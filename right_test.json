    "text": "President Donald Trump issued a statement to corporate media on Saturday, reacting to the declaration that Joe Biden has won the 2020 election.\n\n\"We all know why Joe Biden is rushing to falsely pose as the winner, and why his media allies are trying so hard to help him: they don’t want the truth to be exposed,\" Trump wrote in a statement sent by his campaign.\n\nTrump said the election is \"far from over,\" as Biden \"has not been certified as the winner of any states.\"\n\nThe Associated Press, MSNBC, and CNN called the race for Biden at 11:28 a.m. on Saturday. The network news channels and Fox News followed suit.\n\n\"Legal votes decide who is president, not the news media,\" Trump said.\n\nBiden is currently leading in key swing states the president needs to win — Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Georgia.\n\nThe president said several states remain \"highly contested,\" where his campaign is mounting legal challenges, and other states, such as Georgia, would head to a recount.\n\nThe president also said his campaign will begin prosecuting the legal challenges to the state elections on Monday.\n\n\"The American People are entitled to an honest election: that means counting all legal ballots, and not counting any illegal ballots,\" he said. \"This is the only way to ensure the public has full confidence in our election.\"\n\nThe president asserted that many ballots cast were \"fraudulent, manufactured, or cast by ineligible or deceased voters\" and protested that Republican poll watchers were prevented from witnessing the vote count in Democrat-run areas, such as Philadelphia.\n\nHe criticized the Biden campaign and Democrats for working against his efforts to validate the votes.\n\n\"Only a party engaged in wrongdoing would unlawfully keep observers out of the count room – and then fight in court to block their access,\" he said.\n\nTrump vowed to continue fighting for complete and accurate counts of the votes.\n\n\"I will not rest until the American People have the honest vote count they deserve and that Democracy demands,\" he concluded.",

    "text": "Trump campaign senior adviser Kayleigh McEnany previewed \"a number of affidavits\" to be filed in Pennsylvania Thursday, alleging an \"unequal system.\"\n\n\"You'll hear from the president at the right moment ... right now he's letting this litigation play out, letting his lawyers take the lead on this while he stays hard at work for the American people on COVID and other matters,\" McEnany told \"Fox & Friends\" about President Trump's response to the election results.\n\nMcEnany shared one example from a Pennsylvania voter who alleged she received a ballot in the mail but didn't request one, so she discarded it. When she went to the polls to cast her ballot, she said she was told she had already voted by mail and could not vote at the polls.\n\n\"Separately from that is a big systemic equal protection argument,\" McEnany said, laying out how seven Democrat-leaning counties in the Keystone State were allegedly checking mail-in ballots before Election Day and alerting voters if they were not accurately filled out, but this was not done in the 60 other counties.\n\n\"We have a number of affidavits from voters who were not told to fix their ballot, while their Democrat counterparts in seven counties were, so it was an unequal system and one that disenfranchised some while franchising others,\" she said.\n\nResponding to a Wall Street Journal report that Republican state legislatures could appoint pro-Trump electors who would swing the electoral college in his favor, McEnany said \"constitutionally, that is an accurate argument,\" but now the campaign is \"zeroed in completely on litigation.\"\n\n\"In many of these cities, be it Detroit or Philadelphia, there have been issues for a long time of poll watchers being bullied,\" she said.\n\nMcEnany said she looked through examples of Philadelphia Republican poll watchers who claimed they had racial slurs shouted at them or were escorted out of the room for asking questions.\n\n\"Finally you have a president, who because he won new states in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania ... who's standing up for these forgotten men and women, ... shedding a light on old fraud and old problems with the system that need to be rectified,\" she said.\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Wednesday announced election officials will conduct a manual recount of all presidential ballots as President-elect Joe Biden leads in the state by just over 14,000 votes out of nearly 5 million counted.\n\nMcEnany pointed out that in 2016 there was about a 1% rejection rate on mail-in ballots, but in Georgia, with a huge increase in new mail-in ballots, the state had a 0.2% rejection rate.\n\n\"There are real questions here, a recount is a great next step in Georgia, as are these lawsuits, we just want answers and the American people deserve to ask questions,\" she said.",
