    "text": "WITH A SYMBOLIC poke in the eye of the outgoing Trump administration, President-elect Joe Biden named whistleblower Rick Bright to his transition Covid-19 advisory board. Bright previously ran a division of the Department of Health and Human Services that manages medical response to public health emergencies. Bright was fired in retaliation for standing up to cronyism in the Trump administration's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a detailed complaint he filed in May. \n\n Bright, who has a Ph.D. in virology, will be joined by other experienced public health experts on the board, which \"will consult with state and local officials to determine the public health and economic steps necessary to get the virus under control,\" according to the Biden-Harris transition team. The board will be co-chaired by Dr. David Kessler, who served as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration from 1990 to 1997; Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, an associate professor of internal medicine and public health at the Yale School of Medicine, who has written about racial and ethnic disparities in deaths from Covid-19; and Dr. Vivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general during the Obama administration. \n\n Among the other board members are Dr. Céline Gounder, an infectious disease specialist and medical journalist, and Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and former health adviser to the Obama White House who has blamed the Trump administration's bungling of the epidemic for \"hundreds of thousands\" of unnecessary deaths from Covid-19. \n\n Biden's plans for addressing the coronavirus pandemic include immediately reversing several steps taken by the current administration. The transition team has announced its intentions to restore the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, which Trump folded into another office; rejoin the World Health Organization, which the administration began formally withdrawing from in July; and relaunch the U.S. Agency for International Development's pathogen-tracking program, PREDICT, which the Trump administration stopped funding. \n\n Many of the principles the incoming administration says will guide its approach to Covid-19 — including pledges to listen to science and to promote trust, transparency, common purpose, and accountability in the U.S. government — are corrections to the corruption and incompetence of the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic that Bright described in both testimony before a House subcommittee and his 63-page whistleblower complaint. \n\n While Biden is promising a government in which \"public health decisions are informed by public health professionals,\" Bright shined a light on an environment in which his supervisors at the Department of Health and Human Services pressured him to grant contracts to politically connected companies. In one case, a consultant described a CEO of a pharmaceutical company to Bright as \"friends with Jared\" and someone who \"has Hollywood connections.\" Bright was also one of the first to report on the administration's internal push to hastily greenlight the use of hydroxychloroquine. The FDA approved the malaria medicine, which can cause fatal cardiac complications, as a Covid-19 treatment on an emergency basis — only to later withdraw the approval for the drug and caution against its use.\n\nBright also explained how members of the Trump administration ignored and mocked his attempts to draw attention to the looming shortage of personal protective equipment, particularly N95 masks, as coronavirus infections began to spread throughout the U.S. When he attempted to raise the issue with his boss, Robert Kadlec, and HHS Secretary Alex Azar at a meeting in January, they assured him that the Trump administration would be able to contain the virus and keep it out of the United States using travel bans — and excluded him from further meetings.\n\nBright was later reassigned to National Institutes of Health to work on diagnostic testing. Last month, he resigned from that position and explained in an amendment to his original complaint that he had been given \"no meaningful work since September 4.\"",

    "text": "WE NOW KNOW that Joe Biden will be the next president of the United States — unless something truly strange happens. It seems important to include that caveat, given how the past few years have gone. So let's remember that Biden could die from an addiction to carrot juice. He could take a walk in the Arizona desert, shoot at a 60-foot-tall saguaro cactus with his gun, and then have the damaged cactus topple over onto him. He could be crushed by a chunk of \"blue ice\" plummeting out of the sky as he takes the oath of office on the Capitol steps.\n\nBut no matter what, the Trump era is now over, or at worst, on hiatus. As we take a look back at the past four years, there's one thing we can say for certain: All of America faced a great historical test, and almost all of America failed completely.\n\nDonald Trump made people ask this question for the first time in history: Is there such a thing as a lazy fascist?\n\nBefore Trump, it seemed obvious that fascists were filled with vigor, always available for a mass torch-lit rally at midnight. Trump clearly has the instincts of a fascist: a lust for power, cruelty toward out-groups, and romanticization of a past that never existed. But he also can't execute any plan that requires more than five seconds of effort. Are you a fascist if you vaguely want to be Supreme Leader, but that seems like a ton of work, and your top priority is getting through all the hours of \"Fox & Friends\" on your DVR?\n\nIn fact, Trump's basic life incompetence is so extreme that it's amazing he's only gone bankrupt six times. As president, he couldn't do the most simple things in his immediate self-interest.\n\nFor instance, the U.S. government did have detailed plans and a great deal of expertise to deal with the eruption of something like the novel coronavirus. All Trump had to do was appoint a Colin Powell-like figure to supervise everything, and then get out of the way. This would almost certainly have led to his reelection. But he could not manage this, because he is just a tiny bit of protoplasm attached to an ego the size of the universe. It was more important for him to be on camera every day, musing about how impressed America's top scientists were by his intuitive grasp of microbiology.\n\nTrump also couldn't get it together to push through another economic rescue package. It was desperately needed, Democrats wanted one, Republicans could have been browbeaten into voting for it, and there are few things more popular in an election year than giving people money. Instead, Trump spent his dwindling time in office tweeting about Bill Maher, Beautiful Maine Lobsters, and Patio Pizza in St. James, Long Island.\n\nIt's true the Trump administration has managed to implement policies that blighted the lives of many, many people. But this has been on issues where Trump himself just had to sign papers put in front of him by the small number of his underlings who are minimally competent.\n\nAll that said, there is one area where Trump did not fail. Everyone has a mental map of the world inside their head. Mentally healthy people adjust their interior map when they see it doesn't match reality. Mentally unhealthy people try to force reality to change to match what's inside them. Trump, who is pullulating with hate and fear, has successfully devoted himself to multiplying the amount of hate and fear in the world outside of his head.\n\nThe most terrifying part of the Trump presidency has not been Trump himself, but the slavish support other GOP politicians have given his every action. We now know for sure that there's nothing a Republican president can do that's so grotesque that the rest of the party won't fall in line behind it.\n\nThe most striking example of this has largely been forgotten: During the beginning of his term, Trump could have easily, by accident or design, started a nuclear war with North Korea. Experts at the time believed the odds of war with North Korea were between 20 and 50 percent, and Trump himself later told Bob Woodward that war had been \"much closer than anyone would know.\"\n\nPreviously the U.S. planned only to respond to aggression by North Korea against South Korea or Japan. As reported in the book \"The Bomb\" by Fred Kaplan, Trump demanded that the Pentagon produce a first-strike war plan that could be used simply if the U.S. felt North Korea's actions were threatening. It did not begin with the use of nuclear weapons by the U.S. but could plausibly have escalated to that point.\n\nTrump's insanely threatening rhetoric about \"fire and fury like the world has never seen\" also heightened the possibility that North Korea would believe that it would have to strike first to preempt an attack from the U.S. The situation would have been especially perilous if U.S. officials had followed Trump's order in early 2018 to evacuate the families of American military personnel from South Korea. Fortunately, then-Defense Secretary James Mattis was able to argue Trump out of it.\n\nYet none of this fazed the Republican Party. GOP Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho casually mentioned at an event in Germany that Trump was willing to start \"one of the one of the worst catastrophic events in the history of our civilization. … The end of it is going to see mass casualties the likes of which the planet has never seen.\" Did this make Republicans want to take this option out of Trump's hands and return the power to make war to Congress, as the Constitution dictates? Nope.\n\nSo given that the GOP was happy to let Donald Trump end human civilization, we can understand why everything else Trump did was fine too.\n\nThe most appropriate slogan for Biden's campaign in the spring and summer would have been \"Biden 2020: He's Around Here Somewhere.\"\n\nThe 2020 campaign environment was similar to that of 12 years ago. In the lead-up to the 2008 election, Wall Street imploded in a morass of confusing acronyms. With George W. Bush checked out and John McCain obviously in over his head, Barack Obama was able to become president in the mind of Americans before anyone voted, simply by acting like an adult who understood what was going on.\n\nSimilarly, with Trump totally abdicating any leadership on the coronavirus, Biden could easily have stepped into the vacuum. People wanted basic information, updates, and reassurance that there were authorities somewhere who knew what they were doing. But instead of providing a calm, forceful contrast with Trump, Biden seemed to putter around, not doing much of anything.\n\nThis was one place where Biden could have done the right thing, without violating his centrist instincts or making high-dollar donors anxious. But he didn't even give it a shot.\n\nCan you believe that Joe Biden lost Florida, even as voters overwhelmingly passed a ballot measure to raise the state minimum wage to $15? You should, since John Kerry lost Florida in 2004 by a larger margin than Biden did, even as a similar increase to the minimum wage won 71 to 29 percent.\n\nA decade of work by activists forced Biden to make a $15 federal minimum wage part of his platform. But many voters, in Florida and elsewhere, did not know that. Many others did know it but did not believe Democrats would genuinely fight for it. The Democrats could not make this basic, incredibly popular policy part of their brand, even when faced with Trump, whose core conviction is that American billionaires aren't rich enough.\n\nThe reason for this is straightforward: The Democrats do not, for the most part, represent the bottom 90 percent of Americans. Instead, the Republican and Democratic parties are run by and for different sections of U.S. elites. Democrats therefore can't clearly and powerfully advocate for policies that would harm their elites. This incentivizes them to wander into bizarre cul-de-sacs like Russiagate, where the ratio of effort expended to significance approached infinity.\n\nThe corporate media does not exist to tell people the truth any more than chainsaws exist to brush your teeth. You may be able to clean your teeth with a chainsaw, but only if you're extremely careful. If you just jam it in your mouth every morning, you're going to be disappointed.\n\nThe same level of care is necessary to get much out of the corporate media. Its goal is to make as much profit as possible, and telling the truth is generally not just not profitable, but actively anti-profit.\n\nThe regular corporate press experienced Trump's election as a tremendous shock to its system. It turned out many, many people loathed the media — for some legitimate reasons as well as many illegitimate ones. The corporate press could have used the occasion as an opportunity to rethink everything about how it functions. The late journalist William Greider once imagined a transformed media with \"editors with different kinds of skills (perhaps more like a political organizer's or a priest's) and reporters who were equipped to do a different kind of news — stories that began respectfully with what people needed to understand to focus as citizens, not with the governing agenda of the higher authorities.\"\n\nBut the profit motive means this will never happen. Instead, the corporate press saw Trump in the White House and decided to do exactly what it did before — i.e., try to make as much profit as possible — just now with extra sanctimony.\n\nNot everything about the past four years has been bleak. The immediate resistance to Trump in the streets — seemingly spontaneous but actually built on long-term political organizing outside the two parties — helped block even more egregious actions by his administration. The resurgence of #BlackLivesMatter made it, as Noam Chomsky has called it, \"the biggest social movement in American history with support beyond anything that's ever been registered in the past.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and others have demonstrated that there are far more chinks in the armor of formal politics than the people inside want you to believe. In fact, the Squad & Co. have accomplished so much with such meager resources that it suggests the system is incredibly decrepit and rotten — so much so that a good hard shove might cause much of it to collapse.\n\nBut while the possibilities in front of us are real, we should not deceive ourselves about what we learned about this country during our nightmarish Time of Trump. There are no benevolent adults in charge. Anything at all can happen. The time to start fighting to prevent a future, even more terrifying Trump is now.",

    "text": "AS SOON AS President Donald Trump announced on October 2 at 12:54 a.m. that he'd tested positive for Covid-19, America's national security establishment stirred to life.\n\nNicholas Burns, who worked in both the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations and is now an adviser to Joe Biden's presidential campaign, was tweeting by 7:30 a.m.: \"With the President's illness amid a divisive campaign, we should not discount the possibility that China will step up pressure on Taiwan or Russia seek to take advantage in Eastern Europe.\" By early afternoon Foreign Policy magazine was asking, \"Will Trump's Case of COVID-19 Endanger U.S. National Security?\" Soon Stephen Hadley, once Bush's national security adviser, was fretting that \"some adversaries may think that America may be distracted, so that they can get away with something.\"\n\nWashington, D.C. possesses a wondrous panoply of national security experts like this. Some work at think tanks (funded by huge defense corporations), some are op-ed columnists (whose newspapers run expensive ads from huge defense corporations), while others toil within the executive branch (because they were appointed by presidents funded by huge defense corporations).\n\nSince World War II, these experts have grown used to dominating U.S. politics with ceaseless, lurid warnings about the terrifying dangers we face. First it was the Soviet Union, then China, then Vietnam, then \"terror,\" Iran, Saddam Hussein, \"terror\" again, North Korea, Russia, and, now and always, \"terror.\" In each case, it turned out that the only way to save ourselves was to fork over more money to defense corporations.\n\nBut for the past six months, as the coronavirus exploded across America, D.C.'s foreign policy thinkers have experienced something novel for them: irrelevance. Covid-19 has killed over 210,000 of us, more than 9/11 and the Vietnam, Korean, Iraq, and Afghanistan wars combined. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recently warned that that number may reach 400,000 — that is, as many Americans as died in World War II — if we don't take the necessary actions this fall and winter.\n\n\"The national security threat has arrived on our shores: It is the virus,\" said Stephen Wertheim, co-founder of an anti-interventionist think tank called the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, and author of \"Tomorrow, the World: The Birth of U.S. Global Supremacy.\" Yet for the last half-year, the traditional national security experts were not being invited so much on \"Meet the Press\" nor quoted by the New York Times. They had been wrong all along about what actually threatened Americans.\n\nWith Trump's diagnosis, the mandarins displayed a palpable sense of relief. Here at last was a chance to break out the old hymnal and sing the only songs they know. Americans might think that the danger of two-thirds of the Trump administration entering quarantine would be that they'd be even more incompetent at suppressing the coronavirus. All normal people might have their minds right now on concrete issues, such as the availability of testing or whether it's safe for their children to go to school.\n\nThe national security experts, however, believe that we should focus on amorphous threats from enemies somewhere out there in the hazy mist. Why did Trump have to take a joyride outside Walter Reed hospital? Because \"optics matter right now,\" according to one unnamed administration official. \"Shows of strength and resilience are crucial. For the American public, but also those watching abroad.\" The others are out there, ready to pounce, but were intimidated by Trump's ability to ride around briefly in an armored SUV, exhaling on the Secret Service agents sealed inside with him.\n\n\"Commentators are displaying a uniquely American pathology,\" explained Wertheim. \"There appears to be no event that could happen in the world that would not cause the foreign policy establishment to respond by arguing that the U.S. military must do more and be given more money to do it.\"\n\nIN APRIL 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower delivered what is called his \"Cross of Iron\" speech. It included what are, apart from his warning about the military-industrial complex as he left office, his most famous words.\n\n\"Every gun that is made,\" Eisenhower said, \"every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.\" Specifically, \"the cost of one modern heavy bomber is this … two fine, fully equipped hospitals.\"\n\nThings have changed since then, of course. The Pentagon now famously projects that the F-35 jet fighter will cost a total of $1.5 trillion over the program's life. With the government planning to purchase about 2,500 F-35s from Lockheed-Martin, the price for each individual plane works out to $600 million or so. That's the cost of six present-day hospitals.\n\nThe decadeslong theft that Eisenhower foresaw — the theft of what we now know we desperately need, hospitals and food and the genius of Americans — was largely carried out by our national security experts. You can understand why they're so anxious that we don't notice this, and why they're desperate to get things back to normal so the heist can continue.",
