OTTAWA — Chrystia Freeland shattered a glass ceiling Tuesday, becoming the first woman to be sworn in as Canada's finance minister.  The gravitas of the moment was not lost on the former journalist and mother of three. After she spoke the English words of her oath of office, she paused to take a deep breath, before repeating the oath in French.  \"It's about time,\" Freeland said later at a press conference on Parliament Hill.  She said a feminist agenda has been a key part of the Liberal government, and she is glad to be able to bring her experiences as a woman and a mother to the COVID-19 economic recovery she will now lead.  Lori Turnbull, a politics professor and director of the school of public administration at Dalhousie University in Halifax, said for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to put Freeland in the role is the most substantive move he has made yet to back up his self-proclaimed feminist agenda.  But, Turnbull said, Freeland is not there as a token woman.  \"There are very few people on the political scene in Canada who have proven themselves like she has,\" said Turnbull. \"She is a fantastic choice for finance minister. He knows that.\"  Freeland, 52, has spent the last five years earning a solid reputation both inside and outside of cabinet, first in international trade, then foreign affairs before she was promoted to deputy prime minister and intergovernmental affairs after the 2019 election.  She was credited with leading the successful, though at many times testy and fraught renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, holding so firm against the often unpredictable whims of U.S. President Donald Trump, she managed to get under his very thin skin.  \"We don't like their representative very much,\" he said of her in September 2018.  Just two weeks earlier, Freeland poked the Trump bear directly, arriving in Washington, D.C., for last-ditch trade talks wearing a T-shirt her kids had given her for Christmas the year before. Splashed across the front of the shirt, in bold black letters, it said \"Mama (does not equal) chopped liver.\" On the back it said \"Keep Calm and Negotiate NAFTA.\"  When Trudeau named her deputy prime minister in 2019, he also gave her a mandate letter that had her take the reins on some of his government's biggest, but also most politically tricky, policies: negotiating new health-care agreements with the provinces, climate change and the carbon tax, an assault rifle ban and reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.  While no longer foreign affairs minister, she also retained responsibility for the Canada-U.S. relationship, and as intergovernmental affairs minister, she was dispatched to soothe over the Trudeau government's open sores with mostly conservative provincial premiers.  And while she represents a wealthy, central Toronto riding, she was born and raised in northern Alberta. Those roots mean she has been tasked with bringing some Alberta perspective to the cabinet table. The Liberals didn't elect a single MP in that province and the western anger centred in Alberta over the Trudeau government's energy policies runs loud and deep.  \"She's a Swiss-army knife of cabinet ministers,\" joked Greg MacEachern, a former Liberal ministerial staffer and now a senior vice-president at government-relations firm Proof Strategies.  He said to see how effective Freeland is, one need look no further than how much the Ottawa-Ontario relationship has changed with her lead.  \"Not that long ago, Premier Ford and the Liberal prime minister were using each other as battering rams,\" said MacEachern.  On Tuesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was one of Freeland's biggest fans.  \"There's no one that would be better in that role than Chrystia Freeland,\" Ford said.  While Ford's federal counterparts were dismissing Freeland's appointment as part of the same old Liberal story, Ford offered both the federal government and Freeland his full support.  \"I just want to wish them all the best because they're partners with us,\" he said. \"And I absolutely love Chrystia Freeland. She's amazing. I'll help her. I sent her a message, congratulations. I'm there. I'll have her back. I'll help her any way we can.\"  She was also welcomed by some of the Liberals' biggest critics in the business world. Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, has been highly critical of the pandemic response for small businesses.  \"What I like best about (Freeland) in Finance is her proven ability to work with people, even when there are areas of disagreement,\" Kelly said on Twitter. \"This has been missing in the department for several years.\"  MacEachern said Freeland also has something else outgoing Finance Minister Bill Morneau did not: good and close relationships with many backbench Liberals.  While Morneau went into cabinet immediately upon his election to Parliament in 2015, Freeland had spent time before that as one of just three dozen Liberal MPs when the party sat in third place in Parliament.  Freeland, who worked as a journalist in Canada, the United States, Ukraine and the United Kingdom, was persuaded by Trudeau to enter politics in 2013 to run in a byelection in Toronto Centre. She won, and in 2015, after ridings were rejigged, she ran and won a second time in the neighbouring riding of University-Rosedale.  Trudeau said Tuesday that she had been \"a key player in my government from day one.\"  This report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 18, 2020.

Left-wing billionaire George Soros is apparently planning to dump a cool billion dollars into higher education to focus on teaching about climate change.  He also wants the money to be used to fight nationalism, because he is an open borders advocate.   The Epoch Times reports:  New Soros-Funded University to Combat Climate Change, Nationalism Billionaire currency speculator George Soros says he plans to spend $1 billion to found a global university to combat climate change and burgeoning nationalism in the world, two things he claims in a recent speech are “threatening the survival of our civilization.” The preeminent funder of the activist left in the United States and a major contributor to the Democratic Party, the 89-year-old, Hungarian-born financier announced his ambitious new plan Jan. 23 at the annual globalist gathering of elite business leaders known as the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Soros is an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump. According to Soros’s philanthropic organization, Open Society Foundations (OSF), the project, called the Open Society University Network (OSUN), will “integrate teaching and research across higher education institutions worldwide,” while offering courses and joint degree programs and bringing students and faculty from different countries together by way of in-person and online discussions. Soros is hoping that others will also donate to the endeavor. OSF’s president is Patrick Gaspard, who was then-President Barack Obama’s White House political director.

As wood burns during these fires, it releases aromatic compounds that permeate the grape’s skin and bonds with sugars inside.  Because the blazes were so intense this season, experts say consumers can expect to sip on smoky flavored wine for years to come.  Wine industry expert Burak Kazaz said: ‘There are ways that winemakers can attempt to 'mask' the smoky taste, but it's literally permeated everything from the grapes themselves to the wooden crates and barrels used to store grapes and the finished wine product.’  Wildfires have been blazing in California since August and the intense smoke is not just filling the air, but is making its way into grapes used to make wine  Winemakers have been very concerned about smoke taint over the past few years, as experts warn climate change will only contribute to the number of wildfires each year.  A number of wineries across the world have already been hit hard, with Chile suffering the worst in 2017 that damaged more than 100 vineyards, Wine Spectator reports.  Wildfires have become more common in California and the seasons are starting sooner each year and ending later, which is tainting the state's prized grapes.  Smoke taint of grapes occurs when wood release compounds called volatile phenols that are capable of breaking into a grape’s cuticle and bonding with sugars inside to form glycosides.  As wood burns during these fires, it releases aromatic compounds that permeate the grape’s skin and bonds with sugars inside. Because the blazes were so intense this season, experts say consumers can expect to sip on smoky flavored wine for years to come  And the entire process goes undetected – the only way vintners know the grapes have been compromised is when tasting the finished wine.  ‘Heavy smoke and a burnt flavor is hard to remove, and the effect is cumulative as the state has been hit hard by wildfires for the past few years,’ Kazaz explained.  Experts suggest monitoring smoke density and how long it lingers in an area to predict whether or not it will happen.  Kerry Wilkinson, a leading researcher in smoke taint at the University of Adelaide in Australia, told Wine Spectator: ‘If you are close to the fire but the smoke is blown away from you quickly, the risk of smoke taint is less.’  Wine industry expert Burak Kazaz said: ‘There are ways that winemakers can attempt to 'mask' the smoky taste, but it's literally permeated everything from the grapes themselves to the wooden crates and barrels used to store grapes and the finished wine product  ‘Whereas you could be farther away from the fire, but if the smoke drifts in and lingers in your vineyard, then the risk will increase.’  Researchers at the University of British Colombia unveiled a new innovation in February – a spray that could protect grapes from smoke taint.  The team found that applying an agricultural spray composed of phospholipids -- typically used to prevent cracking in cherries -- to wine grapes one week before exposing them to simulated forest fire smoke significantly reduced the levels of volatile phenols measured in smoke-exposed grapes at commercial maturity.

Unlike the merchant ship that carried a group of European Puritan settlers to a new life across the Atlantic Ocean in 1620, the Mayflower christened by U.S. Ambassador Robert Wood Johnson has no crew or passengers. It will cross the sea powered by sun and wind, and steered by artificial intelligence.  Johnson said the high-tech ship, developed jointly by U.K.-based marine research organization ProMare and U.S. tech giant IBM, showed that “the pioneering spirit of the Mayflower really lives on” in the trans-Atlantic partnership.  “We’re heading out with the same spirit of adventure and determination and vision for the future” as the original colonists, the American diplomat said at a ceremony also attended by the head of the Royal Navy, Adm. Tony Radakin, and Dutch Ambassador Karel van Oosterom.  Like the Mayflower in 1620, the new vessel will travel from Plymouth, England, to Plymouth, Massachusetts, but on a marine research trip rather than a colony-founding journey. The coronavirus pandemic has delayed its trip until the spring of 2021.  The ship’s launch in Plymouth, 200 miles (320 kilometers) southwest of London, is part of Mayflower commemorations disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. They involve British, Americans and Dutch institutions — many of the 17th-century Pilgrims had fled England for Holland in the years before the voyage - and the Wampanoag people, who had lived for millennia in what is now New England.  In 1620, the Wampanoag helped the exhausted Mayflower settlers survive their first winter. But soon colonial expansion, conflict and new diseases were having a devastating impact on North America’s indigenous peoples.  Wampanoag stories have been marginalized on past Mayflower anniversaries, but they are playing a big part in events and exhibitions this time around.  ’It’s going a long way to lend balance to this story,” said Paula Peters, a Wampanoag writer and educator who has helped create anniversary exhibitions, including one opening later this month at The Box museum in Plymouth.  “We don’t expect people to take one side or the other,” Peters said. “But certainly the story of the Mayflower is one that really can’t be told without telling also the story of the Wampanoag.″  The Mayflower voyage plays a central role in American history, but is less studied in Britain. Charles Hackett, chief executive of Britain’s Mayflower 400 events, said he had been surprised how much the story “really resonates and is important to different communities” in the U.K., from the towns that nurtured the Puritans to Harwich, the eastern England port where the Mayflower was built.  He thinks the 17th century voyage, with “people desperately crossing oceans,” also strikes a chord with many in our era of global pandemic, climate crisis and mass migration. While half the Mayflower’s passengers were religious dissenters, the rest “were economic migrants,” he said.  The Mayflower Autonomous Ship - its creators decided against a snappier name - is intended to be the first in a new generation of crewless high-tech vessels that can explore parts of oceans too difficult or dangerous for people to reach.  Andy Stanford-Clark, chief technology officer for IBM U.K. and Ireland, said the ship’s launch “is a very exciting stage of the journey towards autonomous shipping” that could pave the way for AI-driven cargo ships, water taxis and research vessels — as well as warships.  Radakin, the British navy chief, said he was excited by the potential of automation to increase “our availability, our sustainability and our lethality.”  The 50-foot (15-meter) trimaran will undertake six months of sea trials and short trips before setting out on its trans-Atlantic trip to measure ocean health: assessing the impact of climate change, measuring micro-plastic pollution and studying populations of whales and dolphins.  Along the way, its AI captain will have to make complex decisions in response to wind, waves, vessels and unknown surprises.  “We’re quietly confident we’re going to make it,” Stanford-Clark said. “Ultimately, the sea will decide.”  Wednesday’s event on Plymouth’s seafront, yards from where the Mayflower passengers embarked in 1620, was deliberately low-key to prevent large crowds from gathering in breach of social distancing rules. Repeated reminders about hand sanitizer and masks slightly undermined the grandeur of the occasion.  But the Mayflower is woven into the fabric of Britain’s chief naval city, and hundreds of people gathered along the seawall to watch the sleek new ship leave harbor.  Retired teacher Richard Jackelman said he could remember as a boy joining a 350th-anniversary parade dressed as a Pilgrim and making money off the many American tourists who came to town.  “I used to sell bits of concrete here as a kid, saying that the Pilgrim Fathers had sat on it - and the Americans would buy it!” he said.  Jackelman is proud of Plymouth’s association with the Mayflower, which he thinks epitomizes a British spirit of adventure. He’s sorry to see events disrupted because of the pandemic.  “The anniversary means a lot,” he said. “It was going to be such a wonderful year.”   ___  Jo Kearney in Plymouth contributed to this story.

Acting on a public interest litigation filed by advocate Mrinmoy Khataniar and Amar Jyoti Deka, a division bench comprising Chief Justice (acting) NK Singh and Justice Manish Choudhury ordered the 14 respondents including OIL to file their affidavits within two weeks.  The next date for hearing has been fixed as October 20. The bench also considered another PIL filed on the same issue filed by advocate Gautam Uzir.  The petitioners had sought the court’s intervention against Centre’s permission to OIL to drill inside the national park by doing away with public hearing under the draft environment impact assessment (EIA) notification, 2020.  Besides the Centre, Assam government and OIL, other respondents named in the petition include the national board of wildlife, the state board of wildlife and the central and state pollution control boards.  On May 11, the Union forest, environment and climate change ministry had given environmental clearance for extension drilling and testing of hydrocarbons at seven locations by OIL under Dibru-Saikhowa National Park area in Tinsukia district of Assam.  Spread over 340 sq km, Dibru-Saikhowa is one of the five national parks in Assam. The park, which is also a biosphere reserve, is home to 36 mammal species including tiger, Gangetic dolphin, feral horses and 382 bird species.  Concerns about OIL’s drilling plan soon emerged on social media platforms after the company published an advertisement in newspapers recently mentioning the environment ministry’s clearance for the project.  Reacting to the apprehensions, OIL had clarified in May that the company won’t operate inside the national park and the drilling will have no impact on the area as operation would be conducted through extended reach drilling (ERD).  “We will not touch the national park. Drilling will be done from two kilometers away from the park and won’t affect the surface of the park,” OIL CMD Sushil Chandra Mishra told journalists on Tuesday.

Editor’s note: This piece is coauthored by Brett D. Schaefer, the Jay Kingham fellow in International Regulatory Affairs at The Heritage Foundation.  On Dec. 10-11 in Morocco, most of the world’s nations will sign on to the United Nations’ Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration.  The U.S. will not be signing the migration compact — and that’s the correct decision from public policy, national security, and national sovereignty standpoints.  The migration compact was initiated when the U.N. General Assembly unanimously adopted the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants in September 2016.  While the Obama administration enthusiastically supported the New York declaration and the migration compact, the Trump administration has had serious concerns about its provisions and requirements that are inconsistent and contrary to our immigration policy.  On Dec. 2, 2017, the United States announced that it would not participate in the migration compact, as explained by U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley:  America is proud of our immigrant heritage and our long-standing moral leadership in providing support to migrant and refugee populations across the globe. No country has done more than the United States, and our generosity will continue. But our decisions on immigration policies must always be made by Americans and Americans alone. We will decide how best to control our borders and who will be allowed to enter our country. The global approach in the New York Declaration is simply not compatible with U.S. sovereignty.  The decision to end U.S. participation was controversial and unfairly criticized by U.N. officials and human rights groups.  Since the U.S. decision, however, other nations have likewise signaled that they would not sign the migration compact because of concerns that “it tramples on national sovereignty” and “does not distinguish sufficiently between economic migrants and people in genuine need of international protection.”  At least 10 other nations are expected to join the U.S. in not signing the migration compact, including Australia, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Israel, and Poland.  In addition, the compact is causing political controversy and turmoil in some places that its supporters might consider unlikely, such as Belgium, Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands.  The concerns voiced in these countries mirror those of U.S. officials. For example, while the migration compact says that it is the sovereign right of states to “govern migration within their jurisdiction,” they can only do so to the extent it is “in conformity with international law.”  That’s a direct limitation on the constitutional authority of our government to determine our immigration policy regardless of international law.  Similarly, the migration compact says that the due process rights and access to justice provided to migrants must be “consistent with international law.” That imposes another limitation on the authority of the U.S. to determine its immigration policy and the extent of the due process procedures that will be provided to illegal aliens.  There are other, similar caveats contained throughout the migration compact, such as a requirement that a country’s migration policy be consistent with the U.N.‘s nonbinding 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  It directs that detention of illegal aliens should only be “a measure of last resort,” a policy that would release large numbers of illegal aliens into the interior of the U.S., where they could disappear and defy our immigration laws.  The migration compact has many other provisions that would extend asylum rights and provide access to a variety of government benefits far beyond what U.S. immigration law provides.  In general, it is in accord with the push by liberal advocacy groups to extinguish the line between legal and illegal immigration to the greatest extent possible.  In addition, the migration compact states that it rests on a number of international agreements, which is important, considering the compact’s frequent references to international law.  Strangely, it makes no distinction between commitments that are legally binding and those that are not — citing, for example, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, alongside the Paris accord and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  The compact fails to note that not all states have ratified the treaties listed. The United States, for example, has declined to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the Convention on the Rights of the Child; the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, and other treaties referenced in the compact.  The U.S. should avoid even implying that agreements and treaties that it has not ratified constitute binding commitments on this country.  Defenders of the migration compact argue that U.S. concerns are misguided because country commitments under it are nonbinding. Indeed, supporters of the compact lament the lack of a binding treaty on migration.  The purpose of the compact, however, is to be a steppingstone to that goal. To that end, it lays out common commitments and practices on “all aspects of international migration” that signatories will be pressured to honor.  States that fall short of expectations or interpretations of those commitments by the U.N. and nongovernmental organizations will be accused of bad faith and of abandoning their commitments.  We witnessed such criticism when the U.S. pulled out of the similarly nonbinding Paris accord on climate change. Yet, at the recent Group of 20 meeting in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the other governments insisted that the nonbinding Paris accord is “irreversible.”  It is important to note that not signing the migration compact would in no way undermine or reverse America’s generous policy on migration.  The U.S. should work with the International Organization for Migration and other relevant entities to implement the migration compact’s sensible provisions, but it is right to protect jealously its discretion and sovereign authority to set its own migration policies that further U.S. interests.  Signing on to the compact provides no additional authority or ability to adjust U.S. migration policy to meet urgent or ongoing needs. It does, however, serve as an invitation for politically motivated criticism and international pressure.  The U.S. is right to weigh the costs and benefits of this approach and find it wanting. The costs far outweigh the benefits.  Republished from The Daily Signal.

But one of McKay’s most vivid memories from that time was seeing a colleague from Florida filling out his absentee ballot. “I just jokingly said, ’You better hurry up and get that out,” McKay recalls. “It’s going to determine the election.”  Two decades later, McKay has produced the HBO documentary “537 Votes,” a rollicking but precise account of the voter recount in Florida by director Billy Corben and his producing partner Alfred Spellman. The film, which debuts Wednesday on HBO and HBO Max, is a timely reminder of how valuable every vote can be, and the legal battles that can ensue. Corben, the filmmaker of “Cocaine Cowboys” and “The U” and a Florida native, recounts the events from a Miami perspective, opening with the saga of Elián González and tracing how the federal government’s handling of that crisis had enormous ramifications for the vital Cuban-American vote in Florida. All politics, as they say, is local.  It’s also a lively film that resurrects 2000 not just via hanging chads but by following the cultural atmosphere. Alongside interviews with backroom players like Roger Stone, “SNL” sketches make frequent cameos — including some McKay wrote.  In an interview, McKay spoke through a mask by phone from his office in Los Angeles where he’s prepping a comedy for Netflix titled “Don’t Look Up,” starring Jennifer Lawrence as an astronomer who with her partner discovers that a giant asteroid is heading toward Earth. The scientists embark on a media tour to warn a disbelieving population about the planet’s imminent doom.  It’s a return to comedy for McKay, who as a filmmaker has tried out varied degrees of satire, veering from broader comedies like “Step Brothers” and “Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy” to, more recently, increasingly pointed and darker films like “The Big Short” and the 2018 Dick Cheney biopic “Vice.” His projects right now encompass climate change, the pandemic and (in an English-language series based on Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite”) economic inequality. “But we laugh a lot,” he says. “It seems to work.”  AP: What relevance for this November do you see in “537 Votes”?  McKAY: The obvious part of the movie is that every vote counts. Vote. Vote. Vote. But I think there are other layers. It’s a reminder that we’re living in a fairly long story arc that’s more like 30, 40 years long. When you look at what happened in Miami with that recount, it all feels very familiar just based in a state. You see how the Republican party became activist and now fully radicalized party. You really see it happening at that point, and also with the W. Bush administration. And not to let the Democrats off the hook, you also see the DNC become ineffective and watery and — how I jokingly refer to them — become the Washington Generals.  AP: There are sketches glimpsed in “537 Votes” that you wrote. Could you imagine doing that on “SNL” this election?  McKAY: (Laughs) I’m laughing because I occasionally still have work dreams where somehow I’m back there writing. And I’m like, ‘How did I get back here?’ That’s a hard, hard deal. Everyone’s struggling with these times we’re living through as far as comedy goes. So much of the reality became larger than the comedy.  AP: The stakes of this election seem so high, I wonder what role the usual “SNL”-style parody has.  McKAY: The movie we’re making right now is about a comet that’s going to hit Earth. It’s 40 kilometres wide and it’s a planet killer. Two mid-level scientists have to go on a media tour to warn everybody about this. The entire joke is: how do you go on “Morning Joe” and on Twitter and on Colbert when the stakes are the planet really is going to die? I feel like, without exaggeration, that’s a real through line to everything that’s happening right now, with California on fire, democracy toppling, the pandemic. How do you rise to those stakes? I think you’re going to see a little bit of what happened with World War I in culture and art and comedy and music. That’s what surrealism and Dada came out of. The old forms just feel really rickety right now, and not able to contain the stakes.  AP: Is it strange to be working on a film about people denying science when many are rejecting the advice of health officials?  McKAY: I think it’s the strangest thing I’ve ever experienced in my life. I wrote it before this all happened. I wrote it obviously very pointedly toward global warming. It’s not the most clever analogy but I felt like it was a metaphor that could contain a lot. It’s crazy. There are jokes in the script that are exactly happening almost every day. One joke I’ll give away is that they’re passing a funding bill to create the ships to send up to deflect the comet. The president is explaining how they have to play a little bit of politics and there’s a tax cut for the 1%. Sure enough, the first pandemic bill there was a tax cut for the 1%.  AP: You’re currently in pre-production on that after shooting was delayed by COVID-19. How’s it going?  McKAY: So far we’re clean. We had 180 tests last week, zero positives. I think we’re getting new results today, fingers crossed another week of no positives. I don’t know if we’ll be able to do it but we’re going for it. Netflix has been incredible. They’re willing to spend as much as possible to make sure it’s safe, so we’re charging forward.  AP: You’re also developing a series for HBO about the race for a COVID-19 vaccine. It must be difficult when you don’t know how the story ends.  McKAY: Exactly. We, (producer) Todd Schulman and I, felt like we needed something to focus on that’s like potentially a positive, that goes back to those stories of mankind working together as a whole to do great good — the polio vaccine, the mobilization to fight the Nazis.

SAN FRANCISCO — In a year that has already brought apocalyptic skies and smothering smoke to the West Coast, California set a grim new record Sunday when officials announced that the wildfires of 2020 have now scorched a record 4 million acres — in a fire season that is far from over.  The unprecedented figure — an area larger than the state of Connecticut — is more than double the previous record for the most land burned in a single year in California.  “The 4 million mark is unfathomable. It boggles the mind, and it takes your breath away,” said Scott McLean, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire. It is an area that is larger than the state of Connecticut. “And that number will grow.”  Cal Fire said in a statement Sunday that there have been more than 8,200 wildfires since the start of the year that have burned “well over 4 million acres in California” or 6,250 square miles. The previous record was set two years ago when wildfires destroyed 1.67 million acres (2,609 square miles).  The fires of 2020 have killed 31 people, incinerated hundreds of homes and forced thousands of people to evacuate their homes. The enormity of the fires has meant that people living far from the flames experienced a degree of misery that in itself was unprecedented, with historically unhealthy air quality and smoke so dense that it blurred the skies across California and on some days even blotted out the sun. Last month, a relentless heat wave hit the state that helped fuel the fires and caused so much air pollution that it seeped indoors, prompting stores across California to sell out of air purifiers.  Destruction left behind by Glass Fire in Napa, Sonoma counties 1/14   2/14   3/14   4/14   5/14   6/14   7/14   8/14   9/14   10/14   11/14   12/14   13/14   14/14 1 / 14  Despite Sunday's grim milestone, there were signs for optimism.  Powerful winds that had been expected to drive flames in recent days hadn’t materialized, and warnings of extreme fire danger for hot, dry and gusty weather expired Saturday morning as a layer of fog rolled in. Clearer skies in some areas allowed large air tankers to drop retardant after being sidelined by smoky conditions several days earlier.  “In certain areas, we were able to get quite a bit of aircraft in. So we really pounded, a couple different areas hard with aircraft,” Mclean said. “If the weather does what is predicted, we’re on that glide path I hope. But that doesn’t diminish the amount of work that still needs to be done.”  A cooling trend is expected to slowly begin on Sunday. Long-range forecast models hinted at the possibility of rain early next week.  Fire officials said the Glass Fire burning in wine country for the past week was their top priority. Easing winds over the weekend proved a mixed blessing for firefighters battling the giant blaze, which is currently 17 percent contained.  “We are seeing some relief in the weather, but it’s going to be three of four days before it really makes a difference on the fire,” Cal Fire meteorologist Tom Bird said at a Sunday news briefing about the Glass Fire. “The one good thing going forward, we’re not expecting any wind events to push into the fire.”  Three fires, driven by strong winds and high temperatures, merged into one tearing into vineyards and forested mountain areas, including part of the city of Santa Rosa. Thousands of people were under evacuation orders, including the entire population of Calistoga, a town of 5,000.  Across the state about 17,000 firefighters were at work battling nearly two dozen major blazes.  Virtually all the damage has occurred since mid-August, when five of the six largest fires in state history erupted. Lightning strikes caused some of the most devastating blazes. The wildfires have incinerated hundreds of homes and killed 31 people but large parts of them are burning in largely unpopulated land.  Many of the most destructive fires sparked in Northern California, where hills and mountains dotted with many dead trees have provided plenty of fuel for fires igniting amid high temperatures and strong winds fanning the flames. Thick, gray smoke from the blazes has fouled the air in many hill communities and major cities in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond.

President Donald Trump and challenger Joe Biden’s final debate on Thursday was a starkly more civil affair than their messy first showdown.  But that did not prevent the pair from clashing on everything from immigration to racism and even Adolf Hitler.  Perhaps the most startling aspect of the #Debates2020 in Nashville, Tennessee, turned out to be the relative civility compared to the disastrous first debate last month  Jim Watson, Jim Bourg, Brendan Smialowski, pic.twitter.com/qnHmlJtI5f — AFP news agency (@AFP) October 23, 2020  Here is a look some of the key moments of debate:  With the pandemic at the top of American voters’ minds, Biden pledged to get a handle on the virus that has killed over 220,000 in the US — while charging that “anyone who’s responsible for that many deaths” should not remain president.  “We’re about to go into a dark winter. A dark winter,” warned the former vice president, vowing, “I will end this” — though he didn’t say how.  Trump, just past his own brush with the virus, offered his usual sunny take despite cases surging again.  “It’s going away,” he said.  Biden fumed over the report this week that parents could not be located for 545 migrant children separated from their families at the border with Mexico due to US immigration policy.  “Those kids are alone. Nowhere to go. Nowhere to go. It’s criminal,” Biden said, charging that the policy “violates every notion of who we are as a nation”.  Trump retorted that the children were being “so well taken of” while separated from their families.   Face off.

Biden says 220,000 US deaths from coronavirus should disqualify Trump from reelection pic.twitter.com/zEBM5dQdL1 — AFP news agency (@AFP) October 23, 2020  Biden laced into Trump over his attacks on Muslims, insults against Mexico and his failure to condemn far-right extremists at the last debate.  “Come on, this guy is a dog whistle about as big as a foghorn,” Biden growled sarcastically, in a reference to subtle, so-called dog whistle racism.  Trump, for his part, claimed his four years in office have been a time of historic improvement for African Americans.  “I’m the least racist person in this room,” he said.  “Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I have done for the Black community,” Trump added, referencing the US president who moved to abolish slavery in 1863.  As promised, Trump pressed Biden to explain himself to the American people regarding allegations of corruption tied to his son Hunter in China and Ukraine.  “So don’t give me this stuff about how you are this innocent baby,” Trump charged.  “Take a look at the laptop from hell,” he said — pressing Biden on dubiously-sourced reports that incriminating emails had been found on a device belonging to his son.  “Joe, they are calling you a corrupt politician.”  Biden said he has never taken a “penny” from a foreign source.  Trump has always been dubious about human caused-climate change and attacked Biden about his plans to transition the US away from fossil fuels and toward green energy.  “He thinks wind causes cancer, windmills,” Biden said, launching a zinger.  Trump took exception to that allegation, saying “I know more about wind than you do. It’s extremely expensive. Kills all the birds. It’s very intermittent.”  Trump’s bromance with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was targeted by Biden, who accused the president of legitimizing a dictator.  “You know what, North Korea, we’re not in a war. We have a good relationship,” an outraged Trump said.  “Having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing,” he said as the moderator tried to cut him off.  Biden slyly retorted that there were some previous examples of America’s friendly ties with certain leaders not working out in the long run.  “I understand we had a good relationship with Hitler before he in fact invaded Europe.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 14, "positive": 16, "negative": 6, "sadness": 2, "disgust": 3, "joy": 3, "anger": 6, "surprise": 12, "fear": 4, "trust": 3}, "metadata": ["moments", "donald", "trump", "joe", "immigration", "racism", "pandemic", "american", "biden", "virus", "children", "families", "democratic", "hopeful", "election", "university", "coronavirus", "china", "calling", "corrupt", "fossil", "leader", "ties"]}, {"text": "CALGARY, Alberta, Aug. 26, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Gibson Energy Inc.

We have Prince John James Fury, Prince Tyson Luke Fury and finally . . . ”  5 Paris is the perfect comedy foil for her husband in Tyson Fury: The Gypsy King   “What’s his name?”   Sebastian Euripides Wigbert Fury?   “Prince Adonis Amaziah Fury.”   Oooh. So close.  But you get the general drift of things on Tyson Fury: The Gypsy King, an entertaining three-part, fly-on-the-wall ITV documentary about the heavyweight boxer which began with a flurry of jabs, upper-cuts and third-person references, on Thursday.  “When I’m being Tyson Fury, I’m a different person. But when Tyson Fury is at home, Tyson Fury is doing the bins.”  So be in no doubt then, this show is very much a monument to the aforementioned Tyson Fury. One of those rare men who’s both utterly terrifying and surprisingly funny, with more than a hint of Russ Abbot about him, whether he’s careering round Morecambe, with a lovingly restored gypsy wagon, or dive-bombing into his Vegas swimming pool on the morning of his big fight against Tom Schwarz.  5 Tyson has a hint of Russ Abbott - pictured as his character Basildon Bond  The winning thing about TF:TGK, though, is that it’s no one-man band.  It may have been made in his honour, but it has a supporting cast that’s better than most ITV dramas, with the most important member probably being Tyson’s formidable wife Paris, who is the perfect comedy foil for her husband and thoroughly enjoying all the trappings of his success.  “Tyson! Can I take the Ferrari down the hairdresser’s?”  “What are you trying to be posh for?”   “I wasn’t.”  “Take the Roller then.” By far the most alarming family member, however, is Tyson’s food-and-drink obsessed dad/trainer John, who’s just had bad news. He can’t get a US visa for Tyson’s fight, on account of his GBH conviction.  A simple “misunderstanding between travelling folk”, according to John, who ruefully claims: “I’m no more guilty of gouging that boy’s eye out than this cup of tea.”  There’s quite a telling pause before narrator Philip Glenister adds: “The judge disagreed.”  So John must stay at home while Tyson fights. It doesn’t suffer for his absence, though. Indeed TF:TGK ticks along at a cracking pace, right up until those points Tyson begins dwelling on his mental illness, where it begins to drift.  This, I should add quickly, isn’t the boxer’s fault. I’ve no doubt he’s being entirely truthful and sincere whenever he talks about his past battles.   GO ON, TY SON  The problem belongs to television, which has turned mental illness from a taboo to a cliche to an all-consuming parody by encouraging a genuine illness to be hijacked and weaponised by all sorts of charlatans, snowflakes and attention-seekers.  Indeed, on the very same day as Tyson’s documentary was broadcast, This Morning interviewed two women, Pippa Best and Ellie Smith, under the caption: “Climate change is affecting my mental health.”  Climate change is doing no such thing, obviously. It’s just two more people, with a political axe to grind, trying to sneak on board the bandwagon.  Contrary to what some television people obviously think, this doesn’t help raise awareness of mental health issues at all. It dilutes and blurs them.  The sad and immediate result being, I’m as disengaged watching Tyson Fury talk about mental illness as I am transfixed watching Tyson Fury box, Tyson Fury get a parking ticket and Tyson Fury even get this pre-match fight offer from Robbie Williams.  “Do you want to sing on my album?”  Go on, Tyson, son. Someone should. (Tyson Fury: The Gypsy King, ITV, Thursday, 9pm.)

Mervyn lousy at swerving  THE return of Channel 4’s nationwide hide ’n’ seek game Hunted, on Thursday night, was no real substitute for the loss of SAS: Who Dares Wins.  In fairness to the show, though, its production team has jazzed up the format a bit and increased the jeopardy, so contestants are no longer allowed to go on the run with anything other than the clothes on their backs.  5 Mervyn, known as Titch, convinced me he was a master of evasion on C4's Hunted  A breeze, surely, for Mervyn, an SAS Territorial Army veteran with 24 years’ experience of Forces intelligence, who certainly convinced me he was a master of escape and evasion arts.  Right up until the point he went into his bank to withdraw £100 and nodded at the security cameras.  The others didn’t inspire much confidence, either.  Among the first to show their hands were lesbian couple Jess and Ella, who ran around in circles shouting: “Oh s***”, and a noisy couple from Wigan, Dan and Hayley, who cannot shut up about coming from Wigan and headed straight for (any guesses?) Wigan.

Singer needs a tweak  SATURDAY night’s triumphant karaoke finale began with host Joel Dommett asking: “What’s been the best bit about The Masked Singer?”  So I trust we’re all agreed it’s Jonathan Ross suggesting the Daisy outfit was filled by “Natalie Cole”, who’d been dead almost four years by that point.  5 It’s impossible to undermine the dignity of a series like The Masked Singer, where six backing dancers in jellyfish costumes are the norm and the most perceptive judge is Rita Ora Credit: ITV  A suggestion which then sat in an ITV editing suite for another four months before it was broadcast to a gleeful nation, in week five.  On other shows it might have been a franchise-ending mistake. Not here, though.  ’Cos it’s impossible to undermine the dignity of a series where six backing dancers in jellyfish costumes were the norm and the most perceptive judge turned out to be Rita Ora, who nailed all three of the finalists: Katherine Jenkins (Octopus), Jason Manford (Hedgehog) and winner Nicola Roberts (Queen Bee).  That’s not to say, of course, there aren’t structural changes ITV should make before TMS’s well-deserved second series.  An hour and a half is, after all, an eternity to wait for Teddy Sheringham to emerge from his tree.  I might also tinker with the clues, some of which, like the Scarborough postcard, led far too obviously to Jason Manford. While others would’ve had Alan Turing and the enigma code gang scratching their heads.  So the big hedgehog reveal was accompanied by the caption “Jason’s reference to ‘a different stage’ was a nod to his album of the same name”, which reached the giddy heights of No9 in the Scottish album charts.

Carlson said many shun those who ask the questions, and the goalposts that define progress on coronavirus are continually shifting.   Transcript as follows:  CARLSON: Have you been to America lately? A lot of Americans really haven’t. For months, most of us have stayed close to home. We had to.  So the next time you get on a plane and visit a couple of American cities, you may be surprised, especially if you remember those cities well from before the pandemic.  An awful lot has changed in a short time. Many stores and restaurants are closed, you expect that. Churches are locked on Sunday morning. That’s weird.  The streets seem empty, except for the parks which are full of the homeless. When you do see people, they tend to be wearing masks and they won’t get close to you.  It’s a very strange experience. The country has changed a lot. The culture has changed a lot and really not for the better.  So the question is, how long will this last? How long do we have to endure this? When do we get our country back? When can we live like we used to live back in February?  That question is too rarely asked. And in fact, asking it is actively discouraged. At first, you’ll remember, the authorities told us we could resume our lives when hospital admissions tapered off and we flattened the curve. The curve stayed flat, in most places it never bent.  So we get a new benchmark for when we can get back to normal — when we get a vaccine. Everything will be fine once we can vaccinate against COVID-19. Many in authority told us that. They’re still telling us that.  The State of Virginia has announced that when a vaccine finally does arrive, it will be mandatory.  Not all vaccines. Virginia will not require vaccines for hepatitis or HIV. They don’t require a vaccine for meningitis either to fight despite the fact that meningitis kills a lot more say college students than coronavirus does.  But once you get a corona vaccine, they’re telling us, all will be well.  But now they’ve changed that. Not true anymore.  According to a new announcement from the World Health Organization, a vaccine, even if we get one will not be the end of all of this. It will never end.  You can get your injection. They’ll make you get it. But you’ll still be under arrest.  The World Health Organization says that finding a vaccine is not the goal. Reordering society is the goal. Quote, “We will not, we cannot go back to the way things were.” That’s a direct quote from the leader of the World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros, who by the way, is not really a doctor.  Because COVID-19 is not a public health crisis really, or even a mere virus. According to Tedros, COVID-19 is in fact, this may surprise you — COVID-19 is really about global warming.  As he puts it, quote: “The COVID-19 pandemic has given new impetus to the need to accelerate efforts to respond to climate change.” I bet you didn’t see that coming.  Bill Gates did. He agrees to that wholeheartedly. Earlier this month, Gates posted an essay to his personal website, which you probably haven’t seen, arguing that the lesson of the corona pandemic is that the rest of us will have to sacrifice even more to save the Earth from warming.  Now for people who are not billionaire global influencers, this is all pretty confusing. Quick. What does the coronavirus have to do with climate change? Well, for one thing China caused both of them. That’s the obvious link.  But that is definitely not the point Dr. Tedros and Bill Gates are making, both of them bow before China. They would never meaningfully criticize the Chinese government.  So you can be assured that’s not the connection they’re drawing. No.  For Dr. Tedros and Bill Gates, pandemic and climate change share a very different connection. Both are useful pretexts for mass social control. Both are essentially unsolvable crises they can harness to bypass democracy and force powerless populations to obey their commands.  Now it makes sense. Ever wondered why our leaders consider the coronavirus a major public health crisis, but not say, suicides and drug ODs? Well, this is why.  When a 26-year-old mother in New Hampshire drops dead from fentanyl, Bill Gates and Dr. Tedros don’t get more powerful. Her death is useless to them. So they don’t care.  If you actually wanted to improve people’s lives, you would look at things very differently and you would probably reach very different conclusions about the pandemic.  In just a few weeks, a deadly virus spread from central China through Europe to every major city in the West. And as that happened, the World Health Organization did nothing to stop it and in fact, spread disinformation as it was happening. Those are the facts.  So what would a rational person conclude from those facts? Well, the first and most obvious lesson is globalization has risks. It has upsides, of course. Cheaper plastic crap from China, but it also has risks. Pandemics spread very, very fast.  Then, as it happened, our most important international public health organization failed on purpose. It’s corrupt. The W.H.O. is corrupt. That’s a huge problem. That’s the other lesson.  But no one is learning those lessons. When was the last time you heard Bill Gates or Dr. Tedros say those things? Never. They never will say them because they wouldn’t benefit from acknowledging they are true.  This is true about all crises. They only take the lessons that empower them. How about global warming? How would a rational person assess global warming?  If you really believe that carbon emissions were distorting the Earth’s climate, and that’s the claim they make, maybe they’re right, then you would take a very close look at the forces behind those carbon emissions.  You would ask hard questions about the global economy, you’d wonder who is profiting from this system that’s destroying the Earth? How exactly do the richest most powerful people in the world — that would be big finance and the tech monopolies –contribute to carbon emissions? That would be the first question you would ask. That’s the logical way to think about climate change.  And if you began to think that way, you might wind up concluding that people like — I don’t know, Michael Bloomberg were in fact climate criminals. Their private jets alone produce more carbon emissions a year that entire African villages, not to mention more than your neighborhood does, a lot more.  But tellingly, no one on the environmental left ever criticizes Michael Bloomberg. He is considered a leader in the fight against climate change.  On the basis of the numbers that is ludicrous, but they say with a straight face and demand you believe it.  Part of this is human nature. All of us tend to place ourselves at the center, in the heroic center of our own narratives. That’s particularly true of rich people who tend toward the narcissistic.  But in this case, they are evading responsibility. They are profiting directly from a system they claim is unacceptable, but it’s not their fault somehow. You know whose fault it is. Oh, it’s your fault. You’re the one who’s doing it. You’re the one who’s killing humanity. You’re the one who must change.  You’ve got too many kids. You drive a pickup truck. You forgot to wear your little mask. You’re going to hell.  Good luck with your bankruptcies and your opioid crisis and your broken lives, Middle America. We will be at the Yellowstone Club having a drink.  It’s a scam. It’s an obvious scam.  Here’s another data point for you that you won’t see on television. Less than a month ago, on July 31st, the CDC — Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, our primary public health organization funded by the Federal government released guidelines to State Health Department’s about patients infected with the coronavirus,. How do you track the spread of this disease?  In a footnote in the release, the CDC acknowledged that researchers lacked evidence that, quote: “Masks offer any protection against coronavirus,” any at all.  As health officials work to track the spread of the virus, the CDC suggested that they ignore whether or not people were wearing masks.  In other words, wearing a mask may be completely irrelevant to the spread of the virus. So there is still no proof that masks protect us against COVID-19? That is apparently the conclusion the CDC reached. It’s not something Trump tweeted. The CDC put that in a release to the states. It seems like a blockbuster story.  Why isn’t that on page one of The New York Times? Why is the entire media, the entire leadership class of the United States of America ignoring this? Masks are obligatory. They’re mandatory everywhere.  Just the other day, Joe Biden announced that if he is elected, you will be required to wear a mask when you’re alone outside. What is going on? You know what’s going on? Fear works.  The more afraid you are, the more you will accept. Again, a feature of human nature. The more cut off you are from your family and your friends, the more power they have to control you.  This is an election year. Democrats want to win in November. The virus is their main shot to win. Nobody disputes that who’s looked at the numbers.  They’re using fear of the coronavirus to achieve that. For example, polling places. They would like to close more of them. Why? To force a vote by mail.  Why? Because vote by mail is more easy to manipulate.  The latest Coronavirus Relief Bill the Democrats are pushing would bring ballot harvesting to every state. What does that have to do with defeating the virus? Nothing. It’s not science, it’s politics.  But here’s the key thing to remember. All of us are assuming and on the right, it is gospel. This will end if Joe Biden wins. On Inauguration Day, no more lockdowns. Yes, don’t bet on it. This isn’t ending.  The Wuhan pandemic has made our leadership class more powerful than they had have ever been. Why would they relinquish that? The only politician in America who has ever given up power voluntarily is George Washington and they’re toppling his statues.

The concept of a canary in a coal mine – a sensitive species that provides an alert to danger – originated with British miners, who carried actual canaries underground through the mid-1980s to detect the presence of deadly carbon monoxide gas. Today another bird, the Emperor Penguin, is providing a similar warning about the planetary effects of burning fossil fuels.  As a seabird ecologist, I develop mathematical models to understand and predict how seabirds respond to environmental change. My research integrates many areas of science, including the expertise of climatologists, to improve our ability to anticipate future ecological consequences of climate change.  Most recently, I worked with colleagues to combine what we know about the life history of Emperor Penguins with different potential climate scenarios outlined in the 2015 Paris Agreement, to combat climate change and adapt to its effects. We wanted to understand how climate change could affect this iconic species, whose unique life habits were documented in the award-winning film “March of the Penguins.”  Our newly published study found that if climate change continues at its current rate, Emperor Penguins could virtually disappear by the year 2100 due to loss of Antarctic sea ice. However, a more aggressive global climate policy can halt the penguins’ march to extinction.   Stephanie Jenouvrier, CC BY-ND  Carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere  As many scientific reports have shown, human activities are increasing carbon dioxide concentrations in Earth’s atmosphere, which is warming the planet. Today atmospheric CO2 levels stand at slightly over 410 parts per million, well above anything the planet has experienced in millions of years.  If this trend continues, scientists project that CO2 in the atmosphere could reach 950 parts per million by 2100. These conditions would produce a very different world from today’s.  Emperor Penguins are living indicators whose population trends can illustrate the consequences of these changes. Although they are found in Antarctica, far from human civilization, they live in such delicate balance with their rapidly changing environment that they have become modern-day canaries.  A fate tied to sea ice  I have spent almost 20 years studying Emperor Penguins’ unique adaptations to the harsh conditions of their sea ice home. Each year, the surface of the ocean around Antarctica freezes over in the winter and melts back in summer. Penguins use the ice as a home base for breeding, feeding and molting, arriving at their colony from ocean waters in March or April after sea ice has formed for the Southern Hemisphere’s winter season.   Stephanie Jenouvrier, CC BY-ND  In mid-May the female lays a single egg. Throughout the winter, males keep the eggs warm while females make a long trek to open water to feed during the most unforgiving weather on Earth.  When female penguins return to their newly hatched chicks with food, the males have fasted for four months and lost almost half their weight. After the egg hatches, both parents take turns feeding and protecting their chick. In September, the adults leave their young so that they can both forage to meet their chick’s growing appetite. In December, everyone leaves the colony and returns to the ocean.  Throughout this annual cycle, the penguins rely on a sea ice “Goldilocks zone” of conditions to thrive. They need openings in the ice that provide access to the water so they can feed, but also a thick, stable platform of ice to raise their chicks.   Penguin population trends  For more than 60 years, scientists have extensively studied one Emperor Penguin colony in Antarctica, called Terre Adélie. This research has enabled us to understand how sea ice conditions affect the birds’ population dynamics. In the 1970s, for example, the population experienced a dramatic decline when several consecutive years of low sea ice cover caused widespread deaths among male penguins.  Over the past 10 years, my colleagues and I have combined what we know about these relationships between sea ice and fluctuations in penguin life histories to create a demographic model that allows us to understand how sea ice conditions affect the abundance of Emperor Penguins, and to project their numbers based on forecasts of future sea ice cover in Antarctica.  Once we confirmed that our model successfully reproduced past observed trends in Emperor Penguin populations around all Antarctica, we expanded our analysis into a species-level threat assessment.  Climate conditions determine emperor penguins’ fate  When we used a climate model linked to our population model to project what is likely to happen to sea ice if greenhouse gas emissions continue on their present trend, we found that all 54 known Emperor Penguin colonies would be in decline by 2100, and 80% of them would be quasi-extinct. Accordingly, we estimate that the total number of Emperor Penguins will decline by 86% relative to its current size of roughly 250,000 if nations fail to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions.   Stephanie Jenouvrier, CC BY-ND  However, if the global community acts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and succeeds in stabilizing average global temperatures at 1.5 degrees Celsius (3 degrees Faherenheit) above pre-industrial levels, we estimate that Emperor Penguin numbers would decline by 31% – still drastic, but viable.  Less-stringent cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, leading to a global temperature rise of 2°C, would result in a 44% decline.  Our model indicates that these population declines will occur predominately in the first half of this century. Nonetheless, in a scenario in which the world meets the Paris climate targets, we project that the global Emperor Penguin population would nearly stabilize by 2100, and that viable refuges would remain available to support some colonies.   Stephanie Jenouvrier, CC BY-ND  In a changing climate, individual penguins may move to new locations to find more suitable conditions. Our population model included complex dispersal processes to account for these movements. However, we find that these actions are not enough to offset climate-driven global population declines. In short, global climate policy has much more influence over the future of Emperor Penguins than the penguins’ ability to move to better habitat.  Our findings starkly illustrate the far-reaching implications of national climate policy decisions. Curbing carbon dioxide emissions has critical implications for Emperor Penguins and an untold number of other species for which science has yet to document such a plain-spoken warning.

LANSING, Mich. — Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has proclaimed Oct. 7 as Energy Efficiency Day, the Governor’s Office announced Tuesday.  The proclamation encourages Michiganders to embrace energy efficiency habits to meet consumers’ energy needs and make healthier and safer homes and workplaces.  “Michigan has felt the direct effects of climate change, with communities of color and low-income Michiganders suffering disproportionately. That is why I announced the MI Healthy Climate plan to put Michigan on a path toward 100 percent carbon neutrality by 2050,” Whitmer said. “In order to achieve that goal we all have to do our part, and energy efficiency measures are easy ways to create a cleaner environment.”  The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) says simple habits such as switching out old light bulbs for efficient LED ones can lead to big reductions in energy use and utility bills.  Ultimately, these reductions can help Michigan reach its goal of 100% carbon neutrality by 2050.  On Wednesday, Oct. 7 – Energy Efficiency Day – a webinar is being held called the EGLE’s Energy Efficiency Programs for Communities. It will explain how EGLE programs can help Michigan communities that are interested in advancing energy efficiency.  ►Make it easy to keep up to date with more stories like this.

Of the 107 surviving lemur species on the island, some 103 are threatened, including 33 that are critically endangered -- the last stop before \"extinct in the wild\", the International Union for the Conservation of Nature said.  The organization called for a fundamental reimagining of the way humanity interacts with the natural world, in an update to its \"Red List of Threatened Species\".  The list assesses 120,372 species and classifies more than 30,000 species as at risk of disappearing.  The report comes amid growing alarm that the planet may have already entered a period of so-called mass extinction, only the sixth in 500 million years.  The United Nations' biodiversity panel IPBES last year warned that up to one million species faced the risk of extinction as a result of humanity's insatiable desire for land and materials.  Grethel Aguilar, the IUCN's acting director general, said the updated list showed \"Homo sapiens needs to drastically change its relationship to other primates, and to nature as a whole\".  Lemurs, Madagascar's \"treasure\", are among the many precious species unique to the Indian Ocean island.  But the impoverished country is struggling to combat deforestation, poaching for food and the illegal pet trade.  More than 40 percent of Madagascar's original forest cover was lost between the 1950s and 2000.   'Substantial declines'  Among the lemurs newly listed as critically endangered are the Madame Berthe's Mouse Lemur, the smallest primate in the world, and the Verreaux's Sifaka, part of the \"leaping lemur\" family.  Both have seen \"substantial declines\" because their habitats have been destroyed by slash-and-burn agriculture and logging.  Verreaux's Sifaka, which is known in one region as \"sifaka of the cooking pot\", is also threatened by hunting.  \"If you destroy or drastically modify their forest habitats, they cannot survive,\" said Russ Mittermeier, of IUCN's Species Survival Commission Primate Specialist Group.  Across other parts of Africa, 53 percent of primate species -- 54 of 103 -- are now threatened with extinction, driven by bushmeat hunting and habitat loss, the IUCN report said.  Remco Van Merm, from its Global Species and Key Biodiversity Areas Program, said the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic was leaving some poor communities with \"no choice but to resort to using natural resources to meet their daily needs\".  \"We are already seeing increasing levels of resource use, and not only in Madagascar,\" he said, calling for communities to be involved in conservation efforts.  Mittermeier said more lemurs may have already gone extinct if it was not for an initiative that helped fund local projects like ecotourism, reforestation and education.  While he expressed concern over the suspension of tourism due to the pandemic, he stressed that it \"remains perhaps the best tool available\" to ensure the survival of wild lemur populations.   Human threats  Among the other animals added to the IUCN's critically endangered list was the North Atlantic Right Whale, estimating that there were fewer than 250 adults at the end of 2018 -- some 15 percent lower than 2011.  Climate change appeared to be pushing the whales further north during summer into the Gulf of St Lawrence off Canada, where they are more likely to be struck by boats or become entangled in crab pot ropes.  Their reproductive rates were found to have dropped, which was also a factor in driving the European Hamster on to the critically endangered list.  While a female hamster had an average of over 20 offspring a year during the last century, today they give birth to only five or six.  It has now disappeared from three quarters of its original habitat in the eastern French region of Alsace, and more than 75 percent of its territory in Eastern Europe.  Researchers are not sure what is driving the trend, but studies are focused on monoculture plantations, industrial development and global warming.  In 2017, the Research Centre for Environmental Protection in Alsace warned that with vast swathes of land turned over to maize and corn crops, the hamsters' diets had become so depleted of nutrients that they were eating their offspring.

(AP Photo/Chris Jackson)  DANVILLE, W.Va. – As a laid off coal mine electrician, Nolan Triplett doesn't think his industry will ever return to the heady days when it powered America and offered generations of Appalachians a chance at a middle class life.  But he still backs the president who said he'd reopen the mines and put thousands back to work, even if such promises proved empty.  “Even if I don’t go back to this industry, I’m still with him,” said Triplett, 41, outside a mine worker certification office in Danville, a town of about 700 people along the Little Coal River in Boone County south of Charleston.  Four years after Donald Trump donned a miner’s helmet at a West Virginia campaign rally and vowed to save a dying industry, coal has not come roaring back. The fuel has been outmatched against cheaper, cleaner natural gas and renewable energy.  But many West Virginians applaud Trump's efforts and remain loyal as he seeks a second term. Triplett and other voters say they are attracted to his “America First” slogan and anti-abortion stance, and figure he's the only one standing in the way of the entire industry closing down.  “He’s done good for this country all around,\" said Triplett, who lost his last mine job when the pandemic hit.  Democrat Joe Biden, who calls global warming an existential crisis, has promised to steer investments to coal and power plant communities, creating new jobs in renewable energy.  But many in coal country seem more intent on blaming the climate-change messenger than considering his plans for growth.  Next to Triplett stood Ronnie Starr, who lives near the Kentucky border in Mingo County, the scene of a legendary shootout over labor rights in the mines a century ago. He's had to move as far as Alabama to find work as a mine electrician since he started in the early 2000s, and is also out of a job now. He said the last Democrat he voted for was Bill Clinton, and he enthusiastically supports Trump.  “You got the right president, things go good,” said Starr, 43.  “And you got one group that hates us with a passion and would rather see us starve out and die,” Triplett cut in, “then you get another group that supports us, so it’s a rollercoaster.”  Since 2014, West Virginia has lost nearly a third of its remaining full-time coal jobs as production declines, starving local governments of revenue. When Trump took office in January 2017, Boone County received nearly $269,000 in quarterly coal company severance taxes. This October, it got just $42,300.  Nationally, cheap natural gas is beating coal on the market and coal-powered plants are closing. Coal consumption decreased nearly 15% in 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  In 2016, the federal agency reported the industry’s worst jobs record since it began collecting this data in 1978, showing a yearly average of 51,795 employees at U.S. coal mines. Employment increased by a marginal 1.9% as of 2019.  “The coal jobs did not come back as the president promised,” said U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, a rare Democrat still thriving in West Virginia. “The markets have shifted.”  Anthony Starkey, a retired miner in Danville, said Trump earned his vote again by signing a bill last year to save the pensions of some retired coal workers, including his own.  “He’s a typical New Yorker, he’s arrogant,” Starkey said, pausing while mowing the lawn outside the Independent Order of Odd Fellows lodge in Madison, the Boone County seat. “Whether you love him or hate him, he’s done what he’s said he’s going to do.”  Starkey, 62, said he was a Democrat all the years he worked as a miner, starting at about 17 in the early 1980s. He retired early at 38, drawing from a pension that nearly got wiped out as coal companies that paid into the fund went bankrupt. The relief Trump signed replaced corporate spending with $10 billion in public dollars to rescue pensions for 92,000 retirees, and health benefits for 13,000.  “If he was a typical Republican, he would not have signed that bill,” said Starkey.  Business has fallen off in the Danville hardware store Fred Byrnside, 73, has run for 30 years. “There was a time when 24-year-olds were getting jobs here in the mines,” he said.  “One time he could buy me lunch, and now he can’t afford it,\" cracked Craig Bratcher, a Boone County commissioner who stopped into the store.  Bratcher, who describes himself as a moderate, wouldn't say who he’ll vote for, but offered a forgiving assessment of Trump.  “He’s come in and he’s tried,” he said. “I’ll give him this.”  But he and others admit there’s no saving the industry. Although many won't forgive President Barack Obama for pushing to curtail carbon-polluting coal, Bratcher said the decline started before his inauguration.  That skepticism about coal's future is widely shared, even among Republican officeholders.  “I don’t think anyone thinks it’s a growth industry,” said Republican U.S. Sen. Shelley Capito, who is seeking re-election as a Trump ally. “What we’ve gotten with the president is a stabilization of the coal industry.”  It doesn't seem to matter much to these voters that Trump promised more than stabilization: “We’re going to put the miners back to work!” he told a campaign rally in Charleston in May 2016. “We’re going to get those mines open.”  That hasn't happened, even as Trump has rolled back some Obama-era regulations, such as one aimed at reducing contamination from the wastewater that coal-burning power plants release into streams, lakes and underground aquifers.  Richard Lalonde, a registered Democrat, still works at 82 inside a thrift shop he and his wife own in Madison, where a coal mining museum promises it is “preserving the past for future generations.” He said he remains uncommitted as to his choice on Election Day, after supporting Trump in 2016. But he's blunt about coal's promise for his town's economy.  “It’s never going to be like the way it was before,” he said. “Around here it’s done.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 11, "joy": 5, "negative": 6, "sadness": 1, "disgust": 3, "positive": 19, "anger": 7, "surprise": 11, "fear": 5, "trust": 6}, "metadata": ["coal", "donald", "trump", "virginia", "campaign", "vowed", "fuel", "cleaner", "renewable", "america", "pandemic", "joe", "global", "warming", "existential", "investments", "climate-change", "labor", "supports", "consumption", "independent", "corporate", "craig", "obama", "charleston", "wastewater", "election", "blunt"]}, {"text": "The blockchain platform will guarantee the security and confidentiality of the cattle producers' data;  The investment fund created by the company will promote the socioeconomic development and conservation of the Biome  SÃO PAULO, Oct. 19, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- With the aim of increasingly sustainable production, JBS is announcing the Together For the Amazon program, a set of initiatives that seeks to enhance conservation and development of the Amazon Biome, engaging the industry and proposing actions that go beyond its value chain. The program encompasses climate change, which was allocated priority within the JBS global sustainability targets presented in 2019.  The fundamental pillars of the Together for the Amazon program are: (i) development of the value chain; (ii) forest conservation and restoration; (iii) support for the communities; and (iv) scientific and technological development.  The first pillar consists of the JBS Green Platform, a ground-breaking initiative that will cross-check information of the Company's direct suppliers with livestock transportation data from preceding links in the supply chain. By using blockchain technology, the company will guarantee the confidentiality and security of the personal, commercial and sanitary information of the producers, as well as transparency in the analyses of the suppliers.  The Company will also launch engagement campaigns so that, by the end of 2025, its suppliers' suppliers are also on the JBS Green Platform. In addition, JBS will provide legal, environmental and animal husbandry advisory to assist producers with improvements in stewardship and the environmental regularization of their properties, while also expanding its educational actions in sustainability to its supply chain.  For over a decade, JBS has been monitoring 100% of its cattle supplying farms using strict sustainability criteria, including zero tolerance of deforestation, encroachment on protected areas like indigenous lands or environmental conservation units, hard labor, or the use of areas embargoed by Ibama. This daily analysis covers more than 50,000 properties in the Amazon region, an area greater than the size of Germany.  \"We are publicly reiterating our commitment to the sustainability of the Amazon. We hope to scale up, not only in combatting deforestation, but also in fostering the bio-economy, sustainable agriculture and social development\", says Gilberto Tomazoni, Global CEO of JBS.  JBS Fund for the AmazonThe other three pillars will be achieved through the JBS Fund For The Amazon, created to finance initiatives for expanding forest conservation, promoting sustainable development of the local communities, as well as scientific and technological development, with a contribution of R$ 250 million over the first five years. With the participation of other stakeholders, the target is to reach R$ 1 billion by 2030.  The Fund will be headed up by Joanita Maestri Karoleski, former CEO of Seara, with the support of a Board of Directors, a Fiscal Council, a Consultative Council and a Technical Committee.

Old, out of touch, disingenuous. And, of course: who's that?  As the 2020 campaign intensifies, a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research asked Americans to say what word or phrase comes to mind when they think of the top candidates, including incumbent President Donald Trump.  Each received both positive and negative responses; In some cases, a sizable share didn't know enough about the candidate to give a description.  Here's a look at how Americans characterized the contenders:   BIDEN  Many Americans think of the former vice president's job when asked about Joe Biden, but one response ranked above all others: He's \"old.\" Sixteen percent of those thinking of a phrase to describe Biden mention his age, including comparable shares of Democrats and Republicans.  One 34-year-old Democrat said he is \"living in the past,\" and others called him \"past his prime.\"  About 1 in 10 either identify him as former vice president or think of former President Barack Obama. Biden has spent much of the campaign drawing on his connection to the first African American president.  Another 5% criticize his intellect or speaking skills, like calling him \"bumbling,\" as one 78-year-old did, or mentioning gaffes.  Still, about 2 in 10 speak fondly of Biden, including many saying he is experienced or \"good.\"  \"Kind heart. Good man,\" said one 41-year-old man.   BLOOMBERG  The billionaire is known for just that: About 3 in 10 of those describing former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg mentioned his wealth, or suggested he was buying the election. Many simply said \"money\" or \"rich.\" A 62-year-old Democrat described him as \"buying votes.\"  Some others described Bloomberg as dishonest, calling him names like \"liar.\"  Still, close to 2 in 10 Democrats included positive words on Bloomberg, including \"action oriented,\" and \"intelligent.\"   BUTTIGIEG  Pete Buttigieg sees more variation in the types of words people use to describe him. About 1 in 10 call out his age, saying he's \"young.\" Roughly another 1 in 10 mention that he's smart and a similar share call him inexperienced. The 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, entered the contest distinguishing himself from his septuagenarian rivals, and advocating for Democrats to turn the page.  \"Capable but inexperienced,\" said one 73-year-old Democrat.  Another Democrat considered his age a benefit, not a flaw: \"Young and new ideas,\" the 40-year-old said.  Also distinguishing Buttigieg: He would be the first openly gay U.S. president. About 1 in 10 mention his sexual orientation.  Overall, about 4 in 10 Americans don't have something to say about Buttigieg.   KLOBUCHAR  Amy Klobuchar is a moderate, a midwesterner and among those running to be the first woman president of the United States. While those who describe her think of these and more, none stands above the others.  No single response is used by more than 6% of those describing the Minnesota senator. About half of Americans, including about 4 in 10 Democrats, don't give a description.  Among Democrats, 1 in 10 think of her intellect, calling her \"smart,\" and 6% mention her centrist ideology and \"pragmatism.\" Some give negative reactions, including a few saying she is \"mean to her staff\" — a widely reported news story early in the campaign. Others just called her \"ok.\"  But more are generally positive, using words like \"reasonable,\" \"strong\" and \"sincere.\"  \"Rational and experienced,\" said one Democrat, 67.   SANDERS  About a quarter name liberalism, socialism or communism when asked to think about Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator has forcefully pushed the Democratic Party left with grassroots campaigns in both 2016 and 2020, calling for overhauls to health care, Wall Street and higher education. While Republicans are especially likely to mention ideology, nearly 1 in 10 Democrats do, too.  Some call him \"crazy.\" Like Biden, Sanders also gets knocked for his age, with roughly 1 in 10 calling him \"old.\"  \"Too extreme and too old\" said one Democrat, 55.  But among Democrats, many describe Sanders as \"smart,\" \"great\" or \"honest,\" or make references to health care policy.  \"Leader of the future,\" offered a 28-year-old Democrat. Another Democrat, 62, called him a \"warrior for the people.\"   STEYER  Like Bloomberg, Tom Steyer is known for being \"rich,\" with wealth mentioned by 14% of those who volunteer a word to describe him.  One 30-year-old Democrat says he is \"trying to buy the election.\"  About 1 in 10 point out the businessman's first foray into politics, such as saying he is \"inexperienced\" or \"unknown.\" Overall, about half of Americans don't know enough to give a reaction to Steyer.  Another Democrat, 72, focused not on his wealth but on his chances: \"Down to earth but not up to challenge.\"  Five percent of Democrats mention climate change, an issue he has championed.   WARREN  Americans don't coalesce around one way of describing Elizabeth Warren. A sizeable share think of \"dishonest\" and \"lies\" — descriptions that are concentrated heavily among Republicans. Five percent of those describing her mention her left-leaning politics. Similar percentages call her \"smart\" or \"strong.\"  Among Democrats, descriptions focus on strength, a willingness to fight and competence.  \"Intelligent and well-seasoned,\" says one Democrat, 45.  \"She has a plan!\" says another, 60, referencing the early-adopted mantra of the Massachusetts senator's campaign.   TRUMP  As is the case for most measures of the president, the words offered to describe him are deeply partisan.  Close to 2 in 10 Republicans describe Trump's leadership or his presidency. Others called him \"good\" or \"honest.\" Trump faces almost no challenge for the Republican nomination, and responses suggest that's just fine with his supporters.  \"Greatest president ever,\" said one Republican, 63. Many volunteered Trump's 2016 campaign slogan: MAGA. A 68-year-old woman called him a \"great leader.\"  Still, some Republicans went negative, including calling him \"arrogant\" or a \"liar.\"  Meanwhile, Democrats volunteered those and many other negative words in reaction to the president. Many labeled him \"evil,\" \"racist,\" \"corrupt\" and a \"bully.\"  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 7, "positive": 26, "negative": 4, "disgust": 1, "joy": 2, "anger": 10, "surprise": 2, "fear": 1, "trust": 3}, "metadata": ["washington", "campaign", "donald", "biden", "joe", "american", "calling", "mentioning", "bloomberg", "mayor", "mike", "united", "minnesota", "ideology", "sanders", "bernie", "vermont", "democratic", "grassroots", "republicans", "steyer", "tom", "wealth", "volunteer", "focused", "climate", "warren", "elizabeth", "willingness", "massachusetts", "trump"]}, {"text": "FREE now and never miss the top politics stories again.

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as the Democratic candidate for vice president is a suitable final step in the increasingly goofy Joe Biden campaign, prior to next week’s virtual Democratic convention.  She was a catastrophic candidate for the presidential nomination, starting out as a strong rival to Marxist Sen. Bernie Sanders, and like Biden himself and all the others except Mayor Pete Buttigieg, her candidacy sank like a rock.  Almost every policy question was answered with a pious assertion of the need for \"a national conversation.\"  If her proposals had been acted upon, the country would have been swept by a pandemic of logorrhea (the inability to stop talking).  Harris favors open borders and compared the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) service to the Ku Klux Klan.  She favors the entire Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,D-NY., Green Terror, including abolition of fracking and ultimately of fossil fuel consumption and use, and the now customary Democratic hare-brained nonsense about windmills and solar panels. (At the confirmation hearing for James Mattis as secretary of defense, she asked him how he would combat climate change.)  She favors free full-service public healthcare for everyone, sharply increased taxes, and the confiscation of privately owned firearms — Beto O’Rourke could soon be on every doorstep in America.  Harris has many critics among the 98% of Democrats who did not support her candidacy for president.  The Left is displeased with her performance as San Francisco’s district attorney and as attorney general of California: she always called for maximum sentences and condoned the widespread American practice of prosecutors extorting or suborning inculpatory false evidence by threats of indictment if that evidence is not forthcoming, and promises of immunity from prosecution for perjury if it is.  Loyola Law Professor Lara Bazelon recently accused Harris in The New York Times of having \"fought tooth and nail to uphold wrongful convictions that had been secured through official misconduct that included evidence tampering, false testimony, and the suppression of crucial information.\"  President Trump has made serious efforts at penal reform and sentence reduction for nonviolent offenders.  By contrast, Harris sent over 1,000 marijuana users to prison but acknowledged having tried it herself.  Harris’s performance as a prosecutor clashes with the general current Democratic enthusiasm for defunding and discouraging the police and turning a blind eye to urban vandalism, arson, and looting.  Biden backed himself into a corner through his malapropistic aspersions of African Americans and the claims against him about molestation of women (claims Harris once endorsed), and pledged a black female candidate.  Those who met those criteria were a pretty job lot. Rep. Val Demings of Georgia was promising but obscure; former National Security Advisor Susan Rice is tainted by the Benghazi fiasco and her role in the persecution of Gen. Michael Flynn, and is sometimes unacceptably abrasive.  Rep. Karen Bass of California is, on her record (including her public condolences to the people of Cuba over the hardly premature death of Fidel Castro), a Communist; and unsuccessful Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacy Abrams is a deluded fabulist and would have been a preposterous choice.  In the valley of the African-American Democratic female politicians, the chronic \"conversationalist,\" Sen. Harris wins.  The Democratic National Committee (DNC) and its media allies have already warned that any criticism will be portrayed as sexist and racist, but that charade has become tiresome.  The vice presidential nominee’s prospects are clouded by the apparent expectation (according to a Rasmussen poll) of 59% of Americans that, if elected, Biden will not finish his term for medical reasons (despite his well-filmed weekend bicycle ride of 75 yards).  So more than half the electorate thinks a vote for the Democrats will be for both Biden and Harris to be president.  There is nothing in her performance in office or as a presidential candidate to indicate that Americans would greet a Harris presidency with equanimity.   Whatever happens, she wins.  If the ticket is successful, her chances of being president are excellent. If Biden completes his term, Harris is the principal candidate to follow him.  And if the Democrats lose, the ranks of defeated vice presidential candidates include many who went on to greater things: Franklin D. Roosevelt, Earl Warren, Edmund Muskie, Robert Dole, Walter Mondale, and Lloyd Bentsen.  The Biden-Harris tandem kicked off with Biden’s monstrous lie that Trump demonstrated his support for Nazism at the violent demonstrations in Charlottesville in 2017, one of the opening guns in the Democratic media character assassination of the president.  What he actually said was that there was merit to the arguments of both sides in the original controversy in Charlottesville over what to do with the statue of Robert E. Lee, and that in the violence that ensued both sides were equally odious.  In the ensuing false controversy whipped up by the Trump-hating media, there were some hilarious acts of moral posturing, such as corporate raider Carl Icahn resigning from a White House cultural committee. (Trump abolished the committee as redundant.)  This is where the Democrats have arrived: where they began, accusing Donald Trump of every conceivable permutation of bigotry and corruption.  The Democratic media made no reference whatever to the shooting of 21 African Americans in Washington, D.C. in one incident last weekend, but the Democratic mayor, the egregious Muriel Bowser, ignored the shooting and complained that her ban on assemblies of more than 50 people was sometimes not observed.  World-famous Michigan Avenue in Chicago was smashed up which at least caused the hopeless mayor, Lori Lightfoot, to acknowledge for the first time that some of the peaceful protesters were committing crimes, but she publicly warned her police chief not to \"bait\" her.  The Big Apple naturally has the most incompetent mayor of all: Bill de Blasio blamed his city’s skyrocketing violent crime rate on the summer and the coronavirus.  His abrupt chopping of the entire crime prevention unit and of $1 billion from the city police budget, of course, had nothing to do with it.  And New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, ducked his own responsibility in sending COVID-19 sufferers back to homes for the elderly and blamed unspecified Trump regulations and visitors and nurses for 19,000 deaths in those facilities, a number greater than the combined total of coronavirus fatalities of Germany and Canada, countries which have a total population of 120 million.  And in Washington, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., returned to her script of four years ago and incanted, \"With Trump, all roads lead to Putin.\"  She said that it didn’t matter that China favors Biden in the election because the United States has no problems with China.  For nearly four years the Democrats and the self-shamed legions of their national political media accomplices have had no narrative except constant, 360 degrees, stentorian defamation of the president.  It's the most protracted and despicable performance of a major American party in opposition since the Democrats betrayed their own president (Lyndon Johnson), spuriously destroyed President Nixon, and completed the trifecta by withdrawing all aid to Indochina and consigning it to the tender mercies of the North Vietnamese Communists and Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge.

As the focus of the US election campaign switched to the deadly blazes, Democratic challenger Joe Biden slammed the incumbent as a “climate arsonist” and said America would not be safe from the ravages of a warming planet unless it elects “a president who respects science.”  Infernos across California, Oregon and Washington state have burned more than five million acres (two million hectares) this year, killed dozens of people and forced hundreds of thousands from their homes.  Whole towns have been ruined by the blazes, which have pumped out tonnes of noxious fumes that have hung in the air for days, blocking out the sun and making breathing difficult.  But Trump, in Sacramento on the third day of a re-election campaign swing, pushed back against state officials arguing that a heating climate underlies the ever-stronger fires.  “It will start getting cooler. You just watch,” Trump said, offering no evidence for the theory.  “I wish science agreed with you,” responded Wade Crowfoot, the head of the California Natural Resources Agency.  “I don’t think science knows, actually,” Trump said.  Reputable scientists around the world are almost unanimous in their belief that the world is getting warmer because of human activity.  This man-made climate change amplifies droughts, which dry out regions, creating ideal conditions for wildfires to spread out-of-control and inflict unprecedented damage.  Trump also repeated his argument that wildfires are caused by poor maintenance of forest areas, making them more combustible.  “There has to be strong forest management,” he said.  “With regard to the forests, when trees fall down after a short period of time, about 18 months, they become very dry. They become really like a match stick,” he added. “They just explode.”  Biden, speaking at his own campaign event on the opposite coast, said Trump’s re-election would be catastrophic for the environment.  “If you give a climate arsonist four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised if we have more of America ablaze?” Biden said, savaging Trump for failing to “take responsibility” for the ongoing wildfire crisis.  “We need a president who respects science, who understands that the damage from climate change is already here.”  California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has argued that the fires are driven mostly by global warming, acknowledged as he met with Trump that better forest management was needed, but insisted the overwhelming cause of the problem is far bigger.  “We submit the science is in and observed evidence is self-evident: that climate change is real and that is exacerbating this,” he said.   ‘Elect a climate president’  Much of the West Coast has been blanketed in choking smog for days, with Portland on Monday the world’s most air-polluted city according to IQAir. Washington state Governor Jay Inslee said it was crucial voters elect a “climate president” come November 3.  “This moment requires action, not denial,” he said in a tweet. “We must come together around science to build a better future for all Americans.”  Most of the 35 deaths so far confirmed have occurred in California and Oregon, where the wildfires are the worst in decades and have been fueled partly by record heat.  More than 30,000 firefighters are battling the blazes, with wind gusts and drier weather on Monday threatening more destruction.  Residents of Arcadia, on the outskirts of Los Angeles, were ordered to evacuate Sunday as the nearby Bobcat Fire spread south through forested terrain toward the metropolis.  Two new deaths were confirmed from the North Complex Fire, which swept at unprecedented speeds last week into areas already ravaged less than two years ago by the Camp Fire -- California’s deadliest ever blaze.  “There are still active fires, power lines are down, trees are down, there are roads that are impassable,” said Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea, warning evacuees it could take “weeks and weeks” to return to their homes.  He said seven people remained missing.  Paul Clement described to AFP how he fled his home in Berry Creek.  “When I came around the bend, everything was on fire -- an entire hillside. So I ended up driving through and you couldn’t see 50 feet (15 meters).”  “It was worse than the Camp Fire, which I didn’t think was possible.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 5, "positive": 19, "negative": 1, "disgust": 1, "joy": 2, "anger": 8, "surprise": 9, "fear": 15, "trust": 6}, "metadata": ["united", "donald", "trump", "global", "warming", "reverse", "dismissed", "climate", "fires", "election", "campaign", "democratic", "joe", "biden", "america", "washington", "blocking", "arguing", "heating", "california", "scientists", "warmer", "wildfires", "unprecedented", "catastrophic", "failing", "ongoing", "understands", "exacerbating", "evacuate"]}, {"text": "My reverence for the natural world runs deep. From childhood I knew that all we inherit, honed by earlier generations, is a gift from God to be treasured.  Though this inheritance includes precious, man-made traditions and the institutions which give them life, even more fundamentally it comprises the riches of nature – the soil and seas, with all the living things which occupy both.  The tragedy of our own era combines a delusional mix of insatiable hunger for material satisfaction and a militant obsession with the weather.  MP Sir John Hayes (40069513)  The first prioritises quick thrills over lasting sentiments as, preoccupied by crass convenience, consumers greedily clutch their shiny acquisitions, delivered to their door by operatives they will never know. What a contrast with the joy of looking forward to a longed for treat purchased from a well-known nearby shop, or perhaps a market stall, from a local person who you’ve likely known for years.  The second element of the tragic modern perspective draws on a long history of fatalism which has fed human insecurity since time began. Well I remember the sandwich boards, once more familiar, which broadcast that ‘the end is nigh’. Now, juveniles are encouraged to fear that the world is imminently doomed because of changes to the climate. Presumably, they don’t know that similar predictions were made decades ago.  It is axiomatic that protecting nature is a pivotal imperative. Who with any sense would disagree with action to purify the air we breathe, cleanse our seas, use energy more efficiently and protect our nation’s countryside from overdevelopment.  However, equally important is ensuring that thoughtful, evidence-based policy does not get lost amongst the shrill siren calls of zealots for whom nothing short of the demise of humanity will suffice. As Bjorn Lomborg’s new book, False Alarm: How Climate Change Panic Costs Us Trillions, Hurts the Poor and Fails to Fix the Problem, makes so persuasively clear, ordinary people have been needlessly terrified by those who falsely decree that the apocalypse is upon us.  It is important not to be confused by alarmists. For example, here in South Holland earlier this year we witnessed an immense volume of rain which, like many unusual weather events, was extraordinary, but not unprecedented. Records showed that it was equalled in two years since the mid-19th century, long before the doom-mongers began attributing all human ills to climate change.  Both feckless materialism and militant climatism seek in vain to fill a void that was once occupied by family bonds, communal ties and straightforward common sense. Those preoccupied by one, the other, or both, are desperately seeking a sense of meaning beyond puerile popular culture which, having lost faith in the divine, they are too unimaginative to gain.  A better future depends on harnessing human ingenuity to spark real changes. In addition to sensible measures designed to clean the air and sea, we should also grasp positive opportunities for innovation and design, more fuel-efficient cooling systems, ambitious plans for more green space and even ensuring that the surfaces of infrastructure – roads, buildings, etc. are lighter in colour, thus heating urban areas less rapidly and would all make a quantifiable difference.  As Minister for Transport, I led work supporting the car industry’s quest to deliver value for money, optimal performance and sustainability from electric cars, and promoted carbon capture and storage.  At that time, I recall asking whether we wanted people to travel more or less? My query was regarded with bafflement as the prevailing assumption was that people should travel ever further and more frequently. In fact, far from being desirable, many journeys are obligatory as we are forced to go further to do what is necessary. Successive governments have failed to grasp this truth which is why locally, in common with other places, we have lost our magistrates court, tax office and driving test centre.  Now we must take post-COVID opportunities to reshape our lives. In making them more sustainable and meaningful, Government must do more to strengthen localities and, by doing so, discourage undesirable journeys.  With new meaning in mind, we can all do more.  Making a difference includes planting trees and shrubs that provide habitats for wildlife – just look at the wonderful work done by Nicholas Watts on his farm in Deeping St Nicholas - and, starting from today, we can all use less plastic; travel less by shopping closer to home; choose holidays in the UK; and walk and cycle as much as we have during lockdown.

On Wednesday, pressed at her confirmation hearing by Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Barrett framed acknowledgment of manmade climate change as a matter of policy, not science.  Barrett said Harris, the Democrats' vice presidential nominee as well as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, was trying to get her to state an opinion 'on a very contentious matter of public debate, and I will not do that.'  Barrett was responding to a series of questions from Harris, including whether she thinks the novel coronavirus is infectious, whether smoking causes cancer and whether 'climate change is happening and it's threatening the air we breathe and the water we drink.'  The federal appeals court judge responded that she does think coronavirus is infectious and smoking causes cancer. She rebuffed Harris on the climate change question, however, for seeking to 'solicit an opinion' on a 'matter of public policy, especially one that is politically controversial.'  The exchange occurred during the committee's hearing on Barrett's nomination to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court.  Scientists say climate change is a matter of established fact and that the damage is mostly caused by people burning oil, gas and coal. Climate experts, including federal scientists in the Trump administration, say increasingly fierce wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters point to the urgency of global warming.  Acknowledging and dealing with climate change are politically laden issues. President Donald Trump, an ardent booster of the coal, oil and and gas industries, routinely questions and mocks the science of climate change, while Democratic rival Joe Biden is proposing an ambitious $2 trillion plan to wean Americans off fossil fuels to slow global warming.  The Trump administration has rolled back major Obama-era efforts to reduce fossil fuel emissions from cars and trucks and power plants. Many of the administration's environmental and public health rollbacks are likely to wind up before the Supreme Court.  On Tuesday, Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican and another member of the committee considering Barrett's Supreme Court confirmation, also asked Barrett what she thinks about a series of issues, including climate change.  \"I've read about climate change,' Barrett answered.  'And you have some opinions on climate change that you've thought about?' Kennedy asked.  'I'm certainly not a scientist,' Barrett replied, using a frequent refrain of more conservative Republicans on the matter. 'I would not say that I have firm views on it,\"  On Twitter, climate experts and members of past administrations rebuked Barrett for demurring.  \"SORRY, HER VIEWS ON CLIMATE ARE RELEVANT TO ALL LIVING BEINGS,\" wrote Leah Stokes, a climate researcher at the University of California at Santa Barbara.

In total, 140,000, or 39.4 per cent, of plants are threatened, up from an earlier estimate of 21 per cent from four years ago, the organisation says.  Kew's annual State of the World’s Plants and Fungi report brings together expertise of 210 scientists from 42 countries to classify species at risk of extinction, including 723 plants we use for medicine.  The biggest threat to plants is the clearance of natural habitats such as rainforest for agriculture, the experts claim.  Scientists are now in a 'race against time' to find and save new species before they vanish, according to Kew Garden.  Abarema filamentosa (Leguminosae), a vulnerable species from the Atlantic Forest in Brazil  But climate change is catching up and threatening species with rising temperatures and environmental catastrophes such as drought.  Professor Alexandre Antonelli, director of science at RBG Kew, said the new estimate is 'a very worrying picture of risk and urgent need for action'.  'We are also losing the race against time, species are probably disappearing faster than we can find and name,' he said.  'Many of them could hold important clues for solving many of the pressing challenges of medicine and perhaps even some of the emerging or current pandemics.'  New analyses this year show that 39.4 per cent of plants are at risk, meaning estimates have doubled in a mere four years.  St Helena Olive tree (pictured here) is now extinct. It was a plant from the monotypic genus  Accounting for under and over-represented plant groups and geographical areas enabled the scientists to estimate extinction risk more accurately than the 2016 estimate.  More sophisticated conservation assessments and new analytical approaches have also provided researchers with better estimates, Kew said in a statement.  The best course of action now is to ‘fast track’ risk assessments – which could be done with AI – so key areas can be protected and species can be conserved.  AI could potentially detect if an area contains multiple species that haven’t been assessed, but are more likely to be threatened.  'We need to have a rough idea of the conservation status of every species – and we now have ways to achieve that with AI approaches that are up to 90 per cent accurate,' said report co-author Dr Eimear Nic Lughadha at RBG Kew.  'The techniques are good enough to say, \"this area has a lot of species that haven’t been assessed but are almost certainly threatened\".  The only known wild species of Abutilon pitcairnense was wiped off Pitcairn Island after a landslide  'Knowing that will enable us to identify the most important areas to conserve in the immediate future.'  Among those threatened with extinction are 723 species used for medicines, including plants used to treat circulatory disorders, skin diseases and coughs and colds.  Out of the 5,411 medicinal plants that have been assessed for their conservation status, 723, or 13 per cent, are categorised as threatened.  For fungi, only six medicinal species have been assessed, one of which, eburiko (Fomitopsis officinalis), a wood-inhabiting parasitic fungus with antimicrobial properties, has already been pushed to the brink of extinction.  Fomitopsis officinalis, medicinal fungas extinct in Spain. It is widely distributed in the northern Hemisphere  Among these threatened species is Brugmansia sanguinea, a medicinal plant used traditionally for circulatory disorders, which has been listed as ‘extinct in the wild’ by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).  Other medicinal species at risk of extinction include Nepenthes khasiana, traditionally applied for skin diseases, and the black pepper bark tree (Warburgia salutaris), a traditional medicine for coughs and colds.  A rise in the demand for herbal medicines is driven by an increase in prevalence of certain chronic diseases, such as Covid-19, and the search for new therapies.  Brugmansia sanguinea, or the red angel's trumpet, one of the medicinal plants threatened with extinction  Globally, 4 billion people rely on herbal medicines as their primary source of healthcare.  'Scientific advances are providing opportunities for more sustainable ways to reveal new medicines from nature, to harmonise the therapeutic use of biodiversity with its proactive conservation through nature-based solutions,' said co-author Dr Melanie-Jayne Howes.  'These strategies provide hope to safeguard supplies of valuable medicines in the future, while demonstrating the value of plants and fungi as an additional incentive for conserving biodiversity.'  Food security is also threatened according to the report, which is not helped by the fact humanity is 'overly dependent on a tiny fraction of plants and fungi'.  This is despite the thousands of species out there that have the potential to feed and fuel millions around the world.  Future food: Chaya, cnidoscolus aconitifolius, otherwise known as cabbage Star or tree spinach  Fonio, digitaria exilis, an annual tropical grass grown in West Africa for its tiny and husked seeds  Just 15 plants provide 90 per cent of humanity’s food energy intake, and four billion people rely entirely on three crops – rice, maize and wheat.  Relying on a handful of crops to feed the global population has contributed to malnutrition and left humans vulnerable to climate change.  New food sources are also needed to feed a global population anticipated to increase from 7.8 billion to 10 billion by 2050, the experts claim.  'The thousands of underutilised and neglected plant species are the lifeline to millions of people on Earth tormented by unprecedented climate change, pervasive food and nutrition insecurity, and economic disempowerment,' said co-author Dr Stefano Padulosi at Bioversity International.

'The fruits and seeds are eaten by local people, the white pulp is used medicinally to treat fevers and diarrhoea and the bark fibre is used to make paper, rope, and clothing.  'The fruits in the form of powder have already reached the London market, and is used to sprinkle on cereal or yogurt or mixed into smoothies and juices, providing a rich source of vitamin C, fibre and antioxidants.'

Discoveries include new plants related to species that treat inflammation and malaria, wild relatives of spinach, cassava and sweet potato, and eight new species of fungi related to the edible 'old man in the woods' mushroom.  But more funding and research is needed to speed up the identification, naming and conservation of species before they go extinct, experts claim.

Try refreshing your browser, or Poll shows support is slipping for Trans Mountain, raising political risk for Trudeau Back to video  The $4.5-billion purchase of Trans Mountain in 2018 has been a political quagmire for Trudeau, costing him support among his environmentalist base while winning him little favour with voters in Alberta. The poll suggests that even if Trudeau overcomes legal hurdles, the project will remain a dilemma for his government, with opposition escalating largely in strongholds for the Liberal party.  The expansion would almost triple to 890,000 barrels a day the shipping capacity on the line, which travels from Edmonton to a port terminal near Vancouver. The oil industry considers the project key to developing new markets for its crude in Asia and reducing its dependence on U.S. refiners. Environmentalists say the expansion would allow for increased oil sands output, contributing to the threat of catastrophic climate change and preventing Canada from meeting its greenhouse gas reduction commitments.  Trans Mountain won a major battle earlier this month, when the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed a case against the line. But it still faces a court challenge in British Columbia that’s centered on whether Trudeau’s government adequately consulted with indigenous groups along the pipeline route.

(AP) \" Supporters of a regional pact that would tackle transportation emissions are struggling to win over several New England governors concerned that the climate change initiative will increase gas prices.  After the Transportation and Climate Initiative was announced last month, New Hampshire's Republican Gov. Chris Sununu said the state won't join, citing fears of a gas price hike. Vermont's Republican Gov. Phil Scott said he couldn't support the initiative if it amounts to a tax on carbon. A spokesman for Maine's Democratic Gov. Janet Mills said states like Maine have unique transportation issues and will be 'appropriately cautious.'  The initiative is aimed at a dozen Northeast and mid-Atlantic states and would take effect in 2022. It would address pollution from transportation \" which represents 40% of greenhouse gas emissions in the region, the largest source of emissions. The area has tens of millions of registered vehicles.  New Jersey has not committed to implementing the initiative while a spokesman for Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont said his administration was still examining it. Virginia is also reviewing the draft memorandum.  'I am happy to see that other Governors are following my lead in rightfully sounding the alarm on this new gas tax,\" Sununu said in a statement. \"New Hampshire is proof that the best environmental stewardship can be achieved without massive tax schemes.'  Many of the states are already part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which covers 10 states in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic and targets emissions from the power sector.  Under the Transportation and Climate Initiative, wholesale fuel companies would be required to purchase pollution allowances at auction. The sale of those allowances could generate billions for states to invest in carbon-reducing transportation options \" like electric buses, electric car charging stations, bike lanes and sidewalks.  The initiative could lead to emissions reductions in the region by as much as 25% by 2032. But the opposition appears be around a potential gas price hike. If fuel companies pass the cost of the allowances onto consumers, the price of gas in the region could climb by five cents to 17 cents per gallon in 2022, when the pact would take effect.  Among the pact's opponents is Americans for Prosperity, the advocacy group founded by the billionaire Koch brothers. The group's New Hampshire chapter came out against the TCI the same day as Sununu, calling the initiative a top-down government mandate that would \"punish hardworking Granite Staters.'  Supporters of the initiative said the fears over gas prices are overblown and ignore the agreement's potential benefits.  'Personally I think this is political grandstanding,\" said Timmons Roberts, a professor of environmental studies at Brown University. 'This is the incremental change, it would be over 12 years. This is just using a well-meaning effort as a whipping boy.'  But Roberts and others acknowledge that the pact needs to address the concerns of low-income and working families who must drive long distances for work or school.  'Some people positively opt into this lifestyle, but many don't. They live where they live because of family, lack of economic mobility, or other factors,' said Jason Veysey, the deputy director for the Stockholm Environment Institute's energy modeling program.  'People who have to drive may be negatively affected by an increase in fuel prices,\" he said. \"However, it's worth underlining that TCI is supposed to be a cap-and-dividend program, in which higher costs for the most vulnerable are mitigated by the dividends.'  The pact has been praised by many of the region's business, health and environmental leaders, including Massachusetts Republican Gov. Charlie Baker. He touted the pact in his State of the Commonwealth address last week as part of his plan for the state to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.  Other governors also appear supportive.  J.J. Abbott, press secretary for Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, said the state was 'committed to being a part of the TCI conversations,' but would make no decision on joining 'until the program is fully designed.\" Josh Block, a spokesman for Rhode Island's Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo, said she is 'fully committed to the goals of the Transportation Climate Initiative,' but that the specific statutory and regulatory changes needed to meet those goals \"will be the source of public discussion and input over the coming year.\"  Jordan Stutt, the carbon programs director of the Acadia Center, an environmental research and advocacy nonprofit, said states understand the need to address transport emissions. The initiative could also help improve air quality, boost economies and improve transport, especially in rural areas, he said.  According to information on the TCI website, modeling has showing public health benefits of as much as $10 billion annually by 2032, including over 1,000 fewer premature deaths. It would also generate up to $7 billion annually that could be invested into expanding transport choices for rural, urban and suburban communities.  'Without any viable alternative to this program, the states will not be able to achieve their climate goals,' Stutt said.   ___  Associated Press writers David Sharp in Maine, Wilson Ring in Vermont, Michael Catalini in New Jersey, Mark Scolforo in Pennsylvania and Susan Haigh in Connecticut contributed to this report.

Climate-connected disasters seem everywhere in the crazy year 2020. But scientists Wednesday, Sept. 9, say it'll get worse. (AP Photo/Noah Berger, File)  A record amount of California is burning, spurred by a nearly 20-year mega-drought. To the north, parts of Oregon that don’t usually catch fire are in flames.  Meanwhile, the Atlantic’s 16th and 17th named tropical storms are swirling, a record number for this time of year. Powerful Typhoon Haishen lashed Japan and the Korean Peninsula this week. Last month it hit 130 degrees in Death Valley, the hottest Earth has been in nearly a century.  Phoenix keeps setting triple-digit heat records, while Colorado went through a weather whiplash of 90-degree heat to snow this week. Siberia, famous for its icy climate, hit 100 degrees earlier this year, accompanied by wildfires. Before that Australia and the Amazon were in flames.  Amid all that, Iowa's derecho — bizarre straight-line winds that got as powerful as a major hurricane, causing billions of dollars in damages — barely went noticed.  Freak natural disasters — most with what scientists say likely have a climate change connection — seem to be everywhere in the crazy year 2020. But experts say we’ll probably look back and say those were the good old days, when disasters weren’t so wild.  “It’s going to get A LOT worse,” Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb said Wednesday. “I say that with emphasis because it does challenge the imagination. And that’s the scary thing to know as a climate scientist in 2020.”  Colorado University environmental sciences chief Waleed Abdalati, NASA’s former chief scientist, said the trajectory of worsening disasters and climate change from the burning of coal, oil and gas is clear, and basic physics.  “I strongly believe we’re going to look back in 10 years, certainly 20 and definitely 50 and say, ‘Wow, 2020 was a crazy year, but I miss it,’” Abdalati said.  That’s because what's happening now is just the type of crazy climate scientists anticipated 10 or 20 years ago.  “It seems like this is what we always were talking about a decade ago,” said North Carolina State climatologist Kathie Dello.  Even so, Cobb said the sheer magnitude of what’s happening now was hard to fathom back then. Just as the future of climate disasters is hard to fathom now.  “A year like 2020 could have been the subject of a marvelous science fiction film in 2000,” Cobb said. “Now we have to watch and digest real-time disaster after disaster after disaster, on top of a pandemic. The outlook could not be any more grim. It’s just a horrifying prospect.”  “The 2030s are going to be noticeably worse than the 2020s,” she said.  University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck, a climate scientist, said that in 30 years because of the climate change already baked into the atmosphere “we’re pretty much guaranteed that we’ll have double what we have now.”  Expect stronger winds, more drought, more heavy downpours and floods, Abdalati said.  “The kind of things we’re seeing are no surprise to the (scientific) community that understands the rules and the laws of physics,” Abdalati said.  “A lot of people want to blame it on 2020, but 2020 didn’t do this,” Dello said. “We know the behavior that caused climate change.”  Consider the world’s environment like an engine: “We have injected more energy into the system because we have trapped more heat into the atmosphere,” said World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.  That means more energy for tropical storms as well as changes to rainfall patterns that bring drought to some places and heavy rainfall to others, Taalas said.  In California, where more than 2.3 million acres have burned, the fires are spurred by climate change drying plants and trees that then go up in flames, said University of Colorado fire scientist Jennifer Balch. California is in the midst of a nearly 20-year mega-drought, the first of its kind in the United States since Europeans arrived, Overpeck said.  Scientists also make direct connections between heat waves and climate change.  Some disasters at the moment can’t be directly linked to man-made warming, such as the derecho, Overpeck said. But looking at the big picture over time shows the problem, and it’s one that comes down to the basic physics of trapped heat energy.  “I am not an alarmist. I don’t want to scare people,” Abdalati said. “It’s a problem with tremendous consequences and it’s too important not to get right.”  And so even though the climate will likely get worse, Overpeck is also optimistic about what future generations will think when they look back at the wild and dangerous weather of 2020.  “I think we’ll look back and we’ll see a whole bunch of increasingly crazy years,” Overpeck said. “And that this year, in 2020, I hope we look back and say it got crazy enough that it motivated us to act on climate change in the United States.”   ___  Associated Press writer Gillian Flaccus contributed from Portland, Oregon.   ___  Follow AP’s climate coverage here.

(AP Photo/Morry Gash, Pool)  WASHINGTON – The Latest on the 2020 presidential election (all times local):   10:50 p.m.  President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden are painting a very different picture of the reliability of the upcoming election.  Biden urged voters to cast their ballots and not be intimidated by Trump’s suggestions he might not accept a loss. Trump has been groundlessly casting doubt on the reliability of mail ballots and elections in general.  “Vote whatever way is the best way for you,” Biden said. “Because he will not be able to stop you from determining the outcome of this election.”  Biden agreed not to declare victory before the ballots are counted and to accept voters’ verdicts.  Trump continued to spread falsehoods about mail voting. He said falsely that his campaign's poll watchers were improperly turned away at a Philadelphia early voting site Tuesday -- the poll watchers had not yet been accredited to observe. He suggested widespread Democratic fraud because a handful of ballots were improperly thrown in the trash last week -- but didn’t mention it occurred in a Republican-controlled elections office and was quickly reported to authorities.  Biden urged viewers not to worry about Trump’s scare tactics.  “I will accept it, and he will, too. You know why?” Biden said. “Because once the winner is declared once all the ballots are counted, that’ll be the end of it.\"   ___  HERE’S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT WHAT’S HAPPENING IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE:  The first presidential debate between President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden begins at 9 p.m. Eastern time in Cleveland.

Beau Biden died of cancer in 2015.  Trump responded by pivoting to a familiar attack, on Biden’s other son, Hunter.  The president said, “I don’t know Beau. I know Hunter,” and accused Hunter Biden of having collected millions of dollars from oversees interests, including China, while working as a consultant during his father’s tenure as vice president. It echoed attacks the president made earlier in the debate in Cleveland, but have little basis in fact.  Trump also opened a new line of attack when he said Hunter Biden was dishonorably discharged from the military for cocaine use. Biden responded that his son wasn’t dishonorably discharged.  He addressed viewers directly and said that, like a lot of Americans, Hunter had a drug problem but was “working on it” and had “fixed it.”  Biden added, “I’m proud of my son.”   ___   10:25 p.m.  President Donald Trump says he does see human beings as contributing somewhat to climate change but doesn’t support strict regulations in part because of negative ramifications for business.  When asked at Tuesday's debate about humans being partially to blame for environmental deterioration, Trump said, “to an extent, yes.”  But when asked why he took steps like withdrawing the U.S. from the landmark Paris climate pact, Trump reiterated his argument that such agreements were “driving energy prices through the sky.”  Nearly 200 nations signed the climate deal in which each country provides its own goals to curb emissions of heat-trapping gases that lead to climate change.  Biden said he would champion job-creating programs that embrace green technologies and would rejoin the Paris accord, which is “all falling apart” without U.S. involvement.   ___   10:20 p.m.  President Donald Trump has sidestepped a question from moderator Chris Wallace about whether he was willing to condemn white supremacists and militia groups.  “I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing, not the right wing,” Trump responded. “I’m willing to do anything. I want to see peace.”  When pressed further, Trump said, “What do you want to call them? Give me a name. Give me a name?”  Finally, he said, “Proud Boys — Stand back, stand by, but I’ll tell you what, somebody’s got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not right-wing problem..... This is a left wing problem.”  Antifa followers have appeared at anti-racism protests, but there’s been little evidence behind Republican claims that antifa members are to blame for the violence at such protests.  Trump infamously said there were good people “on both sides” after a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that led to the death of a counterprotester.   ___   10:15 p.m.  President Donald Trump and Vice President Joe Biden are making their pitches to win over Black voters in the coming election, with Biden mockingly questioning: “This man, this man is a savior of African Americans? This man has done virtually nothing.”  Biden says that 1 in 1,000 African Americans has died because of the coronavirus, and if Trump doesn’t do something quickly, it will be 1 in 500.  Trump turned the discussion from COVID-19 to a crime bill passed in 1994 that Biden helped write and get passed that, among other things, increased the penalties for certain drug offenses.  Trump says “I’m letting people out of jail now,” and asserted that Biden had treated the Black community “about as bad as anybody in this country.”   ___   10:10 p.m.  President Donald Trump and Joe Biden are trading barbs about each other’s relatives.  While Biden was making a point during the first presidential debate in Cleveland about the Trump administration’s trade deals with China not having the desired effect, Trump jumped in. He resurrected past claims about the former vice president’s son Hunter working overseas.  Trump said Hunter Biden reaped millions in ill-gotten profit from China and other overseas interests, accusations that have been repeatedly debunked. Biden shot back, “None of that is true.” He then added of Trump, “His family, we could talk all night.”  Trump interrupted to respond that his children gave up lucrative jobs to join government and “help people,” which left moderator Chris Wallace pleading, “Mr. President, please stop” trying to restore order on the stage.  Biden then turned to the camera and addressed the audience directly, something he did frequently Tuesday night. “This is not about my family or his family,” Biden said. “It’s about your family.”   ___   10:05 p.m.  President Donald Trump won’t say when he will finally make his personal taxes public as he has long promised.  During the first presidential debate Tuesday, Trump was asked specifically about a report in The New York Times that revealed he paid only $750 in personal income taxes each of those years.  All presidents except Trump have publicly released their taxes since the presidency of Richard Nixon.  Trump has said since 2016 that he would eventually release them. But when asked by moderator Chris Wallace when, he said only: “You’ll get to see it.”  Democratic nominee Joe Biden quickly used that as a point of attack, saying Trump “does take advantage of the tax code” and “pays less tax than a schoolteacher.”  Trump shrugged off the attack, saying that all business leaders do the same “unless they are stupid.”   ___   10 p.m.  President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden are showcasing vastly different approaches during their first presidential debate in Cleveland.  Trump is being aggressive toward Biden on Tuesday, interrupting the former vice president and repeatedly being admonished by debate moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News to stick to the rules that both campaigns had agreed to.  Biden is taking a more personal approach. At several times during the debate, Biden addressed his comments to “you folks at home” watching on television as he looked straight into the camera.   ___   9:50 p.m.  President Donald Trump says he’s had “no negative effect” from massive campaign rallies with thousands of attendees not adhering to social distancing recommendations amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.  Trump said during Tuesday night’s debate against Democrat Joe Biden that he thought masks “are OK,” pulling one out from his pocket and saying, “I wear masks when needed.”  But Trump also bragged that he’s drawn “35 to 40,000 people” at his campaign rallies, saying he brings such large crowds to outdoor events “because people want to hear what I have to say.” Trump portrayed Biden’s socially distanced events as insignificant affairs where the Democrat “has three people some place.”  Former Republican presidential hopeful Herman Cain, who attended one of Trump’s rallies in June without wearing a mask or social distancing, tested positive for the coronavirus nine days after the rally and died a month later. Neither Trump nor Biden mentioned him.  Biden has held smaller campaign events, requiring attendees to spread out and at times sit in taped-off circles. Calling Trump “totally irresponsible” on managing COVID-19, Biden said the president is “a fool on this” and said Trump only worried about masks in the interest of protecting his own health, not others.   ___   9:35 p.m.  The first presidential debate between President Donald Trump and Joe Biden has gotten off to an contentious start, breaking down after just a few moments with Trump interrupting Biden on several occasions and Biden calling the president a clown and a liar.  As the discussion about the Supreme Court quickly turned to COVID-19, Trump claimed without evidence that 2 million people would have died if Biden were president.  Moderator Chris Wallace pleaded with Trump, stating that COVID-19 would be discussed later in the day. He then asked Trump about whether he had a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, and the president said, “First of all, I guess I’m debating you, not him, but that’s OK. I’m not surprised.”  Biden laughed at Trump’s jabs. But he also appeared to get upset at times, too.  “Here’s the deal, the fact is that everything he’s saying so far is simply a lie,” Biden said. “I’m not here to call out his lies. Everybody knows he’s a liar.”  Wallace asked Trump to let Biden finish. “Folks do you have any idea what this clown is doing?” Biden said.   ___   9:25 p.m.  Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden says he is the leader of his party.  Biden made the comment during Tuesday night’s debate after President Donald Trump accused him of supporting abolishing private insurance.  Biden noted that he won the Democratic nomination partly by arguing against single-payer health care that many of his rivals sought. The former vice president has instead proposed expanding the Affordable Care Act to provide a public option that people could buy into.  Trump responded that Democrats still want to abolish private health insurance and suggested the party would force Biden to do its bidding.  “My party is me,” Biden replied. “Right now, I’m the Democratic Party.”   ___   9:20 p.m.  The first face-off for President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden is coming over a clash concerning a president’s prerogative to put push through an election-year Supreme Court nominee.  Trump says during a debate Tuesday night in Cleveland that Republicans “won the election and therefore we have the right to choose” Amy Coney Barrett as a replacement for the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  Trump added that he felt Democrats “wouldn’t even think about not doing it” if given the chance to nominate a justice with just weeks until the election.  Biden and other Democrats have decried Trump’s nomination of a new justice given Republicans’ refusal to consider President Barack Obama’s selection following the 2016 death of Antonin Scalia. Biden didn’t mention that during the debate, however.  Biden says that Barrett seems like “a very fine person” but that her nomination after “tens of thousands of people have already voted” was troubling.   ___   9 p.m.  President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden are face-to-face in their first presidential debate, the most pivotal moment so far in an election that turns on a historic pandemic, racial unrest and an economy in shambles.  The two are meeting Tuesday night in Cleveland. It’s a key opportunity for Trump to improve his standing in a race that polls show has remained stubbornly unchanged. For Biden, the debate offers a chance to show the steadiness he says the nation needs in contrast to Trump’s divisiveness.  Biden welcomed Trump to the stage, saying, “How you doing, man?”  The topics are the records of the candidates, the Supreme Court, the coronavirus pandemic, the economy, “race and violence in our cities,” and election integrity.  At issue is the coronavirus pandemic that has killed 205,000 Americans and cost the country millions of jobs. Early voting is underway in many states, with the election 35 days away.   ___   5:50 p.m.  Kamala Harris says her running mate, Joe Biden, will share his vision for tackling the coronavirus and rebuilding the nation’s economy during his presidential debate against President Donald Trump.  The Democratic California senator said Tuesday during a digital fundraiser with artists that “Joe’s goal in the debate is to communicate directly with the American people.”  Harris says the country is at a crossroads in more ways than one, from the pandemic and economic recession to a reckoning on racial injustice and climate change. She’s calling Republican efforts to fill a Supreme Court seat before the election a “crisis.”  Harris says, “And in the midst of all this, a president whose instinct is to always stoke chaos, division, and mistrust.”  Harris is set to debate Vice President Mike Pence next week.   ___   2:15 p.m.  Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his wife, Jill Biden, have released more of their personal tax returns ahead of the first presidential debate.  The Bidens’ returns show the couple paid almost $300,000 in federal taxes in 2019, including almost $288,000 in personal income tax. The Bidens reported taxable income of $944,737.  The release on Tuesday comes just days after The New York Times reported that Trump paid $750 in federal income taxes in 2016, the year he was elected president, and again in 2017, his first year in office. The Times said Trump paid no federal income taxes for 10 of the 15 years before that.  Biden and Trump are set to meet Tuesday night in Cleveland for their first presidential debate, and Trump’s taxes are sure to come up.  Trump has called the reports “fake news” yet still refuses to release his returns himself. Biden already had released two decades’ worth of his tax returns, in addition to the federal financial disclosures required of him when he was a senator and vice president.  Biden’s running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, and her husband, Doug Emhoff, also released their 2019 returns Tuesday. Harris and Emhoff reported paying $1.05 million in personal income taxes and $1.19 million in total federal taxes on $3.02 million in taxable income.   ___   2:10 p.m.  President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump emerged from the White House to a crowd of more than 100 cheering supporters as they departed for the first presidential debate in Cleveland.  The crowd, which included staffers and interns, cheered as the Trumps left the White House.  Both the president and first lady paused to recognize the show of support with a few claps of their own and several first pumps from Trump.  Trump boarded Marine One without comment. At Joint Base Andrews, where Air Force One was set to take off, Trump gave a wave and thumbs before boarding.   ___   12:30 p.m.  President Donald Trump spent Tuesday morning in informal preparations for the first debate with Joe Biden. A longer, more formal preparation session was set for the afternoon once he arrives in Cleveland.  Trump’s prep team includes former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, campaign communications strategist Jason Miller, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Jared Kushner, press secretary Kayleigh McEnany and communications director Alyssa Farah. Some other advisers like Dan Scavino and Hope Hicks have also been involved.  While Trump is itching to go on the offense against Biden, some aides have encouraged him to adopt a more measured tone -- believing that in many ways the debates are more about Trump vs himself than Biden. Trump, they argue, should focus more on selling his accomplishments than trying to viciously attack Biden. Some involved with the preparations, though, have encouraged Trump’s more aggressive ‘counterpunching’ side.

REUTERS/Ahmed Yosri  RIYADH (Reuters) - Finance officials from the world’s 20 biggest economies (G20) meeting in Riyadh on Sunday reached agreement on the wording of a final communique that includes for the first time a reference to climate change, G20 diplomatic sources said.  Compromise language hammered out to overcome U.S. objections retained a reference to the Financial Stability Board’s work examining the implications of climate change for financial stability, although it dropped climate change from its list of downside risks to global economic growth.  One of the sources said it was the first time a reference to climate change had been included in a G20 finance communique, even though it was removed from the top of the joint statement.  G20 finance ministers and central bankers are meeting in the Saudi capital to discuss top global economic challenges, including the spread of the new coronavirus.  Concerns about the economic impact of climate change have escalated in recent years and pressure is mounting on business to accelerate the shift to a low-carbon economy ahead of United Nations climate talks in November.  A report issued last week forecast the world’s financial services sector risks losses of up to $1 trillion if it fails to respond quickly to climate change and is hit by policy shifts such as the introduction of a carbon tax.   HIGHLY FRAGILE  The International Monetary Fund included climate-related disasters in a list of risks that could derail a “highly fragile” projected recovery in the global economy in 2020. It estimated that a typical climate-related natural disaster reduced growth by an average of 0.4 percentage points in the affected country the year it occurred.  “We should not hide away from what is going on. The climate crisis is upon us,” IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva told a conference in Riyadh on Friday on the eve of the G20 talks.  U.S. officials have resisted naming climate change as an economic risk since President Donald Trump was elected in 2016. One of Trump’s first acts in office was to announce Washington’s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.  G20 officials completed work on the communique on Sunday morning, the sources said. The final wording was not immediately available.  Delegates worked out a compromise after Washington objected to the initial proposed language, which had included “macroeconomic risk related to environmental stability” in a list of downside risks to global growth, two G20 diplomatic sources said.  A third source said the document would include no reference to fighting climate change, focusing instead on the risks emanating from such shifts.  “In the end it’s not in the first paragraph but in the ninth, very discreet and indirect, but still the first time the word finds its way into a communiqué since this U.S. administration,” the source said.  The communique forecasts a modest pick-up in global growth this year and next, but cites downside risks to this outlook stemming from geopolitical and remaining trade tensions and policy uncertainty.

This may very well be the most radical, politically incorrect book that you will read this year — or perhaps that you have ever read. Against the Left: A Ro... Llewellyn H Rockwell Jr Best Price: $13.57 Buy New $8.00 (as of 10:15 EST - Details)  Llewellyn “Lew” Rockwell is a noted libertarian writer, prolific blogger, astute political commentator, and articulate speaker; the founder and chairman of the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama; the founder and editor of the daily news and opinion site LewRockwell.com; and the former congressional chief of staff to Ron Paul, the perennial taxpayers’ friend when he was in the U.S. House of Representatives.  Against the Left is a small but powerful book. It contains a brief introduction and conclusion and six chapters, titled “The Assault on the Family,” “‘Civil Rights’ and Disabilities,” “Immigration,” “Environmentalism,” “Economic Egalitarianism,” and “Left Libertarianism.” The book’s lengthy preface is written by Hans-Hermann Hoppe, the noted economist and political theorist. There are no footnotes or bibliography, but Against the Left is written for a general audience, and important books for further reading are recommended throughout. The book does, however, include an index. Much of the content in each of the book’s chapters has been taken from previously published articles. This content has, for the most part, been seamlessly integrated. The insights of the economists and political theorists Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard are “basic” to the book, and Rockwell quotes them often.  The longest chapter in Against the Left is the first one, on the assault on the family. This comes as no surprise since “a central theme” of the book “is the importance of the traditional family for preserving our liberty and civilization.” Rockwell maintains that “the modern assault on the family stems from socialism.” Although he is a libertarian, Rockwell is also unapologetically a traditionalist: “In order to maintain a free society, it is essential that the traditional family, i.e., the union of one man and one woman in marriage, in most cases to raise a family, be preserved.” He believes that “the fundamental threat to liberty comes from leftist programs to promote absolute equality.” He explains how “legal equality doesn’t abolish biological differences.” The “failure of all leftists” is “ignoring this point.” In this chapter, Rockwell takes on same-sex “marriage,” homosexuals in the military, feminism, and the canard that women earn less on average than men.  In chapter two, Rockwell discusses discrimination, civil “rights,” racism, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the G.I. bill, and “the greatest of all sacred cows: the Brown decision.” He maintains that “discrimination law limits the freedom of property owners to use their money as they see fit.” He explains how “in the name of proving that you are not discriminating against a particular group, your only protection is to discriminate in favor of that group.” Rockwell considers “the implied assumption” behind discrimination laws to be “the idea that judges and bureaucrats can discover the real motivation behind every hiring, firing, or labor-management decision.” In a free society, “Employers can hire or fire for any reason they want.” They “can be biased, bigoted, or have poor judgment,” but it is their “judgment to make.” Rockwell believes that “the extent of racism in American society is exaggerated.” The state uses the “racism racket” to silence its critics and to justify “its further extension of power over education, employment, wealth redistribution, and a good deal else.” Rockwell also explains how the state is really saying to the disabled: “Your lack of ability in a particular area entitles you to the property of others.”  Chapter three is devoted to a controversial subject among libertarians: immigration. Rockwell believes it is impossible that “the US or Europe will be a freer place after several more decades of uninterrupted mass immigration.” He explains why the “free immigration” position is not analogous to free trade, “as some libertarians have erroneously claimed.” His solution to the immigration problem is the “total privatization” of everything. With all property privately owned, immigration “would be up to each individual property owner.” In the meantime, because right now “immigration decisions are made by a central authority, with the wishes of property owners completely disregarded,” the correct way to proceed “is to decentralize decision-making on immigration to the lowest possible level, so that we approach ever [more] closely the proper libertarian position, in which individual property owners consent to the various movements of peoples.”  The fourth chapter, on environmentalism, is the most radical one in the book. Rockwell doesn’t recycle or conserve “except when it pays to do so.” He prefers air conditioning, the bug-free indoors, and development over swamps, wetlands, and jungles. The intelligence of dolphins, apes, and bees “doesn’t give them rights” over humans. “Their only real value comes from what they can do for man.” His “favorite section of the hardware store features bug killers, weed killers, varmint traps, and poisons of all sorts.” Nature must be tamed, cut, curbed, and controlled for the benefit of mankind. Swamps “should be drained” and rain forests “turned over to productive agriculture.” Rockwell opposes “world central planning in order to control the climate and protect the holy earth from the effects of industrialization,” even as he defends high civilization, capitalism, property rights, and markets.  In this chapter, Rockwell also tackles the subject of government food regulations — “another area dear to the heart of environmentalists.” He explains that “when people say government should do x, y, and z, they are really saying that these people” — a “class of mealy-mouthed, grasping special interests all fired up about what they will do with your money once they get or retain power” — “should be given power to appoint other people to permanent positions of power to tell you and yours what they can and cannot do with their lives and property, and to take a rake-off for their trouble.” Here Rockwell asks a legitimate question for leftists: “Do we owe our health and safety to government regulations or to the responsiveness of the well-capitalized market economy to our preferences and needs?” He explains that most people “are all too willing to credit government for all that is good in the world, and equally prone to overlook market freedom as a source of all that we call civilizational progress.” Rockwell concludes: “The state from the ancient world to the present has created nothing. It has only taken. The market, on the other hand, delivers more miracles every day than we can count.”  Rockwell takes on the nebulous term equality in the fifth chapter. Proponents of equality “make precious little effort to disclose to us precisely what they have in mind.” He believes that the “obsession” with equality “undermines every indicator of health we might look for in a civilization.” It is in the course of working toward equality that “the state expands its power at the expense of other forms of human association, including the family itself.” Rockwell believes in the ability of the market “to incorporate just about anyone into the division of labor.” And “even if one person is better than another at absolutely everything, the less able person can still flourish in a free market.” In this chapter, Rockwell also explains how “the struggle for liberty” should not be confused with feminism, and mocks the idea that the use of traditional English pronouns is “oppressive to people who do not identify with the gender they were ‘assigned at birth.’”  The last chapter, on left libertarianism, is the shortest in the book, but an important one for libertarians. Here Rockwell explains how leftism has made inroads into certain elements of libertarianism. He views “infighting” — which is not unique to libertarianism — as helpful. After all, “a respectful exchange of ideas is how a school of thought develops.” He is opposed to “thick” libertarians — tainted by leftist ideas about social justice and egalitarianism — who seek to transform the “elegant moral and social system” of libertarianism by adding to its foundational principle of nonaggression and its resolute commitment to property rights.  Against the Left is a great introduction to the evils of leftism and the ideas of Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard.  Against the Left: A Rothbardian Libertarianism, by Llewellyn H.

This year? \"Our house is still on fire,\" she declared, adding that \"your inaction is fueling the flames by the hour.\" At one point, the 17-year-old climate activist dismissed a question posed to her on a panel about how she handles criticism as frivolous. \"I would like to say something that I think people need to know more than how I deal with haters,\" she said, before citing stats from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

That doesn't mean he won't vote for Joe Biden.  \"I'll knock doors in a Bernie (Sanders) shirt for (Biden), to show people that our movement is still here, but that we believe in moving beyond this last four years,\" Tafoya said.  Tafoya, a 34-year-old climate activist from Denver, supported both of Sanders' presidential runs. He said it was \"heartbreaking\" when Sanders dropped out of the race in early April; he received numerous calls from his friends, crying.  And while Tafoya believes progressives who supported Sanders still need time to grieve and heal, he recognizes it would far easier to pass progressive policies under a Democratic administration than a Republican one.  \"Ultimately, it seems like we can get more progress through the initiatives that we ... care about through Biden than Trump,\" Tafoya said.  Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, is going to need young voters, many who identify as progressive and had supported Sanders' campaign, to win the 2020 presidential election. While young voters made up roughly 27% of voters in 2016, they are seen as essential for campaigns and are often relied on for the critical grassroots work of knocking on doors and activating voters.  The Biden campaign recently announced working groups focused on several issues of particular importance to progressive voters, one of which will be chaired by progressive icon Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Biden, who has been endorsed by Sanders, also has rolled out policy initiatives aimed at wooing progressive voters, including expanding government-funded health insurance through Medicare to people 60 and older and a debt forgiveness plan focused on students in low- and middle-income households.  But Biden will have to balance courting progressives voters with maintaining his appeal to moderate voters in swing states, many of whom abandoned Hillary Clinton in 2016 but might not want to vote for Donald Trump again. The former vice president built much of his primary campaign around appealing to a broad swath of voters.  \"Americans aren't looking for revolution,\" Biden told the \"TODAY\" show in late February, days before the South Carolina primary victory that revived his campaign. \"They're looking for progress. They're looking for, 'Tell me how you're going to help me with my health care. Tell me you'll make me safer.' \"  While Biden is making inroads with top progressive groups, several leaders noted they still want to know more about Biden's plans for incorporating progressives values into his agenda.  \"We think it is important that if vice president Biden wants to win the youth vote, he has to move on the issues, so that when young people are looking at candidates and looking at the different differences between the candidates on the issue, that they can get more excited that they see candidates that are actually championing what they care for,\" said Sarah Audelo, executive director of Alliance for Youth Action.  Working groups bring Biden, Sanders supporters together  Since Sanders dropped out of the Democratic race, progressive groups and the Biden campaign have created a dialogue. Last week's announcement on the working groups was in part the fruit of that labor.  In the days after Sanders left the race, the Sunrise Movement, which focuses on climate change, along with six other progressive groups focused on issues like gun control, immigration and foreign policy urged Biden in an open letter to adopt a litany of progressive stances on key issues.  They asked Biden to commit to a $10 trillion Green New Deal stimulus package, legalization of marijuana, implementing a \"wealth tax\" and a plan to reduce gun deaths by 50% in ten years. Audelo said the issues the groups laid out are all important policies for young progressives and that Biden moving on these issues could create excitement for those voters.  \"It is incumbent on the Biden campaign to hear the expertise that folks have and really follow their guidance in terms of policy change,\" Audelo said of the progressives who are a part of the policy working groups. \"So that way, a lot of folks can be seen as surrogates hopefully for the campaign. They are the validators that the campaign really needs.\"  After the letter was sent, Biden and Sanders worked to create the policy working groups that would address several issues that are particularly important to young progressives. The groups will be focused on the economy, education, criminal justice, immigration and climate change.  The working groups include allies of both Biden and Sanders.  Reps. Ocasio-Cortez and Pramila Jayapal of Washington, who have both said they are voting for Biden but previously endorsed Sanders, are each co-chairs of a group. (Jayapal also is the co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.) And Varshini Prakash, co-founder and executive director of the Sunrise Movement, Maggie Thompson, former executive director of Generation Progress, and Marisa Franco, director of the Latinx group Mijente, are among several key progressive voices that will participate.  The policy groups will meet ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August to make recommendations for the Democratic National Committee platform and to Biden.  The coalition of progressive groups who had previously written the letter to Biden called the appointments a \"major win for youth organizations that are building political power for young people across the country.\"  \"We hope the Biden team will continue to listen to and consult with youth leaders and our demands as it advances its campaign, and makes actual appointments to its transition team and Administration,\" the coalition said in a statement this week. \"We need to see continued commitments from them and the DNC to promote the solutions that galvanize our generation and give us hope in the political process. Today, we are one step closer.\"  Matt Hill, deputy national press secretary for the Biden campaign, said in statement that \"progressive voters are a key part of our growing coalition to defeat Trump and enact bold change that will tackle the most pressing issues Americans face right now, including rebuilding our economy after the crisis, expanding health care, making college affordable, and more.\"  The Biden campaign is still coordinating with some progressive groups, like the Sunrise Movement, March for Our Lives and United We Dream, beyond the policy working groups. On Biden's campaign, senior adviser Symone Sanders, who served on Sanders' 2016 campaign, along with senior adviser Cristóbal Alex and policy director Stef Feldman have spearheaded engagement with outside progressive groups.  The campaign is focusing on engaging two types of progressive organizations: Traditional groups with progressive ideology, like Planned Parenthood and the Human Rights Campaign, and new-wave progressive groups, like the Sunrise Movement and March for Our Lives, that attract younger and more diverse voters.  The Biden campaign also recently was endorsed by the Progressive Turnout Project, which says it will the invest $52.5 million to knock on more than 10.5 million doors in 17 presidential and Senate battleground states this year.  Ben Wessel, director of NextGen Rising, said Biden's updated plans to expand Medicare and forgive some student debt is helpful to get progressives on board with his campaign.  \"That's a real show of empathy to our young people that they feel like they're not getting from their leaders, where everyone feels like they're being strung out to dry,\" Wessel said. \"So having someone say that they've got your back on this, even if it's small, I think is a good thing.\"  Biden has been criticized by some on the left over his vote for the Iraq War and for his previous stance supporting the Hyde Amendment, a long-standing law that blocks federal funding for abortion in most cases. Biden last summer said he no longer supports the amendment.  A recent USA TODAY/Suffolk poll showed that the vast majority of Sanders supporters (77%) said they will vote for Biden in the general election. But nearly 1 in 4 Sanders supporters (22%) said they would vote for a third party candidate, vote for President Donald Trump, not vote in November or were undecided about who to vote for, according to the poll.  Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University, said Biden could have a hard time getting enthusiastic support from former Sanders supporters due to his lengthy record – three decades of Senate votes and two terms in the White House as President Barack Obama's vice president.  Reeher said it's \"not gonna rub a lot of these Bernie Sanders supporters particularly in the right way,\" with how Biden has portrayed his own record.  \"That's a tougher argument he's making because there's a record there that's sometimes at odds with that narrative of him,\" Reeher said.  The allegation from Tara Reade that she was sexually assaulted by Biden while working for his Senate office has also brought additional scrutiny from progressive voters. Biden has emphatically denied the allegation, saying it \"never happened.\"  Almost half – 45% – of voters between the age of 18- to 34-years old believe Reade's allegation is true, according to a Monmouth University poll published last week.  Several progressive leaders have said that they appreciate Biden not attacking Reade's character, but there is also concern that there needs to be accountability.  \"Right now we're kind of stuck in it he-said, she-said situation,\" said Evan Weber, political director for Sunrise Movement. \"We really don't have a system that is designed to deal with these claims and deliver real justice for survivors and center their feeling in the process.\"  But Wessel noted that in a focus group NextGen Rising conducted several weeks ago, voters said the allegation didn't disqualify Biden, and they wanted to see him address it. Since then, Biden has addressed the allegation in interviews.  \"We've seen Biden do what I don't think too many of our young progressives would expect ... a typical politician to do, which is he went on TV, directed his comments to the American people, and was really honest and open about it,\" Wessel said. \"I actually think that's what voters want to see, that's what our people want to hear. They don't want someone to sweep things under the rug.\"  'Bernie isn’t the hero, the ideas are'  One leader in the coalition of groups that sent Biden the letter last month did express some dissatisfaction in not being contacted individually by the campaign.  Emily Mayer, political director for IfNotNow Movement, said the organization is disappointed there is not a working group focused on foreign policy and the group was not contacted by the campaign.  The IfNotNow Movement endorsed Sanders in the 2020 election, and Mayer said the organization and Sanders' campaign were in \"very frequent conversation.\"  \"We've seen what a disaster Trump has been for American foreign policy,\" Murray said. \"I would hope that Joe Biden and the people around him are going to put forward a progressive vision for how to not only restore the place America has in the world but actually to make American foreign policy the sort of just instrument it should be.\"  Aaron Walker, 26, said right now, he doesn't think he is going to vote for Biden in November. Walker lives in Chicago and noted Illinois \"has virtually no chance of going to Trump.\" He said he's going to focus on supporting \"local leftists and oust any centrist Democrats being challenged by them.\"  Walker, who previously supported Sanders, noted that the movement is more than just the man.  \"I love and respect the man, but the American left isn’t a cult of personality,\" Walker said. \"Bernie isn’t the hero, the ideas are – and if he’s done fighting, we’re definitely not.\"  Biden and Sanders have come to an agreement to have Sanders supporters represented at the Democratic National Convention, according to a memo released by the two campaigns. All delegates would be reallocated to Biden, per DNC rules. But the two campaigns have agreed that the delegate slots Sanders had earned will be filled with Sanders supporters.  “While Senator Sanders is no longer actively seeking the nomination, the Biden campaign feels strongly that it is in the best interest of the party and the effort to defeat Donald Trump in November to come to an agreement regarding these issues that will ensure representation of Sanders supporters and delegate candidates, both on the floor and in committees,” the memo states.  Biden has also tried to reach out to younger and more progressive voters through platforms and news organizations that cater to that bloc. Earlier this month, he gave an exclusive address about his economic platform on NowThis News, a progressive news site that is social media-focused. A recent interview with Yahoo was broadcast on TikTok.  Many progressive groups acknowledged Biden's outreach is a positive step forward, as well as some of his policy changes. Leaders of the progressive groups noted there are many progressives who say they will still vote for Biden, but that right now, that is the extent of support they are willing to give.  \"Young people are really what make up the backbone ... and energy in Democratic campaigns,” Weber said.  “What I'm hearing from a lot of my peers is ‘yeah, some people aren't excited to vote but most of them are planning to vote.’ But people who might normally be knocking doors or making calls or things like that, I’m not hearing a lot of enthusiasm for that for Joe Biden at the moment.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 47, "positive": 113, "negative": 17, "sadness": 1, "disgust": 1, "joy": 8, "anger": 33, "surprise": 5, "fear": 6, "trust": 28}, "metadata": ["washington", "joe", "bernie", "climate", "presidential", "sanders", "progressive", "democratic", "initiatives", "biden", "grassroots", "campaign", "focused", "endorsed", "government-funded", "medicare", "debt", "students", "courting", "donald", "trump", "victory", "values", "youth", "sarah", "week's", "sunrise", "immigration", "adopt", "trillion", "stimulus", "expertise", "criminal", "ocasio-cortez", "co-founder", "convention", "coalition", "advances", "solutions", "galvanize", "enact", "tackle", "economy", "college", "united", "adviser", "diverse", "senate", "criticized", "funding", "supports", "professor", "university", "american", "leader", "emily", "america", "agreement", "ensure", "economic", "yahoo", "broadcast", "outreach", "weber"]}, {"text": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jeremy Powell is sounding the alarm — we must have another stimulus. The problem is that the package Democrats want is filled with socialist pork – dangerous pork given its long term effects.  Ironically, Democrats have already added trillions as a deal to get these packages and then attack the GOP for adding to the deficit.  “The ex­pan­sion is still far from com­plete,” Mr. Pow­ell said in re­marks to be de­liv­ered at a vir­tual eco­nomics con­fer­ence Tues­day. “At this early stage, I would ar­gue that the risks of pol­icy in­ter­ven­tion are still asym­met­ric.

For 68 days, Nancy Pelosi has played politics with American lives and livelihoods. Republicans have introduced bill after bill to help American families and businesses who continue to struggle as a result of Democrat-caused economic lockdowns.  The virus didn’t cause record-high unemployment. The virus didn’t force companies out of business. Local and state politicians did that, and most of them were Democrats.   NEW YORK IS PROOF  New York is a perfect example. Governor Cuomo keeps locking everything down — one size fits all. He comes up with arbitrary seating in restaurants and closes all the schools if a handful of children get the virus when he could allow quarantining of the affected. King Cuomo keeps closing everything, arbitrarily, instead of looking at the specifics. He’s destroying businesses, and he wins lawsuits because of corrupt judges.  Cuomo’s closing everything in nine zip codes. It’s illogical to go by zip codes. If you can’t go to a restaurant in Kew Gardens, you just walk down the block to one in Forest Hills. Cuomo isn’t very bright.   THE RELIEF PACKAGE  Pelosi has a package giving cities and states a trillion dollars of a 2 trillion dollar package with NO restrictions. They can spend it on anything they want. Republicans want it restricted to virus-related budget items only. Democrats want to pay bills for their profligate spending.  California would be allowed to use the funds to bail out illegal aliens. New York would be allowed to use the funds to defend against an NRA lawsuit. Illinois would be able to use the funding to bail out its public-sector unions’ pension programs. Washington State wants to give hundreds of dollars in cash to every illegal alien.  The only restrictions Pelosi put in was it couldn’t be used for policing. That is where they place their values.   The bill also includes:  It gives federal taxpayer-funded healthcare to illegal aliens — any illegal who wanders into the country.  Her bill allows ballot harvesting and revokes state-level ID laws.  She has funding in it for pot shops.  They want hundreds of millions for public broadcast and funding for local press retirement plans.  Policing of racial makeup of corporate boards is in the bill.  Endless climate change pork that won’t do a thing for climate change in our lifetimes or any likely.  There is more. Call your congresspeople and tell them to vote ‘no.’ None of this has anything to do with COVID-19.   These ads explain briefly:  President Trump is at war, protecting Americans from an unseen enemy.

Even if global warming were miraculously put to a complete stop right now, Greenland’s fast-melting ice sheet still wouldn’t recover to the levels seen just last week.  The study, published in the journal Nature Communications Earth and Environment, tapped into nearly forty years of satellite data from more than two hundred large glaciers to settle on the troubling findings—which revealed that Greenland’s massive ice sheet has indeed passed the point of no return.  “Glacier retreat has knocked the dynamics of the whole ice sheet into a constant state of loss,” the study’s co-author Ian Howat, an earth scientist from Ohio State University, said in a statement.  “Even if the climate were to stay the same or even get a little colder, the ice sheet would still be losing mass.”  Projecting that trend forward, the ice sheet is expected to lose mass ninety-nine out of every hundred years, the researchers noted.  The problem stems from the fact that snowfalls that replenish the ice sheet each year are not able to keep up with the melt rate of the glaciers.  “We’ve been looking at these remote sensing observations to study how ice discharge and accumulation have varied,” the study’s lead author, Michalea King, a researcher at Ohio State University, said in a statement.  “And what we’ve found is that the ice that’s discharging into the ocean is far surpassing the snow that’s accumulating on the surface of the ice sheet.”  According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ice loss from the Greenland ice sheet surged sevenfold from thirty-four billion tons a year from 1992 to 2001 to 247 billion tons annually from 2012 to 2016.  Greenland’s shrinking glaciers are a leading contributor to sea-level rise across the world. By the end of the century, the global sea level will likely be a foot higher than what was seen in 2000, according to NOAA.  Just last year, enough ice melted or broke off from the Greenland ice sheet to cause the oceans to rise by 2.2 millimeters in only two months.  The study’s findings are indeed bleak, but King noted that such data could be useful for future strategies that tackle climate change.  “It’s always a positive thing to learn more about glacier environments, because we can only improve our predictions for how rapidly things will change in the future,” she said.  “And that can only help us with adaptation and mitigation strategies. The more we know, the better we can prepare.”  Ethen Kim Lieser is a Minneapolis-based Science and Tech Editor who has held posts at Google, The Korea Herald, Lincoln Journal Star, AsianWeek and Arirang TV.

But Musa never returned, her mother Phindile Mbele recalled, choking back tears. The little girl drowned in the stream, which is thick with sewage, mud and algae, probably pulled down by a strong underwater current.  “We rushed down there. She was still under the water... Two boys from the neighborhood went in and one carried her out,” Mbele said. “The house is empty without her. She was such a sweet, quiet child”. Musa’s death last month further enflamed the mood among residents of Mandela Park town­ship on the edge of Qwaqwa in South Africa, turning intermittent protests over water shortages into a full-blown, week-long riot.  Protesters torched shops, over­turned government vehicles and hurled bricks and bottles at riot police who responded with rub­ber bullets. South Africans have protested for years over unreli­able supplies of water and power, but chronic mismanagement has been compounded by the effects of last year’s drought, the worst in a century, which has been linked to climate change.  “It rains here all the time but they say there’s drought. Then how did that little girl drown because that stream was full?” said Malgas “Skinny” John, 39, who used rocks and burning tyres during the January riot to barricade the road leading into Qwaqwa in a face-off with police.  “We have to strike and burn things, only then do we get water,” said the unemployed father of two, as he queued with neighbors to fill his container from a water truck. “We’ll do it again, we’ll keep burning things if we have to,” John added. Officials fear riots like the one seen at Qwaqwa could be a sign of worsening climate-linked instability to come, as dams and water pipes deteriorate further and the urban population contin­ues to mushroom.  South Africa’s water minister Lindiwe Sisulu has promised 3 bil­lion rand ($203 million) to end the shortages in Qwaqwa. Its munici­pality owes half a billion rand for water, out of a national unpaid bill of nearly 9 billion rand.  But even Sisulu’s own depart­ment has a 3.5 billion rand short­fall in maintenance funds, which it says risks a “detrimental impact on the national economy”, especially if water supplies to the thirsty power utility Eskom and liquid fuel maker Sasol are disrupted.  “We’ve been drinking this brown, filthy water since 2016,” said little Musa’s mother Mbele. “Nothing will change.

Lindsey Graham after the attack. “Iran will not stop their misbehavior until the consequences become more real, like attacking their refineries, which will break the regime’s back.”  Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed they were behind the attack, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo dismissed that as a fiction. “There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen,” he tweeted. “Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world’s energy supply.”  ‘LOCKED AND LOADED’: In a tweet last night, President Trump hinted he’s ready to pull the trigger on retaliatory strikes, once Saudi Arabia signs off. “There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification,” Trump said, “but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!”  Meanwhile, Trump said he has authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, if needed, “in a to-be-determined amount sufficient to keep the markets well-supplied.”  The president also tweeted that he had “informed all appropriate agencies to expedite approvals of the oil pipelines currently in the permitting process in Texas and various other States,” although it’s not clear what impact that would have on what is expected to be a short-term shortfall.  The tweets followed a meeting of the National Security Council at the White House that included Pompeo, Vice President Mike Pence, and Defense Secretary Mark Esper.  OIL PRICES SPIKE: It is estimated the sophisticated attack from a swarm of drones temporarily knocked out more than 5% of the world’s oil supply, and as a result oil prices jumped by as much as 20%.  Much of Saudi crude goes to California, where drivers may be the first to feel the impact with higher prices at the pump.  IRAN DENIES: “Having failed at ‘max pressure,’ @SecPompeo's turning to ‘max deceit,’” tweeted the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif. Iran says the attack was made by Houthi rebels in Yemen and is a result of the long-running war with a coalition led by Saudi Arabia. “US & its clients are stuck in Yemen because of illusion that weapon superiority will lead to military victory. Blaming Iran won't end disaster. Accepting our April '15 proposal to end war & begin talks may,” he tweeted.  NO MORE TALK OF MEETING: Iran is now ruling out any meeting between President Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the U.N. General Assembly session next week, Iran’s state-run media reported.  “Neither is such a plan on our agenda nor will such a thing happen. This meeting will not be held,\" said foreign ministry spokesman Seyed Abbas Mousavi at a press conference in Tehran, according to the state-run Fars news agency.  Despite administration officials saying last week Trump would be “happy to take a meeting with no preconditions” with Iran, the president tweeted last night, “The Fake News is saying that I am willing to meet with Iran, ‘No Conditions.’ That is an incorrect statement (as usual!).”  No explanation was forthcoming from the White House.   SUNDAY TALK SHOW REACTION:  “I think it's safe to say that the Houthis don't have the capability to do a strike like this without Iranian assistance. So Iranian know-how, Iranian technology, I think, was certainly involved,” said Rep. Adam Smith, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, on CBS. “Whether the Iranians directly engaged in this or through the Houthi proxies has yet to be seen. But I think it underscores just what we really frankly came to expect from this unending war in Yemen, that it would escalate tensions in the region, but also our withdrawal from the JCPOA has led Iran to engage … in these escalatory tactics.”  “I would say we should deny the visas for the Iranian delegates who are planning to come into the United States, come to New York next week for the U.N. General Assembly,” said Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney on NBC. “As her first step as our new U.N. ambassador, Kelly Craft … ought to offer a resolution for snapback sanctions. … They're operating in total violation of the Iranian nuclear deal. And we ought to have those sanctions snapped back.”  “I think an escalation of the war would be a big mistake,” said Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul on CBS. “This all comes from the Yemeni civil war, where Saudi Arabia is heavily involved in another country, indiscriminately bombing civilians, killing children. And the Houthis are supported by the Iranians. So it's back and forth. But, really, the answer is trying to have a negotiated cease-fire and peace in Yemen. And bombing Iran won't do that.”  Good Monday morning and welcome to Jamie McIntyre’s Daily on Defense, written and compiled by Washington Examiner National Security Senior Writer Jamie McIntyre ( @jamiejmcintyre ) and edited by Kelly Jane Torrance ( @kjtorrance ).

HAPPENING TODAY: President Trump welcomes to the White House at 3 p.m. Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa of Bahrain, a country that is one of America’s closest Gulf allies and hosts the headquarters of the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet.  You may recall Bahrain recently joined the United Kingdom and Australia in the U.S.-led “International Maritime Security Construct,” which is intended to protect shipping in the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz.  “The two leaders are expected to discuss maritime security, countering the threat from Iran, efforts to promote peace in the region, and counterterrorism,” said a White House statement.  ALSO TODAY: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is hosting Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iran’s Hassan Rouhani for a summit on Syria in the Turkish capital of Ankara, ostensibly to try to hammer out a truce in northwest Syria, where the forces of Syrian president Bashar Assad are gaining ground on the last rebel-held territory.  DUNFORD MEETS TURKISH COUNTERPART: With just two weeks left in his term, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford met with Chief of the Turkish General Staff Gen. Yasar Guler Saturday at a NATO Military Committee session in Ljubljana, Slovenia.  Turkey has just announced it has taken delivery of a second shipment of Russian S-400 anti-aircraft missiles and will soon activate the system over U.S. objections that it could compromise NATO systems. Erdogan’s refusal to buy U.S. Patriot missiles instead led to Turkey’s expulsion from the F-35 program, in which it was a production partner. But Erdogan is reportedly floating an offer to buy Patriots in addition to the Russian system.  Nevertheless, the United States and Turkey “enjoy a strong and continuous military-to-military relationship as key members of the NATO alliance,” according to a readout from Col. Patrick Ryder, a spokesman for Dunford, who said the two generals discussed “updates to the security situation in Syria and the importance of U.S.-Turkish cooperation in the region.”  HAPPENING THIS WEEK: The Air Force Association’s annual Air, Space and Cyber Conference gets underway at National Harbor, Maryland, this morning. The three-day event features a cast of heavy-hitters including Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein, U.S. Space Command head Gen. John Raymond, and Defense Secretary Mark Esper.  Check out our calendar below for dates and times of some of the key speakers.  HAMZA BIN LADEN: On Saturday, President Trump confirmed the long-rumored death of Hamza bin Laden, the son of late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, in a U.S. counterterrorism operation in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region.  The death was announced in a statement posted on the White House website, which gave no details or timeframe for the strike.  \"The loss of Hamza bin Ladin not only deprives al-Qa'ida of important leadership skills and the symbolic connection to his father, but undermines important operational activities of the group,\" the president said in the statement.  “Good riddance. I think this is someone of great symbolic value to al Qaeda,” said Rep. Schiff on CBS. “He was not, I think, a current leader of al Qaeda in an operational sense.”  “If his name wasn't bin Laden, it wouldn't have had the same impact, but nonetheless an important step in terms of taking more of the leadership of al Qaeda off the battlefield,” said Schiff, who indicated he had been aware of the death for some time. “It also shows the importance of the region to us in terms of our security, that we need to maintain some footprint or some guarantee that al Qaeda won't resurge in the area.”  WHISTLEBLOWER FLAP: On Friday, Schiff — in his role as chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence — issued a subpoena to the Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire to compel the production of a whistleblower complaint that the intelligence community inspector general determined to be credible and a matter of “urgent concern.”  Yesterday, he expressed outrage that Maguire was refusing to turn over the complaint, as required by law, insisting he’s answering to a higher authority.  “No DNI, no director of national intelligence has ever refused to turn over a whistleblower complaint,” Schiff said on Face the Nation on CBS. “It's a pretty narrow group of people that it could apply to that are both above the DNI in authority and also involve privileged communications. So I think it's fair to assume this involves either the president or people around him or both.”  “But at the end of the day, if the director of national intelligence is going to undermine the whistleblower protections, it means that people are going to end up taking the law into their own hands and going directly to the press, instead of the mechanism that Congress set to protect classified information.”  IN DEFENSE OF ISRAEL: President Trump tweeted on Saturday that he spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone about a potential defense treaty between Israel and the United States after Tuesday’s Israeli elections.  Trump said the deal \"would further anchor the tremendous alliance between our two countries.\"  The announcement drew praise from the Jewish Institute for National Security of America.”This past July, a JINSA task force led by notable retired U.S. military leaders, chaired by Adm. James Stavridis, formerly NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe, issued a paper advocating such a pact and drafted a proposed text for such a treaty, after proposing it last year,” the group said in a statement.

(Photo: Photo courtesy of Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission.)  MOLE LAKE - Wild rice harvest season runs through mid-September in northern Wisconsin, and while many tribal and non-tribal people are enjoying their annual pilgrimages to their favorite rice wetlands, others are concerned about the effects of climate change on this unique crop.  With its rich, nutty and complex flavor, the wild rice that grows in Wisconsin and Minnesota is one of a kind.  “It isn’t found anywhere else in the world,” said Peter David, a biologist with the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission. “We have to be global stewards of this food.”  Wild rice, known by its Ojibwe name as manoomin, is an important part of Ojibwe culture.  “I can’t really overstate how centered manoomin is to Ojibwe identity,” David said.  The Ojibwe had once lived on the eastern seaboard, according to the tribal migration story, and there was a prophecy that stated if they wanted to survive as a people they would have to move west.  They kept moving westward for several generations as the prophecy commanded until they found “a place where the food grows on water” and they finally found their home in northern Wisconsin and Minnesota.  Wild rice is a food that has high nutritional value and can be stored for a long time, such as through winter.  “It was really an important sustenance food,” David said.  Rice harvesters are pictured on the Sokaogon reservation. (Photo: Sokaogon Chippewa Community)  Wild rice contains about 10.5 grams of protein, nearly 4 grams more than white rice, about 4 more grams of fiber than white rice, 8 more milligrams of calcium than white rice and more than 359 more milligrams of potassium than white rice.  It also is very high in antioxidants and is gluten-free, David said.  Wild rice grows in shallow wetlands between a half-foot to 3 feet in depth in rich, organic substrates.  It is typically harvested by two people in a non-motorized canoe with one using a push pole to provide the propulsion and the other using two sticks to gently shake the stalks to loosen the rice grains that fall into the boat.  With this method, about 90% of the seeds fall back into the water, ensuring another crop for the next year.  Each seed is enclosed in a husk, and the traditional process for separating the rice includes first spreading the crop to dry on birch bark mats.  The rice is then parched over a low fire before being placed in a lined hole in the ground, where someone wearing a special set of moccasins would dance on it in a tip-toe fashion as a form of threshing.  A ricer with the Sokaogon manoomin youth camp harvests wild rice on the reservation. (Photo: Photo courtesy of GLIFWC)  The Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission in a cooperative effort with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources monitors and manages about 6,000 acres of off-reservation wild rice wetlands in the state, which can produce about 60,000 pounds of rice annually.  Non-tribal members can purchase a family license for $8.25 from the state to harvest the off-reservation rice in accordance with the state’s stipulations, which include hours of operation and only when the rice is ripe as determined by the DNR and Ojibwe rice chiefs.  David said there is a small global market for wild rice and purveyors are usually small, family-run operations.  He said there are larger operations that sell cultivated rice that doesn’t taste quite the same as wild rice.  Cultivated rice is supposed to be labeled as such, but David said one way to tell the difference is price because cultivated rice can sell for about $20 for a 5-pound bag while just 1 pound of wild rice can sell for $15.  David and other wild rice experts are worried about the impact of climate change on wild rice.  “Manoomin is a plant adapted to harsh northern environments, and nearly every prediction of change brings negative impacts to wild rice,” he said. “We are already seeing failures of infrastructure on some human-made flowages that support rice with whole beds being uprooted after heavy rainfall events, which caused increased levels of disease outbreaks associated with wetter, warmer and more humid conditions.”  Peter McGeshick III, a rice chief with the Sokaogon Community of Mole Lake Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, has been harvesting rice for more than 50 years on the reservation and said this year is a particularly bad harvest.  “When the BIA (Bureau of Indian Affairs) agent came to ask why we chose this place for our reservation, our chief showed him a handful of wild rice,” he said.  McGeshick said seven bodies of water had once grown wild rice on the reservation, but increasing water levels, such as from run-off water, have decreased that to only one body of water they call Rice Lake.  Last year, the harvest from Rice Lake was about 23,000 pounds, but this year’s harvest will only be about 5% of that, McGeshick said.  He said he’s been praying with his tobacco pouch on the lake in the hopes of restoring its health.  The problem is brown spot disease and the rice worm, which thrive when there’s too much water and humidity in the rice wetlands.  Rice harvesters are pictured on the Sokaogon reservation. (Photo: Sokaogon Chippewa Community)  The region has been impacted by heavy rains this year.  “This year is a different year, but it happened for a reason,” McGeshick said. “We will have rice, but not as much as we’d like. We’ll take what the Creator gives and we’ll give thanks to the Creator.”  McGeshick said he was still able to harvest about 750 pounds of rice to be used in reseeding projects elsewhere, including in the Green Bay area.  And one couple recently was able to harvest about 35 pounds, he said.  McGeshick said he’s aware that other Ojibwe communities in different regions that haven’t suffered as adverse conditions are having bumper harvests this year.  David said harvest estimates aren’t yet available for this year, but he is hearing anecdotal evidence of good harvests in the Hayward area.  “There are some lakes that are much better than others just about every year,” he said.  McGeshick said he’s been working with biologists and others on projects to help control the water levels on Rice Lake because rice is such an essential part of his community.  “Wild rice talks to you if you listen to it,” he said. “In the breeze, you can hear that spirit that let’s you know everything is good and ‘I’m here for you, I’m here to help you.’ … There’s a calming effect being in the wild rice. … It’s who we are as a people.”  Frank Vaisvilas is a Report For America corps member based at the Green Bay Press-Gazette covering Native American issues in Wisconsin.

As the youngest American to row solo across the Atlantic in 2009, aged 25, he had months of sea time under his belt.  “On another route, like the Atlantic, you can get more wind or more seas on any given day, but there’s no ice, there’s not a third factor,” Ridley said. “I was terrified pretty much the whole time.”  Ridley, who now lives in Hong Kong, and the team – Collin West, Neal Mueller and Scott Mortensen – spent 41 days at sea and covered 2,000km. They intended to land at Providenya in Russia, but the weather forced them to change destination to Point Hope, Alaska. It was far longer at sea than they had expected, as they faced head winds the entire time.  But being the first – only a few ships had sailed through – there was little to no weather data for them to draw on. In fact, there was not even a clear definition of what constituted rowing across the Arctic Ocean.  “The compelling thing about it was it was the challenge from the planning perspective and the rowing perspective,” he said. “The first thing was how we’d even know if we had rowed across the Arctic and what that even means. How do you define ‘across’ and how do you define ‘Arctic Ocean’.”  Having finally settled on a route that they thought met both terms, they set off. The trials and tribulations at hand were as gruelling as any expedition. And now he is sharing those lessons with another team, including this author, as they aim to be the first people to row through the Northwest Passage in 2021 – the 4,000km Arctic route that links the Atlantic and the Pacific.  The last few hundred miles of the Northwest Passage row will cover much of Ridley’s same route.  “We were dodging ice all the time. We were caught in ice multiple times,” he said.  “It’s pretty tense to be honest. There are a few days I think of when we were locked in ice and fog. We were rowing through incredibly narrow passages in the ice, a lot of them were just wide enough for our oars to still be rowable.”  “Visibility was zero and you know there are polar bears out there. You feel lucky to be the one going to sleep at the end of your shift. That time is very tense.”  The main contrast to the Atlantic is the difficulty establishing a routine. With the ice disrupting shift patterns, the rowers had to constantly adapt and stay alert.  “It is very much mentally draining,” Ridley said.  Ridley remembers that no matter how warm they were from rowing, their feet always suffered. They each came up their own solution. He crumpled up the foil bags from their dried food rations and stuffed them in his boots. It alleviated the issue but never solved it.  “It is a scary kind of cold. You’re not that cold all the time, but everyone in the crew had moments when they were scary cold.”  They would boil water and place water bottles under the suffering teammate’s armpits and neck.  “You have to count on your team when it happens,” Ridley said.  “We found that it happened when someone was fatigued, or lazy. When you are getting ready for your shift, if you take a couple of extra minutes before you get dressed and it means you miss one of the layers on your feet, for example, then you are not ready for a four-hour rowing shift in the Arctic.  “It was things like that which got you into trouble – looking after yourself is incredibly important, not just to ease the pain of being cold for a shift, but it’s dangerous if not everyone on board can row.”  Another common factor across his and the Northwest Passage row is that both are only possible because the ice is retreating for longer every year owing to climate change.  “When we did that row in the summer of 2012 it turned out to be a record low year for Arctic ice and since then almost every year has been a record low year.  “One of our goals was to bring attention to that fact. It is now rowable and it shouldn’t be, and it’s getting worse. The cause is still there, and the need for people to be aware is still there, so in that sense I’d do it again,” he said.  “But from the perspective of going up there and being on the oars for 12 hours a day, with four other guys on a boat not really built for that, it would be a long time before I choose to do that again for fun.”  Above all, he remembers the incredible First Nations and Inuit people who he met at the start and finish. The latter put on a welcome ceremony and shared gifts. And the beautiful landscape will forever be etched in his mind, especially on the clear days when the sunset would last for six hours.  “It’s an incredible part of the world. You’re going to have a blast. It is an experience you’ll talk about for the rest of your life,” he added. “But try to keep your feet warm.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 16, "positive": 17, "negative": 3, "disgust": 2, "joy": 6, "anger": 9, "fear": 4, "trust": 6}, "metadata": ["arctic", "american", "atlantic", "scott", "compelling", "links", "moments", "climate", "nations"]}, {"text": "Tinder has analysed the data of its successful Australian matches and revealed which star signs belong together - and how your zodiac affects what you share online.

These confident catches max out on the photos they show and can't help but tout how 'lit' they are.  They also can't help but talk about themselves, with bios crammed with every interest you can think of, with honourable mentions to 'podcasts' and 'hiking'.  Even on Tinder, Aries want to look like a boss and they're most likely to list 'manager' as their job, Tinder Australia said (stock image)  Taurus April 19 – May 20: Most likely to match with Taurus  When it comes to dating, Tauruses know exactly what they want... and that's themselves.  Not only do they swipe the most Tauruses are also the fastest to respond to messages. Better yet, they're one of the signs most likely to swipe right.  Tauruses are one of the top signs to include both 'food' and 'drinks' in their bio, so be prepared to wine and dine your next Taurus Tinder match.  Gemini May 21 – June 21: Most likely to match with Aquarius  Geminis broadcast their up for anything nature by touting beer, music and travel-related emojis in their bio. So if you choose to swipe on a Gemini, have your adventure game ready.  These social butterflies are ready to party all night, which may explain why you might find them bartending- they are most likely to list this as their job out of any sign - or belting out their top Spotify anthem 'Roxanne'.  Sadly for Aquarius, however, Geminis are least likely to swipe right.  Cancer June 21 – July 22: Most likely to match with Aquarius  To catch one of these supportive empaths you'll need to bring your 'real' and 'genuine' self - qualities they name check in their bios.  And if they don't reply to your message right away, don't worry, it's not you.  Cancers are among the slowest in responding to messages.  And if they don't reply to your message right away, don't worry, it's not you (stock image)  Leo July 23 – August 22: Most likely to match with Aries  Leos may be vain, but when it comes to Tinder, they're definitely at the top of the dating game.  They're most likely to swipe right and fittingly Leos are also the most likely to name their sign in their bio.  Speaking of being on top, Leos are the only sign to list CEO as their top job.  And in case you didn't already know they're extra, they're also most likely to 'flex' in their bios with all of their achievements and provocative pictures.  Virgo August 23 – September 22: Most likely to match with: Scorpio  This shy sign is least likely to call out their sign in their bio.  If you're on the prowl for a Virgo, look for them to call out their 'hardworking' nature.  If you're 'spontaneous', looking to 'explore' or 'high key', expect Virgos to steer clear: these terms are least likely to make their way into a Virgo profile.  If you're 'spontaneous', looking to 'explore' or 'high key', expect Virgos to steer clear: these terms are least likely to make their way into a Virgo profile (stock image)  Libra September 22 – October 22: Most likely to match with: Aries  While other signs may look to the stars for love Libras look to the scales.  Pragmatic in life and in love, Libras appreciate balance, logic and authenticity, which is probably why they are the most likely sign to have 'authentic' in their bio.  They know how to get things done and have a higher right swipe rate to prove it.  Scorpio October 23 – November 22: Most likely to match with Virgo  Tap into a Scorpios determined, resourceful nature if you're planning on swiping right to one.  Scorpios often identify as 'entrepreneurs' in their bio.  They also show their passion in their swipe: they have amongst the highest swipe rate of any signs.  But then they like to slow things down they take the longest to respond to a message.  Passionate Scorpios often identify as 'entrepreneurs' in their bio (stock image)  Sagittarius November 21 – December 21: Most likely to match with Capricorn  These idealists are not easily impressed, the data confirmed.  They're among the least likely to swipe right, but once you've matched, get ready for action.  They move quickly from match to first message, showing they aren't afraid to make the first move.  They advertise their 'spontaneity' and 'fun' spirit in their profile in hopes they'll catch the attention of someone who can keep up.  Capricorn December 21 – January 21: Most likely to match with Sagittarius  Capricorns might be hard to catch on Tinder, but if you find one of these profoundly intelligent partners, it's worth the work.  They're ambitious, frequently touting their 'hardworking' nature in their bios, which doesn't leave them with much time for swiping.  They have the fewest swipes (right or left) of any sign.  They're ambitious, frequently touting their 'hardworking' nature in their bios, which doesn't leave them with much time for swiping (stock image)  Aquarius January 21 – February 20: Most likely to match with Sagittarius  Humanitarian activist Aquarians put their call out for a partner with words like 'volunteer' and 'climate change'.  They're most likely to call themselves artists or use terms like 'music', 'concert' and 'museum' in their bio.  So it's no wonder Aquarians swipe right less often than other signs; another climate-marching, museum-hound combo isn't exactly easy to find.  Pisces February 19 – March 20: Most likely to match with Aquarius  Pisces are all about the feelings and they like to catch them too, though they may be aloof about it.  The emotional and intuitive Pisces want people to know they find the world inside their head just as interesting as the one outside.  This may be the reason why they are the slowest sign to respond to messages, but you know their response will be thoughtful.

But health experts are questioning that decision. Trump will head to Tulsa, Oklahoma — a state that has seen relatively few COVID-19 cases. Yet the Tulsa City-County Health Department’s director told the Tulsa World over the weekend that he wished the Trump campaign would move the date back because of a ‘significant increase in our case trends.’ … Other health experts also cite the danger of infection spreading among the crowd and sparking outbreaks when people return to their homes. The Trump campaign itself acknowledges the risk in a waiver attendees must agree to absolving them of any responsibility should people get sick. … Scientists believe the virus spreads far more easily in crowded enclosed spaces than it does outdoors, where circulating air has a better chance of dispersing virus particles. … The CDC recommends cloth masks in places where people might shout or chant.”  Especially Tulsa’s Health Department director - Tulsa World: “In an interview with the Tulsa World on Saturday, Dr. Bruce Dart said Tulsa is seeing a ‘significant increase in our case trends’ that makes a large gathering like the rally dangerous for not only attendees, but the president himself. ‘I think it’s an honor for Tulsa to have a sitting president want to come and visit our community, but not during a pandemic,’ said Dart. … State officials on Saturday reported 225 new cases of COVID-19, once again marking a new high in daily increases for both the state and Tulsa County. … Dart said his concern stems from a sudden spike in cases he said likely comes from a combination of factors, but not increased testing.”  Supporters will get masks, sanitizer, temperature checks - USA Today: “Supporters who plan to attend President Donald Trump's election rally in Oklahoma this week will be given temperature checks, hand sanitizer and face masks before entering the venue as safety measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the Trump campaign said Monday. Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale announced the precautions in a tweet in what appeared to be the first steps the campaign has taken to address coronavirus concerns at the president's first rally in more than three months. Last week, the campaign attempted to shield itself from any virus-related lawsuits from people who might get sick at the rally by including a liability disclaimer on the sign-up page for free tickets to the event.”  Expanded unemployment benefits will end in July - Politico: “National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow reiterated Sunday the $600 additional weekly unemployment benefit created to aid those who lost their jobs due to the coronavirus pandemic will end in late July. ‘I mean, we're paying people not to work. It's better than their salaries would get,’ he said on CNN's ‘State of the Union.’ ‘That might have worked for the first couple of months. It'll end in late July,’ he added, saying the extra benefit was necessary during the height of the coronavirus lockdowns. Kudlow said that ‘almost all businesses’ understand the $600 additional benefit is ‘a disincentive.’ He said the Trump administration is instead ‘looking at a reform measure’ that will provide an incentive for returning to work, but it will not be as substantial. ‘It will not be as large, and it will create an incentive to work,’ he said.”  Republicans mark best-ever online fundraising day celebrating Trump - Fox News: “The Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign posted their largest online fundraising day ever on Sunday, bringing in $14 million across three entities on the president's birthday — smashing their previous online fundraising record of $10 million on Oct. 19, 2016. The surge in cash comes as Republicans' war chest continues to dwarf Democrats' holdings, as it has for the entire primary cycle. Trump and the RNC – which have been building a fundraising juggernaut for more than three years – have roughly $255 million cash on hand, compared with the approximately $100 million the Joe Biden campaign and DNC have in their coffers. A competitive primary with numerous candidates on the Democratic side essentially stalled their effort to consolidate donations for months. The RNC, along with the Trump Make America Great Again Committee (TMAGAC) and Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. (DJTP), received an average online gift of $46, Fox News is told. Trump turned 74 on Sunday.”  Rothman: Trump distracts from Dems infighting - Commentary: “For several weeks, the Democratic Party has been at war with itself. An intraparty feud has broken out among the Democratic officials who govern America’s cities and their constituents who resent being aggressively overpoliced. Racial tensions in dark-blue urban enclaves have spilled into the streets. The public sector unions beholden to Democratic politicians in these municipalities are struggling to preserve their advantages against the forces of reform. The party is divided, almost down the middle, over the efficacy of radical measures that are anathema to the general public. All these conditions should theoretically benefit the incumbent president. So, what does Donald Trump do at this potentially advantageous moment? Randomly exhume the corpses of Confederate dead and put them on a pedestal. Of course.”  THE RULEBOOK: ONE FOR ALL  “As the safety of the whole is the interest of the whole, and cannot be provided for without government, either one or more or many, let us inquire whether one good government is not, relative to the object in question, more competent than any other given number whatever.” – John Jay, Federalist No. 4  TIME OUT: IT WAS FOR SCIENCE!  Smithsonian: “In retrospect, perhaps toasting the success of a new medication he helped invent with several shots of vodka in Moscow was not a good idea. However, it was too late to go back. English research scientist Stewart Adams was faced with the consequences of his actions: a serious hangover. As he woke up that morning in 1971, Adams realized he needed to do something to relieve his throbbing headache, so he could coherently deliver an important speech at a pharmacological conference in a few hours. He reached for that new drug and swallowed a 600-milligram dose. Voila! … While the drug had been tested for pain in clinical trials, no one had yet tried it on an alcohol-induced headache. … Stewart Adams and his associate John Nicholson invented a pharmaceutical drug known as 2-(4-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid. It was later renamed ibuprofen and is now one of the world’s most popular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)...”  Flag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.

Biden Jr.’s advisers have conducted several rounds of interviews with a select group of vice-presidential candidates and are beginning to gather private documents from some of them, as they attempt to winnow a field that features the most diverse set of vice-presidential contenders in history. The search committee has been in touch with roughly a dozen women, and some eight or nine are already being vetted more intensively. Among that group are two contenders who have recently grown in prominence, Representative Val Demings of Florida and Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta. One well-known candidate, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, has lost her perch as a front-runner. And some lower-profile candidates, like Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, are advancing steadily in the search process. The New York Times spoke to an array of people who are familiar with the vice-presidential search and the activities of the Biden team, and the interviews yielded the fullest picture yet of the list of candidates Mr. Biden is considering, who is advancing and who may be fading, and the dynamics at play.”  Biden brings in massive haul in small dollar donations - Bloomberg: “Joe Biden’s campaign has transformed the virtual fundraisers made necessary by virus-related lockdowns into a money machine, drawing in tens of thousands of small-dollar donations from supporters eager to engage with celebrities or Biden allies. Biden pulled in $16 million from small donors in April, more than three times the $4.9 million President Donald Trump raised in small amounts for the month. Hosts that included breakout Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg, celebrity yoga instructor Kyle Miller and 1970s ‘Wonder Woman’ star Lynda Carter. Campaigns report their May numbers to the Federal Election Commission on June 20. Unlike in-person fundraisers, which require travel, extensive planning and money to execute in strategically chosen locales, online events cost almost nothing to produce, allowing the campaign to innovate and take chances.”  Drucker: Well-heeled Republicans for Biden making their mark - WashEx: “Never Trump Republicans are coordinating efforts to oust President Trump, even consulting with Democratic groups in a bid to deploy resources efficiently and compare notes on effective messaging strategy. Republican Voters Against Trump, a new addition to the Never Trump ecosphere, is planning to spend $10 million on television and digital advertising in key battleground states. The group is focused on transforming Republican voters who backed Trump in 2016 into supporters of presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Top strategists at RVAT regularly touch base with Project Lincoln, a Never Trump group of prominent establishment Republicans already on the air with ads targeting the president. Both stay in touch with top Democratic outside groups, such as American Bridge, a liberal organization dedicated to opposition research, in a bid to maximize their campaign to take down Trump.”  GOP CONGRESSMAN OUSTED, OPENING DOOR FOR DEMS  The Roanoke Times: “Rep. Denver Riggleman, a first-term Republican from Nelson County, whose libertarian views and decision to officiate a same-sex marriage set in motion an intra-party challenge, lost his bid for renomination on Saturday. Bob Good, a former Campbell County supervisor and Liberty University employee, defeated Riggleman, whom President Donald Trump had endorsed, with 58% of the vote. Good has described himself as a ‘bright red Biblical and constitutional conservative.’ Good said he looks forward to making the district ‘bright red again.’ … Following his win, Good needs to resolve a problem with his failure to file his candidate qualification paperwork to the Virginia Department of Elections before the June 9 deadline. He filed it on Friday. ...Good’s team has been reassuring people they are confident the Board of Elections will grant him an extension. The Republican Party of Virginia has requested the deadline be extended, arguing the deadline is usually the day the state-run primary is held.”  Ocasio-Cortez rakes in big bucks for primary - Fox News: “Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., once again proved her fundraising prowess by raising $2.4 million in just two months as she kicks up her campaign operation before her June 23 primary election, according to federal campaign finance reports she filed this week. Her April and May cash haul brings the total raised for her reelection bid to more than $10.5 million, making the freshman rep among the best fundraisers for the Democrats, along with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., federal elections records show. Ocasio-Cortez, 30, is facing a spirited Democratic primary challenge from former TV journalist and CNBC anchor Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, who is running as a pro-business moderate in the Queens and Bronx district. She's hit Ocasio-Cortez for opposing Amazon bringing one of its headquarters to New York. Caruso-Cabrera raised $930,000 during the same two-month period, bringing her total to more than $2 million for the entire election cycle.”  Dem establishment rallies to save Engel from Ocasio-Cortez-backed challenger - Politico: “House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn and Rep. Adam Schiff are endorsing Rep. Eliot Engel, the pair of Democratic heavyweights offering their full support as the embattled New Yorker fights to hold onto the seat he’s represented for more than three decades. Clyburn, the No. 3 House Democrat, and Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, have considerable influence within Democratic politics. Both men praised Engel for his longtime service to his Bronx district and tenure as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in statements exclusively obtained by POLITICO on Sunday.”  Markey gets radical as he seeks to fend off Kennedy - Politico: “The Massachusetts Democratic Senate primary faded into the background here in recent months as the coronavirus pandemic overshadowed everything else. But if the most recent Senate debate between Sen. Ed Markey and Rep. Joe Kennedy III is any indication, that’s about to change. The incumbent senator derided Kennedy on Monday as a ‘progressive in name only’ and called him out for working for a conservative Republican district attorney early in his career. Markey also slammed the four-term congressman for failing to lead on any number of issues, ranging from ‘Medicare for All’ to climate change to the militarization of law enforcement. Markey didn’t have much choice but to let it rip. He’s trailed Kennedy in most public polls taken this year, has less money in the bank and the Covid-19 crisis has served to complicate his task of capturing attention against the scion of the state’s most prominent political family.”  Republicans shift focus to China - NYT: “When Senator Martha McSally, one of the most politically endangered Republicans, was asked last month about reports that President Trump had brushed away warnings from his own aides about the looming threat of the coronavirus, she promptly pivoted. ‘I learned the day I entered the military, never trust a communist,’ Ms. McSally answered. ‘China is to blame for this pandemic and the death of thousands of Americans.’ … Fighting for their political lives amid twin domestic crises — a pandemic that has battered the economy — vulnerable Republican senators running for re-election are working to divert voters’ gazes half a world away and make their races a referendum on China. The tactic, party strategists say, is a way for Republicans to avoid defending the president’s handling of the virus, which has been met with widespread public disapproval, and instead offer up an alternative issue that already inspires fear and skepticism among voters.”   PLAY-BY-PLAY  SupCo rules gay workers protected from job discrimination, in big win for LGBT rights - Fox News  Pergram: What will November be about? - Fox News  Cuomo threatens to shut down again as social-distancing rules get broken - Fox News   AUDIBLE: MEAN SENATORS  “Hey, Ron, somebody asked me about your investigations, and I wasn’t that nice.” – Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, running into Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., after speaking with Politico about the probes of prominent Dems and former Obama administration officials.   FROM THE BLEACHERS  “You outkicked your coverage in your response to Rick Randell on the cause of the Civil War. As you must know, the six Deep South states that originally seceded cited protection of their slavery-based agricultural society, but the remaining Confederate states, led by Virginia, didn’t secede until after Lincoln announced his intent to use military force to compel their return to the Union, a clear violation of a state’s right as commonly understood at the time. (A few decades earlier Abolitionists in Massachusetts had debated their own secession.) You came closer to the mark on your second try, that secession caused the war – not slavery or state’s rights. The South did not declare war – Lincoln’s provocations in South Carolina and Florida notwithstanding. Lincoln simply refused to allow secession. Under what provision of the Constitution did he do so? The real question is why did Lincoln choose war? Why didn’t he even call Congress back into session to debate the issue? Why did he refuse to meet with the South’s peace delegation in DC to discuss an amicable path forward? Why did he unilaterally author military incursions into South Carolina and Florida, in violation of the truce that followed secession and with the clear intent to provoke the South into firing the first shot? It’s often said, with misplaced pride, that the US endured a Civil War and half a million deaths to end slavery. The reality is that slavery, having outlived its economic reason for being, ended peacefully in the entire Western world with the cruel exception of the US. Because Lincoln chose war.” – Chris Sales, Fort Collins, Colo.  [Ed. note: I know you and those who hold dear this view of Lincoln as the villain of the story are sincere and earnest. And I know from years of hard-earned experience that no argument I am going to make – constitutional, political or moral – is likely to dissuade you, Mr. Sales. And I don’t agree with those who might say it makes you a bigot or a disloyal American to argue that we would have been better off if 150 years ago we proceeded as two nations instead of one and saw the continuation of state-sanctioned human chattel slavery for another two or three decades before it petered out into some variant of the apartheid-style system imposed after Reconstruction. There’s certainly enough wrong with how things worked out to imagine something different may have been better and you are free to imagine alternatives. I know you and your cohorts imagine the world today would have been better through the dissolution of the Union and expansion of slavery for a generation more. But we will never know, because a one-term congressman from Illinois, against all odds, snagged the Republican nomination and then won the presidency with a popular plurality thanks to a three-way-split among the Democrats. He got to make the real history and it was he who got to put the final seal on the Founders’ vision and intent for our republic. We are free to imagine what might have been and indulge in thought experiments, and they can be interesting indeed. But I am sorry that you guys have to go without the valuable instruction Lincoln’s life and astonishing success provides us. Maybe consider envisioning a world in which the Union dissolves after President John Breckenridge is elected 1860 and can’t keep North and South together anyway. In that alternate history you could at least get the benefit of Lincoln’s wisdom, like his 1838 Lyceum Address, without it being clouded by your resentment for his crushing the rebellion.]  “...your response to Mr. Randall in Friday's newsletter was spot on about Virginians deciding what to do with their own monuments. Might you continue that thought with the ‘however...’ part about what happens when you try or succeed in removing historic items? How are future generations to learn that we (society) have made strides to right the wrongs of our past countrymen if our kids are never taught why a certain statue or named street ‘is’ for lack of a better term. Growth requires learning from past mistakes, not removing them.” – Mark Hoffman, Des Moines, Iowa  [Ed. note: Statues of bad guys are not so tricky. Nobody wondered why Iraqis didn’t want statues and murals of Saddam Hussein around or why Romanians were happy to take down the tributes to Nicolae Ceaușescu. Black Memphians would understandably feel the same way about a statue of Nathan Bedford Forrest, father of the first iteration of the Ku Klux Klan and author of the massacre of hundreds of black prisoners of war at Ft. Pillow. Giant statues celebrate and honor. That’s what they’re for. I suppose one could argue that the statue, erected in 1905, is a reminder of how bigoted and spiteful city leaders in Memphis were at the time. But that context would be lost without establishing lots of contemporary displays explaining the statue’s continued presence despite the repudiation of the man it honored. Hardly seems worth it to preserve a statue to a genocidal maniac. So, I don’t think keeping a 20-foot-tall statue of Mr. Firstest-With-The-Mostest was necessary or helpful in “learning from past mistakes.” But genocidal maniacs make for easy answers. It gets more challenging when we get to names like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. Here the fight isn’t over learning from our mistakes but the fact that many -- most? -- Americans believe they should still be honored. And what about their monuments, memorials and namesakes? Here the argument isn’t the watery business about learning from mistakes, but a real defense that these men, despite their failings, deserve our respect and gratitude. The Founders do not belong in the same category as the Confederates, and different arguments apply. The Founders generation renamed many places and things that were intended to honor the British monarchy (though many tavern keepers were happy that their last king and first president shared a first name). It’s natural for these kinds of honors to be reconsidered in time. What remains to be seen is if Americans are still fond enough of our system and its founding to fight to celebrate the men who made it possible. And that’s not a cause helped by both sides lumping Washington in with the likes of Forrest.]  Share your color commentary: Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM and please make sure to include your name and hometown.  KILROY WAS HERE, AND HE BROUGHT PASTE  Fox News: “A woman in London decided to redecorate one of the rooms in her house and started stripping the wallpaper. As she peeled back the layers, she says she uncovered a message that had been hidden behind the walls for over two decades. Charlotte Morrison spoke with Fox News, saying that finding the message made the hours spent stripping the wallpaper worth it. She uploaded a photo of the note to Facebook, which reads, ‘If you ever need to wallpaper this room again, it will take eight rolls of wallpaper. I bought just six rolls at £17 (about $21) per roll. I didn’t have enough (it really pissed me off).’ The note was simply signed ‘Jon’ and was dated Dec. 21, 1997. After posting the picture on Facebook, it received over 17,000 likes and was shared over 14,000 times. Amazingly, the post eventually reached Jon’s family, who contacted Morrison. ‘It really made me chuckle and I’m just pleased that (Jon’s) relative contacted me and I could tell him how his note made so many people laugh,’ she explained.”  AND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES…  “‘Dying is easy. Parking is hard.’ Art Buchwald's little witticism nicely captured his chosen path to a good death: mocking it to the very end.” – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in Time magazine on March 5, 2007.

The alarming manoeuvre comes as Russia’s president Vladimir Putin reinstituted a cruise missile base that is within range of UK targets, the Mail on Sunday has reported. According to military experts, the advance of Russian vessels into waters formerly dominated by the Royal and US navies is a Cold War tactic for taunting adversaries.   Trending  Russia’s Akula-class submarines were seen navigating in proximity to the UK’s coast, naval sources reported.  Russia currently seems prepared to continue testing nuclear-powered cruise missiles.  Such weapons would have the capacity to hit Britain from the newly-reopened launch base.  A source told the Mail on Sunday: “The sheer number of Russian submarines entering the North Atlantic is overwhelming.  Vladimir Putin reinstituted a cruise missile base that is within range of UK targets  “The tactics adopted by their captains are deliberately provocative and highly dangerous.  “While our Astute-class submarines sailing from Faslane in Scotland are a match for their best submarines, the Russians are sometimes deploying two or three submarines into our areas of operations where previously they would have sent only one.  “The war-gaming and manoeuvring has never been more intense, especially when we are unable to precisely locate our enemies.  “The situation is serious and must be addressed by the Government before it is too late.” READ: Boris Johnson shares huge China update as up to THREE MILLION Hong Kongers head to UK  The advance of Russian vessels into waters formerly dominated by the Royal and US navies is a Cold War tactic for taunting adversaries  On Saturday, First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff Tony Radakin said Russia is “more active in the Atlantic – our backyard – than it has been for over 30 years”.  The head of the Royal Navy also anticipated that China could soon pass the through the region.  He said climate change is causing the creation of maritime routes due to the regression of the Arctic, allowing China’s advance.  Earlier this month, he said: “Climate change is a concern for all of us, but it is opening up new maritime trade routes across the top of the world, halving the transit time between Europe and Asia.

(AP) — Cindy McCain is going to bat for Joe Biden, lending her voice to a video set to air during Tuesday night’s Democratic National Convention programming focused on Biden’s close friendship with her late husband, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona.  She’s just the latest Republican to join in the convention, after a number of notable GOP former elected officials — including former Ohio Gov. John Kasich — endorsed the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee on Monday night. It’s a continuation of a major theme that Democrats have pushed through the first night of the convention — an effort to broaden the party’s appeal to occasional Republicans and disaffected Trump voters.  My husband and Vice President Biden enjoyed a 30+ year friendship dating back to before their years serving together in the Senate, so I was honored to accept the invitation from the Biden campaign to participate in a video celebrating their relationship.https://t.co/Y6XOnBC1IW — Cindy McCain (@cindymccain) August 18, 2020  In an advance clip from the video shared with The Associated Press, Cindy McCain talks about how Biden, then a Delaware senator, met her husband when John McCain was assigned to be a military aide for him on a trip overseas. The two became friends, and the families would gather for picnics in the Bidens’ backyard.  “They would just sit and joke. It was like a comedy show, sometimes, to watch the two of them,” she says in the clip.  Cindy McCain is not expected to offer an explicit endorsement, but her involvement in the video is her biggest public show of support yet for Biden’s candidacy. McCain was the 2008 Republican presidential nominee against Democrat Barack Obama, who won the election with Biden as his vice presidential running mate.

Trump targeted John McCain personally in 2015, saying the former prisoner of war wasn’t a hero “because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.” McCain later angered Trump with his dramatic thumbs-down vote against repealing President Barack Obama’s health care law.  When McCain died on a Saturday in 2018, the Trump administration lowered the American flag over the White House to half-staff but then raised it by Monday. After public outcry, the White House flags were again lowered. Trump wasn’t invite to McCain’s funeral.  Biden consoled Meghan McCain on an appearance on “The View” after her father was diagnosed with the cancer that eventually took his life. She has said Biden often reaches out to her to offer support, after losing his own son Beau to the same cancer in 2015.  But while Meghan suggested in April she’d be voting for Biden, Cindy has pointedly stayed out of the presidential race. In April of last year, amid rumors that the McCains would wade into the election in support of Biden, Cindy McCain tweeted that Biden is “a wonderful man and a dear friend of the McCain family.”  “However,” she added at the time, “I have no intention of getting involved in presidential politics.”  The video on Biden’s friendship with McCain is one of a series of short documentaries created by Oscar Award-winning director Davis Guggenheim, who worked on “An Inconvenient Truth,” the 2006 documentary on climate change that featured former Vice President Al Gore. On Monday night, Guggenheim’s short film focused on Biden’s relationship with the Amtrak conductor and workers on the trains he took from Delaware to Washington as senator aired during the convention.

(AP) - Republican Florida Ron DeSantis signed a slew of environmental bills in less than 24 hours that address issues ranging from sea level rise to blue-green algae blooms - and even given the state authority to use drones to fight invasive Burmese pythons.  DeSantis signed a 77-page bill Tuesday that will addresses leaky septic tanks, municipal wastewater treatment, stormwater runoff, farm fertilizers and more, as well as a companion measure that will better track sources of pollutants that are blamed for mucking up the state’s waterways.  That comes after he signed a bill late Monday night requiring public coastal construction projects to first be reviewed for impacts on the state’s fragile seashore because of rising sea levels. Among other bills signed Monday is a measure that will ban the sale, trading, bartering, possession or breeding of iguanas, which have become a common sight and scourge in the southern part of Florida.  “A huge component of this is dealing with these wastewater discharges,” DeSantis said of the bill signed Tuesday that was based on recommendations of a task force he formed to address algae blooms.  Algae blooms in Florida rivers and other waterways have killed fish, irritated eyes and have shut down fishing, swimming, boating and other activities in a state where water resources are a huge tourist draw.  The new law seeks to better regulate onsite sewage treatment, upgrade leaky utility water lines and better manage farm fertilizers that wash into state waterways. It also gives the Department of Environmental Protection more authority in managing the issues.  Fines against municipalities for sewage discharges will also be increased.  “Many wastewater treatment systems in Florida are poorly maintained and the network of pipes supporting them have fallen into disrepair,” DeSantis said. “Even relatively moderate rain events can cause a system to be flooded, forcing a discharge of raw sewage into waterways and estuaries.”  Still, some environmentalists think the legislation didn’t go far enough.  Sierra Club lobbyist said in a statement emailed to media that the law “is all promise and no delivery. It preserves the Florida status quo: pretend that the requirements in law are working when they’re not.”  One of the bills DeSantis signed Monday acknowledges that climate change is a growing concern. The new law will require public coastal construction projects to first be reviewed for impacts on the state’s fragile seashore because of rising sea levels.  The signing was hailed by environmentalists as a step in addressing the encroaching ocean in a state with more than 1,300 miles of shoreline and where two-thirds of the 22 million residents live along the coast.  The bipartisan bill DeSantis signed on coastal construction is limited to public projects that rely on state money.  Public construction projects will have to take into account rising sea levels, flooding and the potential for damage to increasingly fragile coasts.  “The delicate relationship between our coastal communities and the environment requires that our Legislature take meaningful steps to ensure that coastal construction be completed with an understanding of sea level rise,” said state Rep. Vance Aloupis, a Miami Republican.  Sen. Jose Javier Rodriguez, a Miami Democrat who has been wearing rain boots during recent legislative sessions to bring attention to climate change, carried the legislation in the Senate.  “Requiring planning when state taxpayer dollars are spent on infrastructure in the coastal zone is a necessary and long overdue initial step in addressing the impacts of climate,” Rodriguez said.  Rodriguez has said the measure is another baby step in a political climate that has made it challenging to take quick action on climate change.  A legislative analysis estimated that property values in Florida could sink by more than $300 billion by the end of this century because of rising sea levels.  DeSantis also signed a bill that will allow allow the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the Florida Forest Service to fly drones to manage and eradicate invasive species on public lands. Part of the goal is to use new technology to identify pythons from the sky in hopes of helping the fight to hunt them down in the Everglades.  Another new law makes it illegal to possess, import, barter, trade, sell or breed green iguanas and tegu lizards. People who currently have a license to breed the reptiles would be grandfathered in under the bill but could only sell the lizards to customers in other states.

This is part of where the Hayman fire — until last month, Colorado's largest in recorded history — burned northwest of Colorado Springs back in 2002. The ground is dry, crunching underfoot.  \"What we're seeing is a very large high-severity burn patch, where the vast majority of the trees have died,\" says Chambers, with the Colorado Forest Restoration Institute at Colorado State University.  These 18-square miles burned hot and fast in a single day, driven by how dense the forest was because of past fire suppression, high winds and extreme drought. Now, nearly two decades later, something you'd normally see after a wildfire is missing: new trees.  \"Some regeneration may be occurring, but certainly not enough to recreate a forest in the near term,\" Chambers says. She and her colleagues have found that forests are struggling to grow back some of the state's most iconic species, like ponderosa pine and Douglas fir.  High-severity fires leave behind massive burn areas with almost nothing alive. And any baby trees simply can't thrive in the increased heat and drought brought on by climate change.  \"Imagine being a ponderosa pine seed trying to grow out here,\" Chambers says. \"It's a pretty intense environment.\"  If there is forest regeneration, Chambers says it happens in bands along the forest edge, where surviving trees can still drop their seeds. But she says even that isn't happening at lower elevations, where it's hotter and drier. She's not sure this area of the Hayman fire will ever reforest.  A new study led by the University of Colorado Boulder also finds large parts of the Southern Rocky Mountains will become unsuitable for ponderosa pine and Douglas fir tree regrowth as the climate continues to warm.  Lead author Kyle Rodman and his team found a stark dividing line, with very little regrowth after the 2000 Walker Ranch Fire near Boulder. The year 2002, Rodman says, \"was one of the driest years we've had in the past century or more. So any seedlings that might have established right after the fire, there's a good chance they would have been cooked in that drought.\"  Forests become grasslands, and that's bad for carbon emissions  For areas that can't regenerate, research has found they may instead convert to grasslands.  Camille Stevens-Rumann, also of Colorado State University, says there can be lots of benefits to having patches of grasslands between forested areas. But it's a problem \"where we're talking about tens of thousands of acres that have transitioned from forest to grasslands.\"  One major concern is that trees sequester carbon. Fewer trees will capture less carbon, which means more warming, and therefore fewer trees, in a cycle that will make it hard to reach carbon neutrality.  Thomas Veblen, of the University of Colorado Boulder, says this poses a problem for tree replanting efforts touted as a way to combat climate change.  \"Trees need moisture to survive, and they simply are not going to be surviving in the many, many places where we would like to have them planted and sequestering carbon,\" he says.  Stevens-Rumann has studied a large range of burned forests across the West and found some areas no longer able to support the same trees that have been there for one or two centuries.  \"We're really moving away from the suitable climate for tree regeneration to happen,\" she says.  But she wants to emphasize that Colorado is not losing all of its forests.  Some trees, like aspen and oak, do better with regrowth after a fire. She says lodgepole pine forests, such as what's been burning in the Cameron Peak Fire north of Rocky Mountain National Park, have also been found to recover better than some lower-elevation trees. Fire actually makes their cones open to drop seeds.  In other cases, a different species may move in, or trees may migrate to higher, cooler elevations.  \"That gives me hope for these landscapes,\" she says. \"And I think part of what we all have to accept, in this new and changing world, is that these ecosystems are going to look different than the ones that maybe we have grown fond of in the past.\"  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 8, "joy": 8, "negative": 10, "disgust": 1, "positive": 6, "anger": 8, "surprise": 1, "fear": 9, "trust": 4}, "metadata": ["chambers", "colorado", "institute", "state's", "fires", "drought", "climate", "university", "southern", "stark", "emissions", "tens", "capture"]}, {"text": "TAHLEQUAH, Okla. (AP) \" It isn't easy being a Bernie Sanders supporter in a conservative state like Oklahoma. Travis Wyman, a 40-year-old construction worker and online 'social justice warrior,' says he and other Sanders fans can hear 'fear-mongering words' like socialist and communist thrown at them many times a day.  It's done nothing to deter Wyman, who volunteers for Sanders' presidential campaign at phone banks and was among roughly 200 people who turned out to hear the candidate's wife, Jane Sanders, speak last week in Tahlequah, an eastern Oklahoma city and home to the Cherokee Nation, the largest Native American tribe in the country.  'Man, this is a revolution. We're here to change the world. There's only one way to do that, and that's to be active,\" said Wyman, a Cherokee Nation citizen who had never voted for any presidential candidate before he cast an early vote for the self-described democratic socialist on Thursday, days before Oklahoma holds its primary.  If places like Oklahoma are tough for the Sanders faithful, it would seem to be even rougher territory for Sanders himself. The state and others like it \" solidly conservative places like Utah, Alabama, Arkansas and Texas __ overwhelmingly supported Donald Trump in 2016. Republicans dominate politics at almost all levels, and successful Democratic candidates usually reject ideas embraced by progressives like Sanders, such as 'Medicare for All.'  But these states, which make up roughly half of those voting in the Super Tuesday contests and where Democrats often are further to the left, are also providing an opportunity \" unexpected as it may seem \" for the front-runner for the 2020 Democratic nomination to run up the score on his more moderate opponents.  A progressive on the campaign trail \" particularly one who has an actual chance of winning \" is such a rare sight that Sanders' candidacy is energizing a core base of progressives who are hungry for a chance to support someone who shares their values. And because the total Democratic primary electorate is small and a half dozen or so other candidates are splitting the more moderate vote, Sanders can scoop up delegates with even a modest showing at the polls.  Sanders leads the delegate count heading into Tuesday, after essentially tying former Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg in Iowa then winning New Hampshire and Nevada. He came in second in South Carolina on Saturday, behind former Vice President Joe Biden.  Some of these smaller red states have been friendly to Sanders before. He easily won both Oklahoma and Utah in 2016, garnering almost 80% of the vote in the Utah caucuses over Hillary Clinton, who didn't hold any public events before the late March vote. Sanders held a Salt Lake City rally before the caucuses that was so large, he scheduled another one days later.  University of Utah political science professor Matthew Burbank saw the enthusiasm firsthand when he returned home on caucus night to find all the parking spots on his street near a caucus site were taken.  'I think progressives in the party said, 'This is our chance,'' he said. 'There was a sense of 'he's one of us.''  But this time around his more moderate rivals also have been working to win the state, where Republicans outnumber Democrats more than three to one but there's also a significant slice of the voters who aren't affiliated with either party. There's also an undercurrent of discomfort with Trump because of his brash style, his history with women and disagreements over the treatment of immigrants and refugees. Utah is welcoming to them, in part because members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which is based in the state, were historically driven across the country because of their beliefs and because the faith now has strong growth overseas.  Buttigieg and former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, a billionaire who has spent millions on TV ads leading up to his Super Tuesday debut, are hoping those voters will turn out for them in the Democratic primary. Buttigieg has racked up endorsements from several politicians in and around the liberal-leaning capital of Salt Lake City. Bloomberg, meanwhile, counts the state's lone congressional Democrat, Ben McAdams, among his supporters. He's also built the state's largest campaign staff.  Sanders' positions on issues like climate change are especially resonant in Utah, where skiers and other outdoors people worry about wildfires and snow pack, Burbank said. Sanders is scheduled to campaign there Monday.  Rachel Frost, 38, a real estate appraiser from Murray, Utah, said she's settled on Sanders because he's been consistent for decades on policy, even when he wasn't taken seriously.  'He may not be the most likable person, but I don't need to get a beer with the president. I need someone whose policies will help a majority of the people,' she said.  Sanders' success in this year's primaries has been in his ability to expand his coalition to include African Americans, Latinos and others in addition to white working people. In Oklahoma, that's meant building support among Native Americans who make up about 9% of the state's population. Last fall, Sanders attended the largest annual gathering of the Comanche Nation in the state, where he participated in the annual powwow. On Thursday, the event with Jane Sanders opened with a Kiowa Flag Song and a traditional Cherokee-language prayer.  Sanders' message of ending inequality and providing health care as a human right resonates with Native Americans like Pam Edgar, a Creek Nation citizen from Tahlequah. So does his commitment to tribal sovereignty, which includes opposing opening tribal lands to mining.  'Being a tribal member, we have the good fortune of having health care for tribal members, so we don't have to worry about costs, and having that for all citizens is important,\" said Edgar, 45.  Sanders' relationship with Oklahoma's tribes also serves as a reminder of rival Elizabeth Warren's own sensitive history in her home state. Warren has apologized to Native Americans after she was criticized for releasing a DNA test meant to bolster her claim to Native American heritage.  Before Jane Sanders' visit to Tahlequah she visited the Black Wall Street Chamber of Commerce in Tulsa's historic Greenwood District, where a race massacre 100 years ago left an estimated 300 of the city's black residents dead and its thriving black community in rubble. At a souvenir shop, Cleo Harris Jr. sold her a Black Wall Street T-shirt and said he's considering supporting Sanders on Tuesday, noting the 78-year-old was active in the civil rights movement alongside Martin Luther King Jr.  Jane Sanders also spent her time during a trip to Nashville, Tennessee, earlier in the week visiting the city's more racially and culturally diverse neighborhoods. She told The Associated Press that while Tennessee is a more conservative state, it's also 'a working-class state,' which plays to her husband's strengths.  Sanders' campaign has employed five staffers and purchased its first television ad in the state last week. It's unknown how much support he'll have in a state where Clinton got 66% of the primary vote in 2016.  Brooke Madow, 39, was one of a few dozen people who packed into a modest Nashville coffee shop on Wednesday to see Jane Sanders. Having a chronic, autoimmune disease has made Sanders' trademark Medicare for All a top issue for her, Madow said.  Like Wyman, she said being a progressive in a conservative state can be isolating, but attending Sanders campaign events helps.  'It feels a little crushing at times, but I think coming to things like this make me feel less like I'm living in a red state,\" she said. \"Maybe there are more people like me out there who believe in the things I believe in.'   ___  Burnett reported from Chicago.

The new rule, from the Environmental Protection Agency and Transportation Department, will almost immediately be plunged into litigation as environmental groups and states with stricter standards, led by California, plan to challenge it. If the administration’s policy survives those fights, it would spare automakers from having to meet ambitious gas mileage and emissions requirements put in place in 2012 under President Obama. It is among the biggest steps the administration has taken to reverse an existing environmental policy.  The proposal is a dialed-down version of the one the administration originally planned. Instead of proposing zero improvements in fuel efficiency in coming years, it would require automakers to increase fuel economy across their fleets by 1.5% a year, with a goal of achieving an average of 40 miles per gallon by 2026. That’s still a major departure from current rules, which mandate annual increases of 5%, reaching an average of 54 mpg by 2025. “We are delivering on President Trump’s promise to correct the current fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards,” EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement. The administration’s plan, he said, “strikes the right regulatory balance that protects our environment and sets reasonable targets for the auto industry.”  As you can imagine, Obama was not happy with this and took a shot at Trump over the coronavirus pandemic:  We’ve seen all too terribly the consequences of those who denied warnings of a pandemic.

WASHINGTON — The Trump Administration wants to change the definition of a showerhead to let more water flow, addressing a pet peeve of the president who complains he isn't getting wet enough.  Publicly talking about the need to keep his hair “perfect,” President Donald Trump has made increasing water flow and dialing back long held appliance conservation standards — from light bulbs to toilets to dishwashers — a personal issue.  But consumer and conservation groups said the Department of Energy’s proposed loosening of a 28-year-old energy law that includes appliance standards is silly, unnecessary and wasteful, especially as the West bakes through a historic two-decade-long megadrought.  Since 1992, federal law has dictated that new showerheads shouldn’t pour more than 2.5 gallons of water per minute (9.5 liters). As newer shower fixtures came out with multiple nozzles, the Obama administration defined the showerhead restrictions to apply to what comes out in total. So if there are four nozzles, no more than 2.5 gallons total should come out between all four.  The new proposal Wednesday would allow each nozzle to spray as much as 2.5 gallons, not just the overall showerhead.  With four or five or more nozzles, “you could have 10, 15 gallons per minute powering out of the showerhead, literally probably washing you out of the bathroom,” said Andrew deLaski, executive director of the energy conservation group Appliance Standards Awareness Project.  On the White House South Lawn in July, Trump made the issue personal:  “So showerheads — you take a shower, the water doesn’t come out. You want to wash your hands, the water doesn’t come out. So what do you do? You just stand there longer or you take a shower longer? Because my hair — I don’t know about you, but it has to be perfect. Perfect.\"  DeLaski and officials at Consumer Reports said there’s been no public outcry or need for change. The Department of Energy’s own database of 12,499 showerheads showed 74% of them use two gallons or less water per minute, which is 20% less than the federal standard.  “Frankly it’s silly,” deLaski said. “The country faces serious problems. We’ve got a pandemic, serious long-term drought throughout much of the West. We’ve got global climate change. Showerheads aren’t one of our problems.”  Energy Department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said the 2013 Obama definition of showerhead clashes with what Congress intended and the standards of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.  If the rule is adopted, Hynes said it would be “allowing Americans — not Washington bureaucrats — to choose what kind of showerheads they have in their homes.”  Officials at the industry group Plumbing Manufacturers International did not respond to a request for comment.  Appliance and plumbing energy and water conservation standards save consumers about $500 a year on energy bills, deLaski said.  If people are having trouble getting water flowing in their shower, they should check their home’s water pressure and can replace a faulty showerhead for not much money, deLaski said.  A 2016 test of showerheads by Consumer Reports found that the best rated showerheads — including a $20 model — provided a pleasing amount of water flow and met federal standards, according to David Friedman, a Consumer Reports vice president and former acting assistant energy secretary.  DeLaski said he has had a hard time understanding the president’s shower concerns.  “If the president needs help finding a good shower, we can point him to some great consumer websites that help you identify a good showerhead that provides a dense soak and a good shower,” deLaski said.

Julie Payette waves as she waits prior to delivering the throne speech in the Senate chamber in Ottawa on Sept. 23, 2020. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)  Libs Unveil Sweeping Plan for Current and Future Challenges  OTTAWA—The minority Liberal government has unveiled what it calls an “ambitious plan for an unprecedented reality” that pledges to create over one million jobs and massively expand or introduce benefit programs and support for nearly every sector of society.  The Conservatives immediately responded by saying they would not support the plan and the Bloc Quebecois said it proposes too many intrusions into provincial jurisdiction, likely leaving the fate of the minority Liberal government in the hands of Jagmeet Singh and the New Democrats.  While Wednesday’s throne speech signals that the Liberals intend to follow through on promised efforts to combat climate change, economic inequality and systemic racism, they’re also acknowledging that not much can be done if the COVID-19 pandemic is not brought under control.  “We must address these challenges of today. But we also cannot forget about the tests of the future,” said the text of the speech, read in the Senate by Gov. Gen. Julie Payette.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was sitting a few metres away, wearing a mask, one of just a handful of people inside the chamber due to restrictions linked to COVID-19.  Public health officials have increasingly sounded the alarm in recent days that if stricter controls aren’t in place or enforced, a full-blown second wave of the pandemic risks taking over the country, which could, if stronger lockdowns are needed, end up drowning the economy. Case counts in some areas are now at highs not seen since the early days of the pandemic.  The Liberals promised Wednesday they’ll do what they can to help, including creating a federal “testing assistance response team” to meet surge demand, and targeted support to businesses forced to close due to local public health orders.  With millions of Canadians lives and livelihoods still teetering after the pandemic’s first wave, the Liberals promised to move ahead with a shift from emergency benefits to a more robust employment insurance system to incorporate COVID-19 supports. They’ve also reversed course on a planned end to the federal wage subsidy program, now saying they’ll extend it into next year.  The immediate goals of the government to restart the economy and support Canadians are matched by the need of the minority Liberals to stay in power.  The eventual vote on the throne speech is a confidence motion and they need at least one of the three main opposition parties in the Commons to back their plan.  Trudeau is scheduled to address Canadians in a nationally televised speech later Wednesday, a move designed to underscore the ongoing severity of the pandemic, but one his political rivals have argued is a political stunt and lends credence to the idea of the throne speech as the Liberals’ platform for the next election.  Payette’s words were still hanging in air Wednesday as the Conservatives immediately ruled out supporting the speech.  Conservative deputy leader Candice Bergen said the speech takes an “Ottawa-knows-best” approach rather than listening to what the people actually want.  Ahead of the speech, the NDP had been agitating for the government to step in more and address the gaps in the existing emergency benefits program and EI system, but didn’t get their wished-for extension of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.  They may, however, take some comfort in a pledge in the speech to move forward with elements of a national pharmacare plan, which is also one of their policy planks.  That pitch is part of a broad suite of ideas the Liberals are laying out for the post-pandemic period, through what they’re calling a “resiliency agenda.”  Other parts of that package: national standards for long-term care homes, robust investments in national child care, a new Canadian disability benefit regime and “full and fair compensation” for farmers for recent trade agreements. There are also promises for tougher gun laws, action to address systemic racism in the justice system and elsewhere and a refreshed list of promises to Indigenous Peoples.  Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet, currently in isolation due to COVID-19, said the federal government’s ambition strays too far onto provincial turf.  “Ottawa has not listened to the urgent and legitimate demands of Quebec and the provinces, ” he said in French on social media.  The cornerstone of the plan for the future, the Liberals say, will be action to tackle climate change, which will include legislation to get to Canada’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 and investments to attract the development of net-zero technology.  The federal Conservatives, who had said before the speech they’d like to see some measure of fiscal restraint included after months of unchecked spending, also saw those demands unmet.  “This is not the time for austerity,” the speech says.  “Canadians should not have to choose between health and their job, just like Canadians should not have to take on debt that their government can better shoulder.”  The Liberals do hint, however, that the taps won’t run forever, promising they will be guided by “values of sustainability and prudence.” They say they will provide a fiscal update in the fall.  They are also promising some new sources of revenue, including looking for ways to tax “extreme wealth inequality,” and addressing digital giants perceived not to be paying their fair share of taxes.  The promises come with no firm price tags, nor many specific timelines.  “Taken together, this is an ambitious plan for an unprecedented reality,” it says.  “The course of events will determine what needs to be done when. But throughout, protecting and supporting Canadians will stay the top priority.”   By Stephanie Levitz  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 21, "positive": 43, "negative": 10, "joy": 3, "anger": 9, "surprise": 3, "fear": 14, "trust": 10}, "metadata": ["senate", "unveil", "sweeping", "challenges", "unprecedented", "pledges", "sector", "liberals", "climate", "economic", "inequality", "pandemic", "minister", "stricter", "risks", "surge", "economy", "ongoing", "conservative", "leader", "canada", "calling", "investments", "child", "racism", "indigenous", "tackle", "emissions", "debt", "wealth", "addressing", "digital", "giants", "perceived", "ambitious", "protecting"]}, {"text": "Actor John Cusack sounded the alarm on climate change and “predatory capitalism” while introducing presidential primary contender Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., during a Saturday afternoon rally in Exeter, New Hampshire.

Posted in Latest news  In honor of “Climate Week,” New York City is playing host to a massive “Climate Clock” purporting to count down the years, days, and minutes until the world reaches a climate catastrophe point-of-no-return.  The oversized digital display, on view through Sept. 27, underscores a long history of climate doomsayers prematurely warning that a global climate tipping point is just a few short years away.  The digital clockface itself has been a fixture of New York City’s Union Square for over 20 years.  A landmark that has confused many tourists to the city, the clock’s display normally denotes, in one long, unbroken string of digits, the current time of day (in military time) as well as the remaining number of hours and minutes left in the day itself.  Over the weekend, the clock instead began a straightforward countdown, one ticking off seven years and several dozen days, after which — according to the project’s creators, artists Gan Golan and Andrew Boyd — the Earth will have used up its “carbon budget” and will careen toward irreversible climate catastrophe.  The artists said the countdown was based on the calculations put forth by the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change, one that purports to measure the amount of time humanity has to reduce its carbon output to stay below the 1.5° Celsius warming threshold.  The clock “shows how little time is left for political decision-makers to take action,” the MRI says on its website.  Several decades of constantly shifting climate countdowns  The “Climate Clock” generated headlines across the world for its novelty and striking presentation of what activists claim is a final deadline before global temperatures reach a point from which there is no turning back.  Yet such prophecies are nothing new from climate scientists and activists, who have repeatedly warned the world over recent decades that it was very near the point of no return regarding carbon emissions.  Among the earliest such warnings was one from Noel Brown, who in 1989 led the U.N. Environment Program in New York.  In that year, Brown warned that “entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000,” as a contemporary Associated Press report put it.  Brown said that scientists at that time were warning that there was “nothing” the world could do at that point to reverse a three-degree rise in temperatures.  “Anything beyond that,” he told the news service, “and we have to start thinking about the significant rise of the sea levels … we can expect more ferocious storms, hurricanes, wind shear, dust erosion.”  Many scientists have since extended the deadline for climate change redemption by years and even decades beyond Brown’s 2000 cutoff.  In 2006, for example, Columbia climate science professor James Hansen predicted that the planet had just 10 years to avoid major catastrophes.  “I think we have a very brief window of opportunity to deal with climate change,” he told the Climate Change Research Conference that year, stating that the planet had “no longer than a decade, at the most” to reverse catastrophic warming across the globe.  In 2008, Al Gore said in a speech that “leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis.”  That same year, Australian scientist Tim Flannery argued that a United Nations climate summit in Poland that year was “likely to be our last chance as a species to deal with the problem.”  The following year, in 2009, then-United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warned at the U.N. Climate Change Summit Plenary that the world would soon reach “critical thresholds,” incurring “consequences that we cannot reverse.”  “The world’s leading scientists warn that we have less than 10 years to avoid the worst-case scenarios projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,” he said at the time.  That same year, the U.K.’s Prince Charles argued that the world had just eight years to avoid “irretrievable climate and ecosystem collapse, and all that goes with it.”  In 2018, meanwhile, current U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres extended Ki-moon’s earlier cut-off by another year, warning in a speech that the U.S. had until 2020 to change course, after which “we risk missing the point where we can avoid runaway climate change.”  More recently, climate activists have pushed the deadline out significantly further than earlier predictions, well past those of Ki-moon and Guterres.  New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for instance, famously suggested last year that “the world is gonna end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change.”  Also last year, Swedish environmentalist activist Greta Thunberg claimed that the world had 11 years to enact “permanent and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society” or else humanity would witness “the end of our civilization as we know it.”  Read more at Just The News  Be Social And Share!

Now there’s talk that she could be tapped as a presidential candidate. Again. The Democratic Party may have some thinking to do.  “Who are the alternatives? All the supposed moderates — Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bloomberg — were thoroughly rejected by primary voters. The prickly Elizabeth Warren finished third in her home state. All of which leaves Clinton as the best backup plan,” writes New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin.  “She’s hardly my cup of tea but for all her problems, including doubts about her physical stamina, she is a fundraising machine, has a true following and could hit the ground running. And, in case you hadn’t noticed, she’s advertising her availability,” Mr. Goodwin continues.  “It’s surely no coincidence that ‘Hillary’ was released Friday, during the height of the primary season. The sweetheart documentary, complete with broad promotion, stories, reviews and interviews with her, is a massive and slick selling job. Once again and always, she is selling herself,” Mr. Goodwin notes.  “While it’s impossible to miss the rollout and her glee in using the film and interviews to stick knives into Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, it’s also impossible to miss the timing. All the party has to do is call. Her bag is packed,” the columnist advises.  BIDEN’S ALREADY PICKED HIS CABINET  A new report suggests that Democratic presidential hopeful Joseph R. Biden is already picking out favorites for a future Cabinet and White House staff. The former vice president’s list includes a host of ex-Obama administration heavyweights and even former campaign-trail foes.  Mr. Biden’s choices include Sen. Elizabeth Warren as Treasury secretary or running mate, and former Secretary of State John Kerry in a newly created Cabinet position to oversee climate change. Susan Rice — an Obama-era national security adviser — would be tapped as secretary of state and Michael R. Bloomberg as head of the World Bank. Pete Buttigieg could emerge as ambassador to the United Nations.  The possibilities of “Biden’s secret governing plan” are outlined in a new report issued Monday by Axios.  “The bottom line: Biden, a throw-back institutionalist, relishes an emphasis on governing, norms and restoring alliances. That includes respect for experts, and for the art and science of governing. This evolving plan is all in Biden’s comfort zone — all meant to send a public signal of stability,” noted the report, which was written by Axios founders Jim VandeHei and Mike Allen.

Voters in Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington state go to the polls on Tuesday.  “Some analysts are calling it Super Tuesday 2, or Mini-Super Tuesday,” writes Nate Ashworth, editor of Election Central.  “Whatever you call it, there are more states voting in the Democratic primary. Out of the six, there has been some polling done very recently that indicates former Vice President Joe Biden is favored in four of them, while the two northwestern states of Idaho and North Dakota could be fertile for Bernie Sanders like they were in 2016,” he says.  “In the end, a good night for Biden would be a victory in four, maybe five states, which would give him a noteworthy delegate haul. If Bernie can win Idaho, North Dakota, and then come out with a win in Washington, that would at least giving him a strong argument to press on toward the next Democratic debate on March 15,” Mr. Ashworth advises.  CORONAVIRUS HITS THE PRESS CORPS  The world’s largest gathering of conservatives has had an unintended consequence. After a single attendee at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference — CPAC — tested positive for the mystery virus, news organizations have begun quarantine procedures for reporters who attended the event.  “Politico, The Washington Post, The Daily Beast, and Mother Jones have asked reporters who covered CPAC to self-quarantine and work remotely due to concerns that they may have been exposed to the novel coronavirus,” said a report from The Washingtonian, a news organization based in the nation’s capital.  “Both the Post and Politico say they’ve taken measures to clean and sanitize public areas. The Post has asked employees who were at CPAC to self-quarantine for seven days. All newsrooms tell Washingtonian they’ve taken such measures out of an abundance of caution.”  The American Conservative Union — host organization to the mammoth gathering — has already issued two comprehensive advisories for concerned attendees.  “We continue to remain in close contact with the infected individual and he continues to be doing better. Also, at this point, no other CPAC attendee, participant or staff has tested positive for coronavirus,” the organization advised Monday.   THE REAL PAPER TRAIL  Arriving Tuesday from Scribner: “The Hunt for History: On the Trail of the World’s Lost Treasuresfrom the Letters of Lincoln, Churchill, and Einstein to the Secret Recordings Onboard JFK’s Air Force One” by Nathan Raab, a meticulous and discerning rare documents dealer who’s seen it all — from Amelia Earhart’s flight logs to the letters of President Ronald Reagan, and an unpublished missive written by Albert Einstein discussing his theory of relativity.  The author’s work combines art, science and good business all in one — the details revealed in his new book.  Mr. Raab describes himself as the “Sherlock Holmes of historical artifacts — questing after precious finds and determining their authenticity.”   POLL DU JOUR  • 85% of Americans are “not concerned” about losing their job in the next 12 months.  • 56% say their household income is the same as it was 12 months ago; 32% say their household income is “significantly higher.”  • 67% say it’s a “good time” to sell a house; 22% say it is a “bad time” to sell.  • 59% say it’s a “good time” to buy a house; 32% say it is a “bad time” to buy.

The effort, according to Axios, is being spearheaded by House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., alongside Reps. Garret Graves, R-La., and Bruce Westerman R-Ark. McCarthy held a caucus event on climate change Thursday, and appears to be taking action that counters critics who believe the GOP is not concerned with environmental issues.  AOC DOUBTS TRUMP WILL TAKE ON FOSSIL FUEL FIRMS: 'I THINK HE'S IN THEIR POCKET'  \"If you look at this conference today, we just had a whole event talking about the environment, not because someone is driving us but because we care about it,\" he told Axios.  The proposed policies reportedly focus on three particular efforts. The first is the capturing of carbon dioxide emissions. Part of this includes what is being called the Trillion Trees Act, whereby legislation would look to increase the number of trees in the U.S., with the goal of using them for \"sequestering\" carbon. The congressmen are also looking to expand tax credits for companies that capture and store carbon dioxide.  The plan does not include emissions targets that are favored by Democrats. Graves claimed that setting \"arbitrary targets\" would be \"a mistake.\"  The second part of the plan is the promotion of clean energy technology by doubling investment in clean air research and lowering taxes for companies that export clean air tech. Nuclear power and natural gas are also featured in the plan.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The third area of focus is conservation, especially when it comes to plastic. This includes cleaning up pollution from plastic, urging government labs to develop improved recycling methods, and directing foreign aid to nations whose rivers suffer the most from plastic pollution.  The Green New Deal, pushed by lawmakers including Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., takes a more far-reaching approach, with Sanders calling for a \"wholesale transformation of our society\" in which transportation and the economy are overhauled.

Launched in 2019, the program means to leverage the power of science to pioneer tangible solutions to the most pressing environmental problems facing our communities and our planet.  The inaugural cohort of 32 undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers is already making an impact with projects including research on how to improve the design of mobile apps to help African farmers gain access to data that better protects their livelihoods and environment; and insights on the type of corals most vulnerable to coral bleaching to aid coral management in a rapidly warming ocean.  With support from philanthropists Wendy Schmidt and her husband, Eric, through The Schmidt Family Foundation, the fellows program was established in response to a significant reduction in federal funding available to doctoral students in environmental and ecological science.  The Schmidt Environmental Solutions Fellowship also provides funds for early career Ph.D. students at UCSB and for undergraduate students to partner with those same doctoral students to conduct research in the laboratory or in the field. The new funding commitment follows the success of the first cohort.  “The insights we gain from environmentally focused research and the technology development that accompanies it can help to restore our earth and ocean systems and provide opportunities on a global scale,” said Wendy Schmidt, president and co-founder of The Schmidt Family Foundation and co-founder of Schmidt Ocean Institute.  “I am encouraged by the achievements of these students and eager to see the impact of the next cohort,\" she said. \"This next generation of students are leading a smart path forward to a healthy and prosperous planet.”  Douglas McCauley, an associate professor in UCSB’s Marine Science Institute, oversees the fellowship program. He said he is especially pleased with the program’s extension amidst a global pandemic that further highlights the need for good science to solve the grand challenges facing the planet and humanity.  “The timing of this renewal of the Schmidt Environmental Solutions Fellows program could not have been better,” McCauley said. “While COVID-19 has created significant new challenges for UCSB researchers, the threats facing our environment and affecting our well-being have not gone away.”  According to McCauley, an explicit aim of the 2020 Environmental Fellows Program is to provide financial support for students and researchers on campus to quickly adapt, in the face of COVID-19, to new research approaches and even new questions — pivoting, for example, from international summer field research to developing new techniques for using satellites to remotely study their ecosystems.  “A silver lining is that this funding is empowering our students to develop some exciting and novel digital research techniques that are helping us remotely study our planet,\" he said. “This new toolkit seems likely to transform the way we do environmental problem-solving in ways that create value well beyond the COVID-19 era.”  The diverse 2020 cohort of Schmidt Environmental Solutions Fellows is tackling a wide range of pressing topics, from climate change to light pollution.  Like previous fellows, the students will share their discoveries in a series of open community fora and receive intensive training in science communication increasing their abilities to share results with policy makers and communities.

During a “60 Minutes” interview, he unleashed a nonsense word salad when pressed to explain how he would pay for all of his socialist policy ideas. Details apparently irritate Mr. Sanders, like they do the left in general. This is a crowd used to selling snake oil on the side of the road; the last thing they want to do is tell you what’s actually in it.  The Fiscal Times reported, “Sen. Bernie Sanders didn’t want to get into any details when pressed about the price tag for his ambitious agenda. He said his Medicare-for-All plan would cost about $30 trillion over 10 years, which would, he argues, cost ‘substantially less than letting the current system go.’ Asked about a total price tag for his entire agenda — which includes free public college, cancellation of all student debt and a Green New Deal to tackle climate change — Sanders said he doesn’t have a total cost figure. …”  During that same interview, Mr. Sanders doubled down on earlier praise for the totalitarian Castro regime in Cuba by insisting that not everything was bad because the tyrant implemented a “literacy program.”  He was rightly torched on social and other media, with Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida tweeting, “Likely Dem nominee praised the supposed ‘achievements’ Castro regime. And he’s wrong about why people didn’t overthrow Castro. It’s not because ‘he educated their kids, gave them health care’ it’s because his opponents were jailed, murdered or exiled.”  With all history has taught us, one can wonder what compels an adult American to make excuses for murderous regimes while running for president promoting economic schemes that even he has no idea how they would be implemented, let alone paid for.  But funding madness isn’t the issue; the question is what sort of person thinks so little of the normals that they promote schemes that would destroy the nation’s economy while making Venezuela look like an appealing all-inclusive resort.  This is at the heart of what drives socialism — the notion that people can’t be trusted, are dumb and therefore must be controlled at all cost. This retrograde attitude about the power and value of humanity doesn’t just manifest in politics — if you look closely enough, you see rancid elitism informing socialists and communists throughout history. Malignant elitists selling socialism as a cure for malignant elitism has got to be the most successful con game in the 20th and now 21st centuries.  Mr. Sanders is now the torchbearer for the same con that has destroyed countries and cost more than 100 million lives in the modern era.  How little does one have to think about humanity in order to promote a theory that condemns the individual to be a mindless cog in a socialist system? (Warning: the following descriptions may offend some readers). More recently, a senior adviser to former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, another Democratic presidential candidate, mentioned Mr. Sanders‘ “loopy” history to CNN host Alisyn Camerota. The Washington Examiner reported:  “[Senior advisor to the Bloomberg campaign Tim] O’Brien also condemned some of Sanders‘ academic writings from the 1970s, in which he covered topics such as rape and sexuality. In one 1972 article, Sanders wrote that women ‘fantasize’ about being raped. O’Brien argued that Sanders needed to address his ‘loopy’ views, saying, ‘Bernie has a very trippy record. … Bernie has all of this loopy stuff in his background, saying things like women get cancer from having too many orgasms or toddlers should run around naked and touch each other’s genitals to insulate themselves from porn. Why has this stuff not been more surfaced?’ O’Brien asked. ‘He has written about women’s rape fantasies, that hasn’t been surfaced. That’s the loony side of Bernie.’ “  Mr. O’Brien is not exaggerating. These essays of Mr. Sanders, written when he was in his 30s, provide a window into his opinion of humanity. The Examiner called these “academic” writings. They were not. The leftist magazine Mother Jones first uncovered this rambling philosophical history of Mr. Sanders back in 2015, when they reported, “He dabbled in carpentry and tried to get by as a freelance journalist for alternative newspapers and regional publications, contributing interviews, political screeds, and, one time, a stream-of-consciousness essay on the nature of male-female sexual dynamics: ‘A man goes home and masturbates his typical fantasy. A woman on her knees, a woman tied up, a woman abused … A woman enjoys intercourse with her man — as she fantasizes being raped by 3 men simultaneously. … Do you know why the newspaper with the articles like ‘Girl 12 raped by 14 men’ sell so well? To what in us are they appealing?’ “  Back in May 2015 after the Mother Jones expose, the then-Sanders campaign responded by stating, “[T]he article was a ‘dumb attempt at dark satire in an alternative publication’ ” that “in no way reflects his views or record on women.”  In other essays for the same alternative rag, according to Mother Jones, is what Mr. O’Brien is referring to regarding Mr. Sanders‘ linking breast cancer and “other things” to not having enough “biosexual excitation.” He also extols the benefit of having children touch each other’s sex organs in order to make them immune to pornography.  When we think about what sort of attitude one has to have about other human beings to drive them to embrace and promote the disaster of socialism, writings like these provide part of an answer. Socialists and communists have so little regard for the individual, they’ve conjured up a system for which they believe the … deplorables should be grateful.  Only those who think so little of others embrace a system that destroys lives. With all we’ve seen in the last 100 years, Mr. Sanders knows the scourge he’s promoting, and he doesn’t seem to care.  • Tammy Bruce, president of Independent Women’s Voice, author and Fox News contributor, is a radio talk-show host.

Climate change may increase risk from invasive plant species as favorable climate conditions allow invaders to expand into new ranges. Here, we use bioclimatic envelope modeling to assess current climatic habitat, or lands climatically suitable for invasion, for three of the most dominant and aggressive invasive plants in the southeast United States: kudzu (Pueraria lobata), privet (Ligustrum sinense; L. vulgare), and cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica). We define climatic habitat using both the Maxent and Mahalanobis distance methodologies, and we define the best climatic predictors based on variables that best ‘constrain' species distributions and variables that ‘release' the most land area if excluded. We then use an ensemble of 12 atmosphere-ocean general circulation models to project changes in climatic habitat for the three invasive species by 2100. The combined methodologies, predictors, and models produce a robust assessment of invasion risk inclusive of many of the approaches typically used individually to assess climate change impacts. Current invasion risk is widespread in southeastern states for all three species, although cogongrass invasion risk is more restricted to the Gulf Coast. Climate change is likely to enable all three species to greatly expand their ranges. Risk from privet and kudzu expands north into Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and New England states by 2100. Risk from cogongrass expands as far north as Kentucky and Virginia. Heightened surveillance and prompt eradication of small pockets of invasion in northern states should be a management priority.

'It's gotten bad enough that even Donald Trump finally decided to wear a mask in public,' Biden scoffed.  Later he made fun of some of the statements Trump has made about clean energy sources.  'When Donald Trump thinks about renewable energy he sees windmills somehow causing cancer,' Biden said. 'When I think about these windmills, I see American manufacturing, American workers racing to dominate the global market.'  'When Donald Trump talks about improving efficiency by retro-fitting lighting systems with LED bulbs - remember what he said? He said he doesn't like LED because quote- \"the light's no good, I always look orange,' Biden added.  Trump then took to the Rose Garden podium in what Bloomberg had reported was to be a China-centric press conference.  It did start with China, but quickly veered into a diatribe about Biden, who Trump cast as cozy with the Chinese communist party.  'In contrast, Joe Biden's entire career has been a gift to the Chinese communist party and to the calamity of, of errors that they've made, they've made so many error,' the president said at the beginning of his assault.  Throughout his one hour and four minute appearance, Trump also brought up Biden's son Hunter, who had business dealings with the Chinese.  Trump then started picking through the Biden campaign's 110-page document of policy prescriptions, going after the Democrat on climate change, police reform and immigration.  The political attack gave the impression Biden was taking up significant space in Trump's head.  But Trump insisted that 2020 looked a lot like 2016 - pointing to the crowds he attracted, while also pushing that there was a secret Trump vote.  The president mentioned his June trip to Maine.  'We went up there recently there were crowds, thousands of people lined up going over to a factory where we were opening up for making swabs, a beautiful big new factory making swabs,' the president said.  Thousands did line the streets for Trump's motorcade. The vast majority were supporters, but a number of 'Black Lives Matter' protesters came out too.  'I think a lot of people don't want to talk about it. I think they're not going to say hey I'm for Trump, I'm for Trump, they don't want to go through the process,' Trump also said.  The president said his supporters didn't want to admit to supporting him because of unfair media treatment.  'The media doesn't treat us fairly, they never have and perhaps they never will,' the president complained. 'But maybe they will when we turn this around for a second time and it's going to happen very quickly,' he said, likely referencing the economy.  The president again shared concerns about mail-in voting, alleging there would be fraud.  He previously had tweeted that he worried that widespread mail-in voting would lead to Republican losses.  But then he also said that he believed Trump supporters made up a majority of Americans.  'I think you have a silent majority the likes of which this country has never seen before,' Trump said.

The commonwealth theme for 2020 is “delivering a common future” highlighting how the 54 member countries in the Commonwealth family are innovating, connecting and transforming, to help achieve some of its goals.  Mr Adamu said the ministry will also, begin the implementation of a five-year special project known as Adolescent Girls Initiative for Learning and Empowerment, specifically targeted at out of school girls between the ages of 10 and 20 at the secondary school level.  He said the project on girls’ education is supported by the World Bank and is aimed at reducing the out-of-school children scourge within the next two years.  Currently, Nigeria has over 10 million out of school children.  The Minister said the collective task of delivering to all Commonwealth member countries a cherished common future marked with togetherness, was with a functional way of doing things.  Speaking on the connection of Nigeria to the common future, Mr Adamu said Nigeria reveres her cultural, economic and educational exchanges as it has contributed immensely to the common future the countries desire.   Commonwealth scholarship  Meanwhile, he said more than 2000 Nigerians have benefited from Commonwealth scholarship since its inception, with an average of 12-18 beneficiary scholars every year.  “Besides these, the Federal Ministry of Education coordinates other bilateral schemes in which there are at least 450 beneficiary scholars.”  The Minister said the common threat to member states includes an existential threat to life by climate change and not limited to disruptive forces to the peace of members nations.  Mr Adamu, however, said Nigeria is committed to the peace of member nations and the entire world.  Also speaking, the Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, said various activities were organised by the Federal Ministry of Education, which he outlined as flag parade, theme song, dance drama and cultural display.  Mr Nwajiuba said they were planned to stir the interest of Nigerian youths towards connecting, innovating and transforming themselves towards achieving a developed nation in line with the Year 2020, theme.

The vote was proposed by LSE's Peta representative Phoebe Woodruff, who now wants all meat banned from the university.  The college, which is the fourth-ranked university in Britain, has almost 12,000 students, however, the proposal to ban meat was supported by 243 people. Some 170 voted against the proposal while 47 abstained - providing a 52.8 per cent majority for the ban.  Students at the London School of Economics have voted in favour of banning beef from the campus following a meeting. Some 243 members of the 12,000 student population of the college supported the proposal made by a member of Peta  The college insists that the vote is not binding.  LSE is the latest campus to see a vote on banning beef, following successful campaigns at Goldsmiths - part of the University of London - and Cambridge.  A small number of students at the University of East Anglia also voted in favour of a beef ban but this was subsequently overturned when the main student body became aware of the proposal.  Students in Edinburgh have also voted against a proposed beef ban.  Ms Woodruff, who proposed the motion at LSE said: 'Since beef is only the leading contributor to climate change and environmental degradation of all animal products rather than the sole culprit, the LSESU should also set an aim to phase out all animal products from its cafes, dining halls, and catering orders while increasing more environmentally friendly, plant-based options.  'The exact time frame of this reduction is at the discretion of student leaders, but the undeniable and looming threat of climate change should motivate more expedited action.'  Accrording to Peta: 'Just like humans, cows form close friendships, and they grieve when their friends or family members die. Yet in the beef industry, families are torn apart, calves are mutilated, and many cows are slaughtered when they’re just 18 months old.'  In a statement following the vote, Peta claimed: 'Raising and killing cows for their flesh is also destroying our planet. The production of beef is responsible for more greenhouse-gas emissions than that of any other food – a staggering 40 times more than the production of beans or peas. T  'The beef industry is a major contributor to the Amazon rainforest fires, deforestation, drought, and water and air pollution.'  Many UK universities are trying to reduce their carbon footprints, by reducing beef consumption and banning single use plastics.  Scores of institutions have committed to tackling their carbon footprint by reducing meat consumption, switching to reusable straws, crockery and cutlery, and turning lights and screens off.  Peta activist Phoebe Woodruff, who was behind the beef motion now wants all meat banned from the university  Other schemes included recycling used coffee grounds into sustainable biofuels, removing products containing palm oil, and planting native bulbs to attract birds and insects to university grounds.  Universities have pledged to go carbon neutral in a handful of cases, with details obtained under freedom of information laws showing the array of schemes being established at campuses across the country.  University leaders said the higher education sector 'recognises the importance' of these issues to staff and students and is committed to making progress, while student groups praised universities for taking action – partly due to pressure from undergraduates.  Environmental issues have been under greater spotlight among younger people following the protest actions of Swedish student Greta Thunberg, who has joined the likes of naturalist Sir David Attenborough, former US president Barack Obama and UK pop band The 1975 in calls for action.  A PA investigation, which drew responses from 144 UK universities and colleges, found that many have taken action on plastics.  While most have not opted to ban single-use plastic bottles, nearly one in three (42 institutions) are considering some sort of restriction.  Levies on these items – or subsidies for those who bring reusable cups – are becoming popular, with 58 per cent saying they have introduced such as measure.  A handful have introduced bans on meat products – particularly beef, the production of which concerns environmentalists due to animal methane output, water consumption and effluent waste.  Several universities have introduced measures to reduce beef consumption on campus  However, the University of East Anglia reversed a beef ban following student outrage  Vegetarian and vegan events are becoming commonplace, with around half of universities and colleges saying they are running such schemes or have done so previously.  Around a fifth (21 per cent) of universities have concrete plans to become carbon neutral or achieve net zero, while many more are looking at the issue or want to put plans in place.  A greater number of universities said they had increased the number of water fountains on campus in recent years than not – with 59 having introduced new hydration points compared with 51 who had not.  PA's investigation also found some more unusual environmental measures.  At least four universities – the School of African and Oriental Studies, Glasgow School of Art, Cranfield University and the Royal Academy of Music – are pursuing beekeeping or honey-harvesting schemes.  The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and Glasgow Caledonian University are among those promoting tree-planting.  A spokesman for Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors, said: 'Universities take climate change very seriously and recognise the importance of this issue to students and staff alike.  'Through their research, UK universities are leading the way in tackling global environmental challenges.  'As well as moving away from the use of fossil fuels, universities are working hard to tackle their own carbon footprints: investing in energy-saving technologies, finding sustainable supply chains and focusing on greater energy efficiency, including greener and more sustainable buildings.'  National Union of Students president Zamzam Ibrahim said: 'It is great to see our universities are at a tipping point and there is no doubt that this has been in part thanks to student pressure.  'NUS has campaigned for years to make our institutions just and sustainable from our divestment campaigns to our recycling campaigns.  'We saw the student movement make history again with the announcement that over half of UK universities have committed to divest from fossil fuel companies.'

What \"white privilege\" means in small-town West Virginia   December 29, 2019  By Lloyd Marcus Two years ago, my wife Mary and I relocated from Florida to West Virginia to be closer to our elderly parents. We have witnessed traditional American values displayed in our tiny town of 500 which I've affectionately nicknamed Trump Country USA. Our two shopping options are the country store/gas station or the Dollar General.I am one of probably ten blacks in town.On a trip to the Dollar General, I saw an elderly white gentleman in the parking lot slowly returning his shopping cart to the store. \"I can take that for you sir.\" I said. \"Thank you young man.\" he replied. Then he asked, \"Do I know you? You look like someone I know.\" I replied, \"No sir. We moved here 2 years ago.\"With a great warm smile, he said, \"My name is Pop Kern. I'm 89 years old. I've lived here all my life.\" As we chatted, Pop Kern said, \"At 9 years old, I milked 9 cows every morning before school and 9 cows after school. My pay was $5 a week.\"I thought, I guess Pop Kern did not get the memo about what Democrats call his racist and unfair \"white privilege.\" He just got up every morning and did what he had to do to earn a living. He lives in the home he grew up in which he owns and has acquired a second house. I could tell he is a kind man who worked hard his entire life.I've seen Pop Kern around town, walking in baby steps to pick up his mail at the post office. He is always pleasant, giving me a wave, a smile or a have a good day.It turns my stomach the way despicable evil Democrat presidential candidates say white men like Pop Kern are responsible for everything wrong in the world. Democrats boldly proclaim that if elected president, they will punish Pop Kern; tax the heck out of him and force him to pay reparations to minorities and even illegal aliens. https://fxn.ws/2EZovZ8 Pop Kern said, \"Where do you live?\" I described our location. \"I know where you live. That's the house with the beautiful front porch. I've driven by and admired it several times,\" he replied.I did not tell Pop Kern that we won $50 for second place in the town's annual Christmas home decorating contest. The home that won first place had a gazillion lights. No, I am not jealous.Our conversation in the Dollar General parking lot was the first time Pop Kern and I actually chatted. It ended with Pop Kern shaking my hand while saying, \"Nice talking with you Lloyd. You're a good man.\"The hate-filled war on straight white men has become so extreme that the University of Melbourne Student Union wants to ban white men from speaking in classes so women and transgenders will feel free to contribute to discussions. https://dailym.ai/2qpzjMD Insane social justice warriors demand that white men be silenced; not allowed to have an opinion regarding reviewing movies, climate change and everything in between.Folks, we have allowed leftists to create a generation of hate-filled social justice warrior terrorists who believe the world would be a much better place if we could get rid of scum-of-the-earth white guys like Pop Kern.While I am pleased that more and more people are fighting back, we need more people telling SJWs, \"No! Back off! Get a life and get a job!\"The Democrat Party is the greatest distributor of class envy, racial hate and division. They have disdain for all things patriotic, wholesome and good.

But in Sweden, a scientist alarmed by the increasing signs of global warming she witnessed on her latest Arctic research trip is hoping Trump is voted out, not simply because she believes Democrat Joe Biden will do better against climate change but also because she wants to fall back in love with a country she now finds repellent.  Two voices, from among the multitudes of people across the globe for whom the U.S. election is not a faraway event in a faraway land but an impossible-to-ignore contest with stakes for the entire world. For many, that’s especially true in a year in which the scythe of the coronavirus cutting through millions of lives and livelihoods has driven home the need for countries to work together.  Because Trump has had such an outsize impact on global affairs — tracing his own “America First” course and upending traditional alliances, friendships and norms — the possibility of change in the White House has left the rest of the world even more captivated than usual by an election in which it has no say.  “America votes and gives the world a president,” tweeted the editor in chief of the Ashraq Al-Awsat newspaper, which is Saudi-owned and published from London.  As ballots were cast, global onlookers both fascinated and trepidatious braced for the butterfly effect of America’s choice and its knock-on effects big and small. A very real feared repercussion for some was the prospect of a reelected Trump further closing pathways to immigrants and some visitors.  “Trump makes these unexpected decisions out of nowhere and the lives of millions are changed,” said Ishan Kalra, a doctoral student in linguistics from India who fears her studies in the United States could be cut short. “It’s on my mind all the time.”  By often refusing to be a team player on global initiatives, including pulling the U.S. out of international efforts to slow climate change and withdrawing from the World Health Organization in the midst of the virus pandemic, Trump dismayed many around the world who long for U.S. engagement and leadership.  That includes Gunhild Rosqvist, a Stockholm University professor just back from her latest trip studying climate warming’s impact on Arctic communities. She’ll be keeping a close eye on her smartphone as election results come in, hoping that Biden wins and reengages with pressing global problems.  “If America drops out even more from the global agreements, it’s going to be bad,” Rosqvist said. “If Trump wins, it means that half of the population in America thinks he’s doing a good job, and that’s scary because then that means they don’t care.”  In the suburbs of Paris, the founder of a Black literature book club said that if Trump is reelected, her first thought will be that it’s a signal French nationalist far-right leader Marine Le Pen also could win in France’s 2022 presidential election. Laurie Pezeron said Trump’s unabashed nationalism and flirting with far-right groups has emboldened extremists beyond U.S. shores who now “express themselves far more freely and aren’t ashamed of their supremacist views.”  The particularly rancorous nature of the battle for the presidency made it a ready target for critics’ jibes. In Africa, commentators noted the irony of the Trump administration voicing concerns about election irregularities in Tanzania as Trump himself makes unsupported claims about voting fraud in the U.S. campaign.  Iran’s supreme leader also couldn’t resist an Election Day dig.  “The incumbent president … says this is the most-rigged U.S. election throughout history,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a televised address Tuesday. ”His opponent says Trump intends to widely cheat. This is American democracy.”  But in the Normandy town of Sainte Marie du Mont, store owner Philippe Tanne was relishing the spectacle of America voting in the only election he cares about outside France.  Before the pandemic, the former soldier traveled to the United States two or three times a year because “I really love the country, the way of life. For us, it represents freedom.”  If Trump wins, he’ll proudly fly his “Trump 2020” flag at the front of his store that sells military memorabilia, facing the village square where U.S. forces fought off Nazi occupiers in 1944 and the church where bullet holes left by the squirt of a machine gun remain visible in the confessional’s wooden panels.  “I’d like to have a president in France who thinks a bit like him,” Tanne said. “He says, ‘Americans first, let’s make America work for us.’ I’d like to have a French president who says ‘the French first.’”  Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran; Sarah El Deeb in Beirut, Lebanon; Cara Anna in Nairobi, Kenya; Sheikh Saaliq in New Delhi, and AP journalists elsewhere in the world contributed.

The #greenminions applaud!#NobelPrize #GretaThunberg https://t.co/yUpSjGCffa — Thiago Maia (@ThiagoMaia2503) January 31, 2020   Greta Demands Action Now!  Greta gets accolades for demanding the world Immediately and Completely Divest From Fossil Fuels.  \"We demand at this year’s World Economic Forum, participants from all companies, banks, institutions and governments: immediately and completely divest from fossil fuels,\" said Greta.  Even if you are convinced man and not the sun is the overwhelming force in climate change, the idea that we can immediately divest from fossil fuels and have \"real zero\" emissions is economic nonsense.  Such statements do not merit praise, they merit ridicule. And her parents deserve scorn for putting her on stage to be used in this way.  The media treats Greta like she is some sort of saint. Actually, she is little but a pawn in someone else's game on a fool's mission to achieve the impossible.   Success Defined  Ironically, Greta's message is so absurd that if we did what she asked, there would be panic and a global economic collapse.  Among other things, food production would collapse. Of course, if 90% of the people died from starvation from her idiotic proposal, we would come close to her goal of \"success\".  Meanwhile, Greta travels the world to preach her silly message wearing shoes and clothes with a high carbon footprint. Worse yet is the carbon footprint of her travels.   Greta's Carbon Footprint  Greta sometimes travels by an alleged zero-emission sailboat.  However, please take a look at Greta Thunberg’s Not-So-Little Carbon Footprint.  She most recently traveled to the United States, and is now about to embark on a whirlwind tour as part of her global climate strike, and won’t return to Europe for nine months. She’ll now be heading to Canada, then Mexico, and then in December Greta will head to Chile for the UN climate conference. That’s a lot of traveling. So how does Greta get around to all her speaking engagements on behalf of the planet? You might be surprised to learn that Greta didn’t come to the US by air. No, Greta came by boat. And not just any boat—we’re talking about a zero-emissions sailboat called the Malizia II, which took her weeks. Malizia II has solar panels and underwater turbines that generate electricity onboard. Experts say that the Malizia II offers the lowest-carbon way to cross the Atlantic. Fantastic! That’s the picture that Greta supporters would like you to focus on. But there’s another side to this eco-friendly journey: Two crewmembers had to fly across the Atlantic to New York to bring the boat back, and two of the crewmembers that made the original voyage had to fly across the Atlantic from the US to return home. That’s four flights to keep Greta from making two. We won’t even mention the train trip Greta took to get to Plymouth, England, in order to set sail, nor will we mention the numerous freeze-dried meals, which we assume are encased in some single-use plastic product, which by our estimations, the two-man crew, Greta, her father, and some cameraman documenting the experience equated to over 200 meals. We also won’t talk about how Greta will return home, since the boat has since returned to Europe. In a nutshell, the 5,337-kilometer flight times four people generated 2,134,800 grams of C02 by our calculations, just for the flights alone.  Trump Threatens Retaliation On Proposed Carbon Taxes  The above article is from October 2019, but I just came across it while researching Trump Threatens Retaliation on Proposed EU Carbon Taxes.  Comments From Acting Man on Carbon Taxes  The EU and Germany in particular is committing economic suicide to battle a non-problem. This is too absurd for words; of course, politicians in Europe never let an opportunity to raise taxes pass them by - and they try to make others pay as well now, because they know Europe is losing on every front in terms of tax and regulatory competition. I'm opposed to Trump's trade war, but in this case his threat of retaliation actually deserves to be supported, if only because it may lead to the EU thinking twice about imposing yet another layer of taxes for absolutely nothing. In Germany electricity prices have gone through the roof, and for what? We hear that global temperatures continue to rise (based on highly dubious, very likely outright fraudulent data) and CO2 in the atmosphere also continues to rise inexorably year after year. What exactly are Germany's citizens making this sacrifice for? 100ds of thousands are living in \"energy poverty\" by now and can no longer afford to heat their homes properly in the winter. Germany used to export electricity to the rest of Europe - today it is now dependent on imports to prevent its grid from collapsing when there is not enough wind or sunlight. And all of this happened under the \"conservatives\" of Merkel!!  The above accurate comments from Pater Tenebrarum at the Acting Man Blog.   Fashionista Report  Also consider the Fashionista report IS YOUR GRETA THUNBERG T-SHIRT CONTRIBUTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE?  The problem with T-shirts, even those purporting to promote climate action, is they're especially hard on the environment. Just growing the cotton that goes into one can take 2,700 liters of water — enough for a person to drink for two-and-a-half years — and, if it isn't farmed organically, a third of a pound of pesticides and other agricultural chemicals. T-shirts, particularly those with \"heathered\" yarns of mixed colors, may contain polyester and other synthetic fibers, which are derived from crude oil and emit greenhouse-gas emissions from extraction to disposal. They're also linked to the production of microplastics: minuscule fragments of plastic, tinier than one-fifth of an inch, that slough off during laundering to pollute the oceans, tap water, table salt and the guts of every species of sea turtle.  Greta might not be able to control T-Shirts with her name on them, so cut her some slack for that, but not the fools buying them in her name.  The important point is Greta cruises and jet sets accompanied with a film crew in the name of zero emissions while having a carbon footprint greater than nearly everyone else on the planet.  She demands we do as she says, not what she does, knowing full well if we actually did what she asked, there would be a global economic collapse.  All hail Greta, the great carbon hypocrite.

Good Evening, America. It's an honor to speak to you tonight from the hell out of the hallowed grounds of Fort McHenry, the site of the very battle that inspired the words of our national anthem. Those words have inspired this land of heroes in every generation sense. It was on this site 206 years ago when our Young Republic heroically withstood a ferocious naval bombardment from the most powerful empire on Earth. They came to crush our revolution, to divide our nation and to end the American experiment. The heroes who held this fort took their stand for life, Liberty, freedom in the American flag and those ideals have defined our nation. But they were hardly ever mentioned at last week's Democratic National Convention. Instead, Democrats spent four days attacking America. Joe Biden said that we were living through a season of darkness. But as President, Trump said, where Joe Biden sees American darkness, we see American greatness in these challenging times. Our country needs a president who believes in America, who believes in the boundless capacity of the American people to meet any challenge, defeat any foe and defend the freedoms we hold. Dear America needs four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. Before I go further, allow me to say a word to the families and communities in the path of Hurricane Laura. My prayers are with you tonight, and our administration is working closely with authorities in the states that will be impacted. FEMA has mobilized, resource is and supplies for those in harm's way. This is a serious storm, and we urge all those in the affected areas to heed state and local authorities. Stay safe and know that will be with you every step of the way to support, rescue, respond and recover in the days and weeks ahead. That's what Americans do. Four years ago, I answered the call to join this ticket because I knew that Donald Trump and the leadership and the vision to make America great again. And for the last four years I've watched this president endure unrelenting attacks but get up every day and fight to keep the promises that he made to the American people. So with gratitude for the confidence President Donald Trump is placed in me the support of our Republican Party and the grace of God. I humbly accept your nomination to run and serve as vice president of the United States. Serving the American people in this office has been a journey I never expected. It's a journey that would not have been possible without the support of my family, beginning with my wonderful wife care. She's a lifelong school teacher, an incredible mother to our three Children, and she is one outstanding second lady of the United States. I'm so proud of me. And we couldn't be more proud of our three Children. Marine Corps Captain Michael J. Pence and his wife, Sarah. Our daughter, Charlotte Pence Bond, an author and the wife to Lieutenant Henry Bond, who is currently deployed and serving our nation in the United States Navy and our youngest, a recent law school bread. Our daughter Audrey, and her fiance, who, like so many other Americans, had to delay their wedding this summer. But we can't wait for Dan to be a part of our family. In addition, my wife and kids, the person who shaped my life the most, is also with us tonight. My mom, Nancy. Oh, she is the daughter of an Irish immigrant 87 years young and mom follows politics very closely. The truth be told, sometimes I think I'm actually her second favorite candidate on the Trump Pence ticket. Thank you, Mom. I love you. Over the past four years, I've had the privilege to work closely with our president. I've seen him when the cameras are off. Americans see President Trump in lots of different ways, But there's no doubt how President Trump sees America. He sees America for what it is. A nation that has dunmore good in this world than any other, a nation that deserves far more gratitude than grievance. And if you want a president who falls silent when our heritage is demeaned or insulted, he's not your man. Now. We came by very different routes to this partnership, and some people think we're a little bit different. You know, I have learned a few things watching, watching him deal with all that we've been through over the past four years. He does things in his own way on his own terms. Not much gets past, and when he has an opinion he's liable to share it. He certainly kept things interesting, but more importantly, President Donald Trump has kept his word to the American people. In a city known for talkers, President Trump is a do ER, and few presidents have brought more independence, energy or determination to that office. Four years ago, we inherited a military hollowed out by devastating budget cuts, an economy struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression. Isis controlled a landmass twice the size of Pennsylvania, and we witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values freedom of religion and the right to life. That's when President Donald Trump stepped in, and from Day one he kept his word. We rebuilt our military. This president signed the largest increase in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan and created the first new branch of our armed forces in 70 years, the United States Space Force. And with that renewed energy, we also returned American astronauts to space on an American rocket for the first time in nearly 10 years and after years of scandal that robbed our veterans of the care that you earned in the uniform of the United States President Trump kept his word again. We reform the V A and Veterans Choice is now available for every veteran in America. Our armed forces and our veterans fill this land of heroes, and many join us tonight in this historic for tonight we have among us four recipients of the Medal of Honor. Six recipients of the Purple Heart, a gold star, mother of a gallon neighbors and wounded warriors from Soldier Strong, a group that serves our injured veterans everything. We are honored by your presence, and we thank you for your service with heroes just like these. We defend this nation every day, but under this commander in chief, we've taken the fight to radical Islamic terrorists on our terms on their soil. Last year, American armed forces took the last inch of Isis territory, crushed their caliphate and took down their leader without one American casualties. And I was there when President Trump gave the order to take out the world's most dangerous terrorist. Iran's top general will never harm another American because Qassam Salamoni is gone. Theme. My fellow Americans, you deserve to know. Joe Biden criticized President Trump following those decisions decisions to rid the world of to terrorist leaders. But it's not surprising because history records the Joe Biden even opposed the operation that took down Osama bin Laden. It's no wonder that the secretary of defense under the Obama Biden administration once said that Joe Biden has been, and I quote wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades. So we've stood up to our enemies, and we've stood with our allies. Like when President Trump kept his word and move the American Embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the state of Israel, setting the stage for the first Arab country to recognise Israel in 26 years. Closer to home, we appointed more than 200 conservative judges to our federal courts. We supported the right to life and all the God given liberties in trying in our Constitution, including the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. And when it came to the economy, President Trump kept his word and then some. We passed the largest tax cut in reform in American history. We rolled back more federal red tape than any administration ever had. We unleashed American energy and fought for free and fair trade. And in our first three years, businesses large and small created more than seven million good paying jobs, including 500,000 manufacturing jobs. All across America. Our country became a net exporter of energy. For the first time in 70 years, unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanic Americans hit the lowest level ever recorded. And on this 1/100 anniversary of a woman's right to vote, I'm proud to report that under President Donald Trump, we achieved the lowest unemployment rate for women in 65 years and more Americans working than ever before. In our first three years, we built the greatest economy in the world. We made America great again, and then the Corona virus struck from China. Before the first case of the Corona virus spread within the United States, the president took unprecedented action and suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now that action saved untold American lives, and I can tell you firsthand it bought us invaluable time tow launch the greatest national mobilization since World War two. President Trump marshaled the full re sources of our federal government from the outset, he directed us to forge a seamless partnership with governors across America. In both political parties, we partnered with private industry to reinvent, testing and produce supplies that that were distributed to hospitals around the land. Today we're conducting more than 800,000 tests a day, and we have coordinated the delivery of billions of pieces of personal protective equipment for our amazing doctors, nurses and health care workers. We saw to the manufacturer of 100,000 ventilators in 100 days, and no one who required a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator. In the United States, we build hospitals, surge military medical personnel and enacted in economic rescue package that save 50 million American jobs. As we speak, we're developing a growing number of treatments known as therapeutics, including convalescent plasma that are saving lives all across America now. Last week, Joe Biden said that no miracle is coming Well, what Joe doesn't seem to understand is that America is a nation of miracles, and I'm proud to report that we're on track to have the world's first safe, effective Corona virus vaccine by the end of this year. After all the sacrifice in this year like no. One, all the hardship we're finding our way forward again. But tonight our hearts are with all the families, have lost loved ones and have family members still struggling with serious illness. In this country, we mourn with those who mourn. We grieve with those who green. In this night, I know that millions of Americans will pause and pray for God's comfort for each of you. Our country doesn't get through such a time unless it's people find strength within the response of doctors, nurses, first responders, farmers, factory workers, truckers and everyday Americans who put the health and safety of their neighbors first has been nothing short of heroic, Veronica say is put on her scrubs every day, day in and day out went to work in one of New York City's busiest hospital. She stayed on the job, put in the long hours until it was done and then got back in her neighborhood and help neighbors and friends struggling. Her brother William is a New York City firefighters, and they're both emblematic of heroes all across this country. They're with us tonight, and I say to them and all of you you have earned the admiration of the American people, and we will always be grateful for your service and care. Thanks to the courage and compassion of the American people, we're slowing the spread, We're protecting the vulnerable and we're saving lives. And we're opening up America again because of the strong foundation that President Trump poured in our first three years. We've already gained back 9.3 million jobs in the last three months alone. And we're not just opening up America again. We're opening up America's schools, and I'm proud to report that my wife, Karen, that school teacher I've been married to, will be returning to her classroom next week. And so, to all of our heroic teachers and faculty and staff, thank you for being there for our kids. We're going to stay with you every step of the way in the days ahead. As we open up America again, I promise you, we'll continue to put the health of America first. And as we work to bring this economy back, we all have a role to play, and we all have a choice to make. On November 3rd, you need to ask yourself who do you trust to rebuild this economy? A career politician who presided over the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression or a proven leader who created the greatest economy in the world? The choice is clear. To bring America all the way back. We need four more years of President Donald Trump in the way my fellow Americans were passing through a time of testing. But in the midst of this global pandemic, just a czar nation had begun to recover. We've seen violence and chaos in the streets of our major cities. President Trump and I will always support the right of Americans to peaceful protest. But rioting and looting is not peaceful protest. Tearing down statues is not free speech, and those who do so will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Last week, Joe Biden didn't say one word about the violence and chaos engulfing cities across this country. So let me be clear. The violence must stop, whether in Minneapolis, Portland or Kenosha, too many heroes have died defending our freedom to see Americans strike each other down. We will have law and order on the streets of this country for every American of every race and creed and color. President Trump and I know that the men and women that put on the uniform of law enforcement are the best of us. Every day when they walk out that door, they consider our lives more important than their own people. Like Dave Patrick Underwear, an officer in the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service who was shot and killed during the riots in Oakland, California Dave's heroism is emblematic of the heroes that serve in blue every day. We're privileged tonight to be joined by his sister, Angela Angela. We say to you, we we grieve with your family in America will never forget or failed toe honor officer Dave Patrick. Under what the American people know, We don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement and standing with our African American neighbors to improve the quality of their lives, education, jobs and safety. And from the first days of this administration, we've done both, and we will keep supporting law enforcement and keep supporting are African American and minority communities across this land for four more years. Joe Biden says that America is systemically racist and that law enforcement in America as and I quote an implicit bias against minorities. When asked whether he'd support cutting funding law enforcement, Joe Biden replied, Yes, absolutely. Joe Biden would double down on the very policies that are leading the violence in America cities. The hard truth is, you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America under President Trump. We will always stand with those who stand on the thin blue line, and we're not going to defund the police. Not now, not ever. My fellow Americans were passing through a time of testing, but soon we will come to a time for choosing. Joe Biden has referred to himself as a transition candidate, and many were asking transition to what? But last week, Democrats didn't talk very much about their agenda, and if I were them, I wouldn't either. I mean, Bernie Sanders did tell his followers that Joe Biden would be the most liberal president in modern times. In fact, he said, and I quote that many of the ideas he fought for that just a few years ago were considered radical are now mainstream in the Democratic Party. At the root of their agenda is the belief that America is driven by envy, not aspiration, that millions of Americans harbor ill will toward our neighbors instead of loving our neighbors as ourselves. The radical Left believes that the federal government must be involved in every aspect of our lives to correct those American wrongs. They believe the federal government needs to dictate how Americans live, how we should work, how we should raise our Children and, in the process, deprive our people of freedom, prosperity and security. Their agenda is based on government control. Our agenda is based on freedom. Where President Trump cut taxes. Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by nearly $4 trillion. Where this president achieved energy independence for the United States. Joe Biden would abolish fossil fuels and fracking and impose the regime of climate change regulations that would drastically increase the cost of living for working families where we fought for free and fair trade. And this president stood up to China and ended the era of economic surrender. Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for communist China. He wants to repeal all the tariffs that air leveling the playing field for American workers, and he actually criticized President Trump for suspending all travel to China at the outset of this pandemic. Joe Biden is for open borders, sanctuary cities, free lawyers and health care for illegal immigrants. President Trump. He secured our border and built nearly 300 miles of that border wall. Joe Biden wants to end school choice President Trump believes that every parent should have the right to choose where their Children go to school, regardless of their income or area code. President Trump President Trump has stood without apology for the sanctity of human life every day of this administration. Joe Biden. He supports taxpayer funding of abortion right up to the moment of birth. When you consider their agenda, it's clear Joe Biden would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for the radical left. The choice in this election has never been clearer, and the stakes have never been higher. Last week, Joe Biden said, democracies on the ballot and the truth is our economic recoveries on the ballot. Law and order are on the ballot, but so are things far more fundamental and foundational to our country in this election. It's not so much whether America will be more conservative or more liberal, more Republican or more Democrats. The choice in this election is whether America remains America. It's whether we will leave to our Children and our grandchildren, a country grounded in our highest ideals of freedom, free markets in the unalienable right to life and liberty, or whether we will leave them a country that's fundamentally transformed into something else. We stand at a crossroads. America. President Trump has set our nation on a path of freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden would set America on a path of socialism and decline, but we're not gonna let it happen. President Donald Trump believes in America and in the goodness of the American people, the boundless potential of every American to live out their dreams in freedom every day. President Trump has been fighting to protect the promise of America. Every day our president has been fighting to expand the reach of the American dream. Every day President Donald Trump has been fighting for you, and now it's our turn to fight for him on this night in the company of Heroes. I'm deeply grateful, deeply grateful for the privilege of serving as vice president of this great nation and to have the opportunity to serve again. I pray to be worthy of, and I will give that duty. All that's in in the year 2020. The American people have had more than our share of challenges, but thankfully, we have a president with the toughness, energy and resolved to see us through. Now those traits actually run in our national character. As the invading force learned on approach to this fort in September of 18 14 against fierce and sustained bombardment, our young country was defended by heroes not so different from those who are with us tonight. The enemy was counting on them to quit, but they never did. Fort McHenry held and one morning came our flag was still here. My fellow Americans, we're going through a time of testing. But if you look through the fog of these challenging times, you will see our flag is still there. Today, that Star Spangled Banner still waves over the land of the free and the home of the Brave. From these hallowed grounds, American patriots and generations going by did their part to defend freedom. Now it's our turn. So let's run the race marked out for us. Let's fix our eyes on Oh, glory and all she represents. Let's fix our eyes on this land of heroes and let their courage inspire. And let's fix our eyes on the author and perfecter of our faith and our freedom and never forget where the spirit of the Lord is. There is freedom. That means freedom always wins. My fellow Americans. Thank you for the honor of addressing you tonight and the opportunity to run and serve again as your vice president. I leave here today, inspire, and I leave here today more convinced than ever that we will do in our time as Americans have done throughout our long and storied past. We will defend our freedom and our way of life. We will re elect our president and principled Republican leaders across the land and with President Donald Trump in the White House for four more years. And with God's help, we will make America great again. Again. Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States. Yeah, please welcome the vice president of the United States, Mike Pence, accompanied by the secondly Mrs Karen Pence. Good Evening, America.

We defend this nation every day, but under this commander in chief, we've taken the fight to radical Islamic terrorists on our terms on their soil. Last year, American armed forces took the last inch of Isis territory, crushed their caliphate and took down their leader without one American casualties. And I was there when President Trump gave the order to take out the world's most dangerous terrorist. Iran's top general will never harm another American because Qassam Salamoni is gone. Theme. My fellow Americans, you deserve to know. Joe Biden criticized President Trump following those decisions decisions to rid the world of to terrorist leaders. But it's not surprising because history records the Joe Biden even opposed the operation that took down Osama bin Laden. It's no wonder that the secretary of defense under the Obama Biden administration once said that Joe Biden has been, and I quote wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades. So we've stood up to our enemies, and we've stood with our allies. Like when President Trump kept his word and move the American Embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the state of Israel, setting the stage for the first Arab country to recognise Israel in 26 years. Closer to home, we appointed more than 200 conservative judges to our federal courts. We supported the right to life and all the God given liberties in trying in our Constitution, including the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. And when it came to the economy, President Trump kept his word and then some. We passed the largest tax cut in reform in American history. We rolled back more federal red tape than any administration ever had. We unleashed American energy and fought for free and fair trade. And in our first three years, businesses large and small created more than seven million good paying jobs, including 500,000 manufacturing jobs. All across America. Our country became a net exporter of energy. For the first time in 70 years, unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanic Americans hit the lowest level ever recorded. And on this 1/100 anniversary of a woman's right to vote, I'm proud to report that under President Donald Trump, we achieved the lowest unemployment rate for women in 65 years and more Americans working than ever before. In our first three years, we built the greatest economy in the world. We made America great again, and then the Corona virus struck from China. Before the first case of the Corona virus spread within the United States, the president took unprecedented action and suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now that action saved untold American lives, and I can tell you firsthand it bought us invaluable time tow launch the greatest national mobilization since World War two. President Trump marshaled the full re sources of our federal government from the outset, he directed us to forge a seamless partnership with governors across America. In both political parties, we partnered with private industry to reinvent, testing and produce supplies that that were distributed to hospitals around the land. Today we're conducting more than 800,000 tests a day, and we have coordinated the delivery of billions of pieces of personal protective equipment for our amazing doctors, nurses and health care workers. We saw to the manufacturer of 100,000 ventilators in 100 days, and no one who required a ventilator was ever denied a ventilator. In the United States, we build hospitals, surge military medical personnel and enacted in economic rescue package that save 50 million American jobs. As we speak, we're developing a growing number of treatments known as therapeutics, including convalescent plasma that are saving lives all across America now. Last week, Joe Biden said that no miracle is coming Well, what Joe doesn't seem to understand is that America is a nation of miracles, and I'm proud to report that we're on track to have the world's first safe, effective Corona virus vaccine by the end of this year. After all the sacrifice in this year like no. One, all the hardship we're finding our way forward again. But tonight our hearts are with all the families, have lost loved ones and have family members still struggling with serious illness. In this country, we mourn with those who mourn. We grieve with those who green. In this night, I know that millions of Americans will pause and pray for God's comfort for each of you. Our country doesn't get through such a time unless it's people find strength within the response of doctors, nurses, first responders, farmers, factory workers, truckers and everyday Americans who put the health and safety of their neighbors first has been nothing short of heroic, Veronica say is put on her scrubs every day, day in and day out went to work in one of New York City's busiest hospital. She stayed on the job, put in the long hours until it was done and then got back in her neighborhood and help neighbors and friends struggling. Her brother William is a New York City firefighters, and they're both emblematic of heroes all across this country. They're with us tonight, and I say to them and all of you you have earned the admiration of the American people, and we will always be grateful for your service and care. Thanks to the courage and compassion of the American people, we're slowing the spread, We're protecting the vulnerable and we're saving lives. And we're opening up America again because of the strong foundation that President Trump poured in our first three years. We've already gained back 9.3 million jobs in the last three months alone. And we're not just opening up America again. We're opening up America's schools, and I'm proud to report that my wife, Karen, that school teacher I've been married to, will be returning to her classroom next week. And so, to all of our heroic teachers and faculty and staff, thank you for being there for our kids. We're going to stay with you every step of the way in the days ahead. As we open up America again, I promise you, we'll continue to put the health of America first. And as we work to bring this economy back, we all have a role to play, and we all have a choice to make. On November 3rd, you need to ask yourself who do you trust to rebuild this economy? A career politician who presided over the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression or a proven leader who created the greatest economy in the world? The choice is clear. To bring America all the way back. We need four more years of President Donald Trump in the way my fellow Americans were passing through a time of testing. But in the midst of this global pandemic, just a czar nation had begun to recover. We've seen violence and chaos in the streets of our major cities. President Trump and I will always support the right of Americans to peaceful protest. But rioting and looting is not peaceful protest. Tearing down statues is not free speech, and those who do so will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Last week, Joe Biden didn't say one word about the violence and chaos engulfing cities across this country. So let me be clear. The violence must stop, whether in Minneapolis, Portland or Kenosha, too many heroes have died defending our freedom to see Americans strike each other down. We will have law and order on the streets of this country for every American of every race and creed and color. President Trump and I know that the men and women that put on the uniform of law enforcement are the best of us. Every day when they walk out that door, they consider our lives more important than their own people. Like Dave Patrick Underwear, an officer in the Department of Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service who was shot and killed during the riots in Oakland, California Dave's heroism is emblematic of the heroes that serve in blue every day. We're privileged tonight to be joined by his sister, Angela Angela. We say to you, we we grieve with your family in America will never forget or failed toe honor officer Dave Patrick. Under what the American people know, We don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement and standing with our African American neighbors to improve the quality of their lives, education, jobs and safety. And from the first days of this administration, we've done both, and we will keep supporting law enforcement and keep supporting are African American and minority communities across this land for four more years. Joe Biden says that America is systemically racist and that law enforcement in America as and I quote an implicit bias against minorities. When asked whether he'd support cutting funding law enforcement, Joe Biden replied, Yes, absolutely. Joe Biden would double down on the very policies that are leading the violence in America cities. The hard truth is, you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America under President Trump. We will always stand with those who stand on the thin blue line, and we're not going to defund the police. Not now, not ever. My fellow Americans were passing through a time of testing, but soon we will come to a time for choosing. Joe Biden has referred to himself as a transition candidate, and many were asking transition to what? But last week, Democrats didn't talk very much about their agenda, and if I were them, I wouldn't either. I mean, Bernie Sanders did tell his followers that Joe Biden would be the most liberal president in modern times. In fact, he said, and I quote that many of the ideas he fought for that just a few years ago were considered radical are now mainstream in the Democratic Party. At the root of their agenda is the belief that America is driven by envy, not aspiration, that millions of Americans harbor ill will toward our neighbors instead of loving our neighbors as ourselves. The radical Left believes that the federal government must be involved in every aspect of our lives to correct those American wrongs. They believe the federal government needs to dictate how Americans live, how we should work, how we should raise our Children and, in the process, deprive our people of freedom, prosperity and security. Their agenda is based on government control. Our agenda is based on freedom. Where President Trump cut taxes. Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by nearly $4 trillion. Where this president achieved energy independence for the United States. Joe Biden would abolish fossil fuels and fracking and impose the regime of climate change regulations that would drastically increase the cost of living for working families where we fought for free and fair trade. And this president stood up to China and ended the era of economic surrender. Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for communist China. He wants to repeal all the tariffs that air leveling the playing field for American workers, and he actually criticized President Trump for suspending all travel to China at the outset of this pandemic. Joe Biden is for open borders, sanctuary cities, free lawyers and health care for illegal immigrants. President Trump. He secured our border and built nearly 300 miles of that border wall. Joe Biden wants to end school choice President Trump believes that every parent should have the right to choose where their Children go to school, regardless of their income or area code. President Trump President Trump has stood without apology for the sanctity of human life every day of this administration. Joe Biden. He supports taxpayer funding of abortion right up to the moment of birth. When you consider their agenda, it's clear Joe Biden would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for the radical left. The choice in this election has never been clearer, and the stakes have never been higher. Last week, Joe Biden said, democracies on the ballot and the truth is our economic recoveries on the ballot. Law and order are on the ballot, but so are things far more fundamental and foundational to our country in this election. It's not so much whether America will be more conservative or more liberal, more Republican or more Democrats. The choice in this election is whether America remains America. It's whether we will leave to our Children and our grandchildren, a country grounded in our highest ideals of freedom, free markets in the unalienable right to life and liberty, or whether we will leave them a country that's fundamentally transformed into something else. We stand at a crossroads. America. President Trump has set our nation on a path of freedom and opportunity. Joe Biden would set America on a path of socialism and decline, but we're not gonna let it happen. President Donald Trump believes in America and in the goodness of the American people, the boundless potential of every American to live out their dreams in freedom every day. President Trump has been fighting to protect the promise of America. Every day our president has been fighting to expand the reach of the American dream. Every day President Donald Trump has been fighting for you, and now it's our turn to fight for him on this night in the company of Heroes. I'm deeply grateful, deeply grateful for the privilege of serving as vice president of this great nation and to have the opportunity to serve again. I pray to be worthy of, and I will give that duty. All that's in in the year 2020. The American people have had more than our share of challenges, but thankfully, we have a president with the toughness, energy and resolved to see us through. Now those traits actually run in our national character. As the invading force learned on approach to this fort in September of 18 14 against fierce and sustained bombardment, our young country was defended by heroes not so different from those who are with us tonight. The enemy was counting on them to quit, but they never did. Fort McHenry held and one morning came our flag was still here. My fellow Americans, we're going through a time of testing. But if you look through the fog of these challenging times, you will see our flag is still there. Today, that Star Spangled Banner still waves over the land of the free and the home of the Brave. From these hallowed grounds, American patriots and generations going by did their part to defend freedom. Now it's our turn. So let's run the race marked out for us. Let's fix our eyes on Oh, glory and all she represents. Let's fix our eyes on this land of heroes and let their courage inspire. And let's fix our eyes on the author and perfecter of our faith and our freedom and never forget where the spirit of the Lord is. There is freedom. That means freedom always wins. My fellow Americans. Thank you for the honor of addressing you tonight and the opportunity to run and serve again as your vice president. I leave here today, inspire, and I leave here today more convinced than ever that we will do in our time as Americans have done throughout our long and storied past. We will defend our freedom and our way of life. We will re elect our president and principled Republican leaders across the land and with President Donald Trump in the White House for four more years. And with God's help, we will make America great again. Again. Thank you. God bless you. God bless the United States.

This was the same year the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was established and the federal Clean Air Act was promulgated.  Over the past five decades, since I rode my bike to school celebrating that inaugural day, the nation’s air quality has improved markedly. Particle and gaseous pollutants have been reduced tremendously, and ever-tightening health-based air-quality standards have been attained and maintained throughout the vast majority of the United States.  Since 1970, the climate has also changed along with its perception. Early on, with a declining world-wide average temperature, it was fear from a looming return to Ice Age conditions and mass starvation of an ever-increasing global populace that provoked calls for climate and population controls. Later, starting in the early 1980s, fears veered toward global warming, yet still too many people.  Today, the focused fear, besides that of the coronavirus global pandemic, remains on a climate crisis of excessive heat and inhabitants. But, is climate change, whether naturally or anthropogenically induced, necessarily a bad thing?  Without a doubt, the climate has changed, is changing and will continue to change. So, what else is new? The primary concern should be whether the climate is changing for better or worse. The secondary concern should be whether human activity has a long term, substantially negative impact on the change. And, if human activity definitely has such an impact, a tertiary concern should be whether human activity can be mitigated or eliminated from the climate equation.  The advancement of technology since the early 1970s brought about a wider distribution of available energy from abundant fossil fuel resources and with such progress much abject poverty has been alleviated. Yet, more than a billion people remain without access to reliable electricity that could bring comfort to their lives, eliminating the necessity of sullying wood and dung as their indoor cooking fuels.  With such discomforts of home largely in “pastoral” settings, so many people flock to life in the big city. Why? After all, the big city is where the climate is demonstrably warmer and so often less comfortable than the surrounding countryside.  Perhaps because, on balance, reliable electricity and a steady diet are so appealing. And perhaps that is why so many people from impoverished and unstable countries risk their lives to come to the most reliable country on Earth — the country that can be counted on for a consistent supply of abundant energy and food.  Those reliable conditions must be maintained during the current crisis. As Tucker Carlson of Fox television recently observed: “Our response to coronavirus could turn this into a far poorer nation. Poor countries are unhealthy countries, always and everywhere. In poor countries, people die of treatable diseases. In poor countries, people are far more vulnerable to obscure viruses, like the one we are fighting now. You want to keep Americans from dying before their time? Then don’t impoverish them.”  The coronavirus response must be measured and balanced. The focus must remain on the total person — addressing not only their health needs but their economic needs as well. After all, from a purely environmentalist perspective, people should be considered the most precious of all natural resources, worth maintaining and sustaining.  Keep the focus on people. Compassionate concern for humans and their habitat will go a long way to assuring a climate of comfort that celebrates both people and the planet for at least the next 50 years.  • Anthony J.

Smoke at concentrations that topped the government’s charts for health risks and lasted at least a day enshrouded counties inhabited by more than 8 million people across five states in recent weeks, AP’s analysis shows.  Major cities in Oregon, which has been especially hard hit, last month suffered the highest pollution levels they’ve ever recorded when powerful winds supercharged fires that had been burning in remote areas and sent them hurtling to the edge of densely populated Portland.  Medical complications began arising while communities were still enveloped in smoke, including hundreds of additional emergency room visits daily in Oregon, according to state health officials.  “It’s been brutal for me,” said Barb Trout, a 64-year-old retiree living south of Portland in the Willamette Valley. She was twice taken to the emergency room by ambulance following severe asthmatic reactions, something that had never happened to her before.  Trout had sheltered inside as soon as smoke rolled into the valley just after Labor Day but within days had an asthma attack that left her gasping for air and landed her in the ER. Two weeks later, when smoke from fires in California drifted into the valley, she had an even more violent reaction that Trout described as a near-death experience.  “It hit me quick and hard __ more so than the first one. I wasn’t hardly even breathing,” she recalled. After getting stabilized with drugs, Trout was sent home but the specter of a third attack now haunts her. She and her husband installed an alarm system so she can press a panic button when in distress to call for help.  “It’s put a whole new level on my life,” she said. “I’m trying not to live in fear, but I’ve got to be really really cautious.”  In nearby Salem, Trout’s pulmonologist Martin Johnson said people with existing respiratory issues started showing up at his hospital or calling his office almost immediately after the smoke arrived, many struggling to breathe. Salem is in Marion county, which experienced eight days of pollution at hazardous levels during a short period, some of the worst conditions seen the West over the past two decades, according to AP’s analysis.  Most of Johnson’s patients are expected to recover but he said some could have permanent loss of lung function. Then there are the “hidden” victims who Johnson suspects died from heart attacks or other problems triggered by the poor air quality but whose cause of death will be chalked up to something else.  “Many won’t show up at the hospital or they’ll die at home or they’ll show up at hospice for other reasons, such as pneumonia or other complications,” Johnson said.  Based on prior studies of pollution-related deaths and the number of people exposed to recent fires, researchers at Stanford University estimated that as many as 3,000 people over 65 in California alone died prematurely after being exposed to smoke during a six-week period beginning Aug. 1. Hundreds more deaths could have occurred in Washington over several weeks of poor air caused by the fires, according to University of Washington researchers.  The findings for both states have not been published in peer-reviewed journals. No such estimate was available for Oregon.  Wildfires are a regular occurrence in Western states but they’ve grown more intense and dangerous as a changing climate dries out forests thick with trees and underbrush from decades of fire suppression. What makes the smoke from these fires dangerous are particles too small for the naked eye to see that can be breathed in and cause respiratory problems.  On any given day, western fires can produce 10 times more particles than are produced by all other pollution sources including vehicle emissions and industrial facilities, said Shawn Urbanski, a U.S. Forest Service smoke scientist.  Fires across the West emitted more than a million tons of the particles in 2012, 2015 and 2017, and almost as much in 2018 — the year a blaze in Paradise, California killed 85 people and burned 14,000 houses, generating a thick plume that blanketed portions of Northern California for weeks. Figures for 2017 and 2018 are preliminary.  A confluence of meteorological events made the smoke especially bad this year: first, fierce winds up and down the coast whipped fires into a fury, followed in Oregon by a weather inversion that trapped smoke close to the ground and made it inescapable for days. Hundreds of miles to the south in San Francisco, smoke turned day into night, casting an eerie orange pall over a city where even before the pandemic facemasks had become common at times to protect against smoke.  AP’s analysis of smoke exposure was based on U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data compiled from hundreds of air quality monitoring stations. Census data was used to determine the numbers of people living in affected areas of Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho and Montana.  At least 38 million people live in counties subjected to pollution considered unhealthy for the general population for five days, according to AP’s analysis. That included more than 25 million people in California, 7.2 million in Washington, 3.5 million in Oregon, 1 million in Idaho and 299,000 people in Montana.  The state totals for the number of people exposed to unhealthy air on a given day were derived from counties where at least one monitoring site registered unhealthy air.  Scientists studying long-term health problems have found correlations between smoke exposure and decreased lung function, weakened immune systems and higher rates of flu. That includes studies from northwestern Montana communities blanketed with smoke for weeks in 2017.

Climate experts say residents of the West Coast and Northern Rockies should brace for more frequent major smoke events, as warming temperatures and drought fuel bigger, more intense fires.  Their message is that climate change isn’t going to bring worse conditions: they are already here.

La caratteristica regionale più sorprendente è stata l’ondata eccessiva di calore sopra la Siberia artica, dove le temperature medie hanno raggiunto i 10 °C sopra la media del mese di giugno in alcune località.  La temperatura media di tutto il territorio nella Siberia artica - spiega C3S - è stata di oltre 5 gradi al di sopra della norma e di oltre un grado superiore alla temperatura del periodo dal 2018 al 2019, che ha registrato i due mesi di giugno più caldi di sempre.  \"Trovare ciò che ha causato queste temperature record non è uno sforzo diretto in quanto vi sono molti fattori che contribuiscono a interagire tra loro - spiega il direttore di Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) di Ecmwf, Carlo Buontempo - La Siberia e il circolo polare artico in generale registrano grandi fluttuazioni di anno in anno e in precedenza hanno già sperimentato altri mesi di giugno relativamente caldi. Ciò che è preoccupante è che l'Artico si sta riscaldando più velocemente del resto del mondo. La Siberia occidentale ha sperimentato temperature più calde della media durante l'inverno e l’insolita primavera, inoltre le temperature eccezionalmente alte nella Siberia artica che si sono verificate a giugno 2020 sono motivo di preoccupazione\".  Inoltre, si ritiene che l'umidità del suolo inferiore alla media sia stata un fattore che ha contribuito all'aumento dell'attività degli incendi, concentrata principalmente nell'estremo nord-est della Siberia. Gli scienziati di Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (Cams), anch'esso implementato dall'Ecmwf, hanno monitorato l'attività degli incendi dall'inizio della stagione boreale fino all'inizio di maggio.  Il numero e l'intensità degli incendi nella Repubblica di Sakha e nell'Oblast autonomo di Chukotka e, in misura minore in parti dell'Alaska e dei territori dello Yukon, sono aumentati dalla seconda settimana di giugno e hanno portato alle emissioni stimate più elevate negli ultimi 18 anni del set di dati Cams. Per giugno, sono stati rilasciati nell'atmosfera un totale di 59 megatonnellate di CO2, che è superiore al totale di giugno dell'anno scorso di 53 megatonnellate di CO2.  Per Mark Parrington, Cams Senior Scientist ed esperto di incendi presso Ecmwf, \"ciò che è straordinario di questi incendi in Siberia è la sorprendente somiglianza con ciò che abbiamo visto nello stesso periodo dello scorso anno sia in termini di area colpita che di dimensioni degli incendi. L'anno scorso è stata di gran lunga un'estate insolita e da record per gli incendi nel circolo polare artico nel nostro Global Fire Assimilation System dataset, che risale al 2003. Quest'anno si è evoluto in modo molto simile e se continua a progredire come l'ultimo anno, potremmo vedere un'intensa attività nelle prossime settimane\".  \"Temperature più elevate e condizioni di superficie più asciutte stanno fornendo le condizioni ideali affinché questi incendi possano bruciare e persistere per così tanto tempo su un'area ampia. Negli ultimi anni abbiamo assistito a schemi molto simili nell'attività degli incendi e nelle anomalie dell'umidità del suolo in tutta la regione durante le nostre attività di monitoraggio degli incendi\", ha aggiunto.  I dati: giugno 2020 ha registrato temperature simili a quelle di giugno 2019, il mese di giugno più caldo di sempre, con temperature di 0.53°C sopra la media del periodo 1981-2010 durante giugno e in generale negli scorsi 12 mesi, la Siberia spicca come la regione dove si sono verificate le anomalie più importanti, l’Europa ha registrato temperature ben al di sopra della media a nord e al di sotto della media a sud, in generale giugno 2020 è stato il secondo mese di giugno più caldo di sempre per l’Europa.

The below piece is an answer to that question. Please click here to see even more perspectives on this important topic.  No matter who wins this November, one shouldn’t harbor any illusions of an overnight transformation. Just like the broader international system, the United States is grappling with structural shocks, including unprecedented ideological polarization, if not “culture wars,” in an increasingly social media-driven information landscape. Abroad, China has emerged as the one true peer and fully competitive rival, which could upend centuries of Western primacy in global affairs.  One could even argue that we are finally seeing the “real Cold War,” since the Soviets were never truly a peer and the so-called Cold War was far from “cold,” given its tens of millions of victims just during the Korean and Indo-China wars alone. And the coronavirus pandemic, which has hammered the global economy and rekindled geopolitical tensions with a toxic tinge of xenophobia and paranoia, will present a years-long if not a generational crisis for the foreseeable future.  Nonetheless, there are three reasons to be cautiously optimistic about the prospects for peace on the Korean Peninsula under a Joe Biden administration. First of all, American presidents, especially over the past half-a-century, have enjoyed significant latitude in matters of foreign affairs even if they have struggled with pushing through transformative domestic reforms under a heavily diffused political system which Francis Fukuyama has aptly called “vetocracy.”  Over the past decade, we have seen both the Obama and Trump administrations quickly overturning key pillars of their predecessor’s foreign policy initiatives, which only reinforced the power of the presidency just as it raised broader concerns over the coherence of American power projection in the world. And this takes us to the second point, namely the major policy changes one can expect if the Democrats manage to secure the presidency later this year.  Though far from a foreign policy dove, Joe Biden will likely use his presidency to restore major Obama-era global commitments, from the Paris Agreement on climate change to various arms-control regimes with Russia. There is a good chance that Washington will re-accede to the Iranian nuclear deal, which European powers continue to stand by. A restoration of frayed transatlantic relations will inevitably include coordination on shared geopolitical concerns in the Middle East, with Iran as a defining strategic priority. And this will inevitably have an impact on recent efforts to open communications channels with Pyongyang as part of a potential “grand bargain” between the United States and the North Korea regime.  In the past, we have seen how Democratic presidents built on groundbreaking initiatives by Republican predecessors, most prominently Nixon’s détente with Mao’s China, which laid down the foundation for four decades of “peaceful co-existence.” Trump’s historic and unprecedented summits with the North Korean leadership has rightly shattered the taboo of direct engagement in ways that makes even more sense than the once supposedly promising Sino-American rapprochement. On this issue, I expect the Biden administration to build on, rather than dismantle, the strategic gains of the current administration, which has combined pro-active diplomacy with relentless sanctions and pressure campaign.  In diplomacy, it takes two to tango, and as far as North Korea is concerned, we have a deeply authoritarian regime which is, nonetheless, led by relatively more forward-looking “millennial” leadership, namely Kim Jong-un and his siblings, especially the more even-keeled and astute Kim Yo-jong. With the coronavirus pandemic further devastating not only North Korea’s heavily-sanctioned economy but also its top partners in China and Russia, Pyongyang has growing reasons to keep the communications channels open. Geopolitics is a realm of unfathomable contingencies and uncanny tempest but, as things stand, the prospect for peace looks a tad more promising under a Biden administration.

Teen climate change activist Greta Thunberg’s name has been given to a newly-discovered snail species.  Details about the new snail, published on 20 February in the Biodiversity Data Journal, suggest that Craspedotropis gretathunbergae is highly sensitive to changes in both weather and temperature.  “Naming this snail after Greta Thunberg is our way of acknowledging that her generation will be responsible for fixing problems that they did not create. And it’s a promise that people from all generations will join her to help,” citizen scientist J.P. Lim explained in a press release.  Remember the beetle named after Greta Thunberg? Now there is a snail named after her too - Craspedotropis gretathunbergae pic.twitter.com/pbmwyBqCLs — Sarah Knapton (@sarahknapton) February 20, 2020  ​Taxon Expeditions, a Netherlands-based company that brings together citizen scientists and researchers for discovery expeditions, had organised the field trip to Brunei’s Ulu Temburong National Park, where the 2 mm-long molluscs with grey tentacles, a concave shell, and a \"buccal mass visible as a pink-orange globule\" were discovered.  The snails were discovered at the bottom of a steep hill-slope, alongside a river bank.  “The newly described snail belongs to the so-called caenogastropods, a group of land snails known to be sensitive to drought, temperature extremes and forest degradation,” said snail expert and co-founder of Taxon Expeditions, Dr. Menno Schilthuizen in the press release.  After the discovery, the expedition team along with staff from the National Park had taken a vote and ultimately decided to name the mollusk Craspedotropis gretathunbergae — after teen climate activist Greta Thunberg.  The authors of the paper, \"Craspedotropis gretathunbergae, a new species of Cyclophoridae (Gastropoda: Caenogastropoda)\", wrote:  \"We name this species in honour of the young climate activist Greta Thunberg, because caenogastropod microsnails from tropical rain forests, like this new species, are very sensitive to the droughts and temperature extremes that are likely to be more frequent as climate change continues.\"  According to the press release, Greta Thunberg, the Swedish schoolgirl who inspired a global movement to fight climate change and was named Time magazine's Person of the Year for 2019, was “delighted” to have this species named after her.  In 2018 the teenager had started an environmental strike by skipping lessons most Fridays to protest outside the Swedish parliament building, eventually sparking a worldwide movement under the hashtag #FridaysForFuture.  At the UN Climate Conference in New York in September 2019, Thunberg had blasted politicians for failing to dully tackle climate change in her now-famous speech, where she said:  \"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. We'll be watching you.\"  Previously, in 2018, Taxon Expeditions had named a new beetle discovered by citizen scientists at a waterfall in a remote part of Malaysia - Grouvellinus leonardodicaprioi - after another celebrity, actor and environmentalist: Leonardo DiCaprio.

The country is home to 2,967 wild tigers, roughly three-quarters of the world’s total remaining noncaptive population. And the cats are known to suffer from respiratory ailments, such as rhinotracheitis. But the announcement that a captive 4-year-old tiger at New York’s Bronx Zoo had tested positive for the coronavirus — the first confirmed case of the virus in a big cat — intensified concerns.  “This coronavirus could turn out to be very dangerous,” said Anup Kumar Nayak of the National Tiger Conservation Authority, the government agency charged with protecting India’s big cats. “We do not know what will happen in the future, but we are taking every precautionary measure. We have to take care of them.”  Nayak’s agency and India’s Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change have advised wildlife wardens in all states with tigers to restrict the movement of people into national parks, sanctuaries and reserves. Tigers must also be observed for respiratory symptoms, such as nasal discharge, coughing or laboured breathing, the authority said. Personnel relocating tigers that have been in conflict with people or handling sick cats would also need to be tested for the virus before any interactions with the animals.  At the time of the Pench tiger’s death, the agency had not established a protocol for coronavirus testing. Moving forward, veterinarians conducting post-mortem investigations will be required to collect and send samples to national laboratories.  In the two weeks since the advisories were issued, Nayak said wildlife wardens have not reported behavioural changes in tigers that would indicate any had become infected. But they continue to look out for more sick tigers.  India entered a nationwide lockdown March 24, but many wildlife workers have remained on the job. At Kanha Tiger Reserve in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, hundreds of rangers patrol the 362-square-mile area to protect the 90 endangered tigers estimated to live there.  “In Kanha, we have our own vets and veterinary hospital, so we are well prepared,” said L Krishnamoorthy, field director of the reserve. “It’s a concern everywhere, but we are very watchful.”  In a series of lab experiments at China’s Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, researchers demonstrated that the virus reproduces “efficiently” in domestic cats and can be transmitted by respiratory droplets between animals. The results were uploaded last month to a preprint website and have not yet been subject to peer review.  Scientists aren’t yet sure how the coronavirus could affect big cats in the wild. A controlled or modified setting, such as a lab or a zoo, doesn’t offer an accurate model for how species interact in an ecosystem. Chris Walzer, executive director of health at the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York, suggested that the virus may have spread to Nadia, the Bronx Zoo Malayan tiger, through pressure-washing of cages that vaporized the virus. Still, she only expressed mild symptoms — a cough and decreased appetite — as did six other big cats at the zoo.  Tigers are known to be vulnerable to rabies, anthrax and canine distemper, an often fatal morbillivirus commonly spread by stray dogs. The cats can also fall victim to feline infectious peritonitis, a disease caused by another coronavirus strain that affects the gastrointestinal tract.  India is likely exhibiting an overabundance of caution because of the fragile status of tigers in the country. And some critics say authorities are focusing on the wrong problem.  Ullas Karanth, director of the Centre for Wildlife Studies in India, thinks fears over the virus are misdirected. Illegal hunting of the tiger’s prey species for meat by desperate locals during the lockdown is a bigger threat to wild tigers than the disease itself, he said. Seven poachers were recently arrested in Bandipur Tiger Reserve with dead deer.  “There is a real surge in this kind of hunting,” Karanth said.  Other conservationists warn that because of the restrictions, impoverished people living near and in protected areas will be unable to collect subsistence products, like firewood and food. In a letter to the environment ministry, Ravi Chellam, an Indian wildlife biologist, and others urged officials not to restrict or evict villagers from protected areas.  “Indian wildlife faces far greater threats from habitat fragmentation, degradation, destruction, climate change, poaching and potentially many other diseases than from COVID-19,” Chellam said.  c.2020 The New York Times Company  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 8, "positive": 18, "negative": 18, "disgust": 5, "joy": 3, "anger": 10, "surprise": 1, "fear": 8, "trust": 5}, "metadata": ["indian", "reserves", "coronavirus", "virus", "protecting", "ministry", "climate", "interactions", "india", "lockdown", "lab", "researchers", "website", "scientists", "chris", "vulnerable", "centre", "studies", "prey", "surge", "threats", "habitat", "potentially", "diseases"]}, {"text": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Administrator Andrew Wheeler on Thursday announced new rules to reduce Obama-era methane pollution regulation.  Ahead of a Thursday event in Pittsburgh, Pa. -- the nation’s No. 2 gas state -- senior EPA officials told Fox News that the changes were \"the result of thoughtful cost-benefit calculations, [a] comprehensive assessment of the latest data, and appropriate application of the Clean Air Act.\"  The goal, they said, is to allow the oil and gas industry to innovate while also reducing redundancy and relieving convoluted reporting requirements for struggling midsize oil and gas companies as part of the administration's efforts to strengthen and promote American energy.  \"Today's actions do away with one of the worst kinds of regulations we saw from the Obama-Biden administration,\" an official stated. \"Regulations that have little effect in the real world in terms of protecting public health and the environment, but came with real costs that fell clearly on the backs of America's smaller oil and gas operators.\"  FOX BUSINESS: EPA TO RESCIND METHANE REGULATIONS FOR OIL AND GAS  The amended rules would exempt oil and gas wells -- drilled since 2016 -- that are producing less than 15 barrels a day from quarterly reporting requirements and put a stop to aggregating emissions from wells, compressor stations, and pipeline emissions.  In a controversial move, they would also end a 2016 requirement mandating oil and gas companies to install leak detection equipment and fix leaks when they are found in an effort to save money on compliance costs. Though, companies would still have to check equipment at some well sites and processing stations for smog-forming compounds.  Combined, the proposals are reportedly estimated to yield net benefits of $750 to $850 million from 2021 to 2030.  The new rules would go into effect 60 days after they are printed in the Federal Register, which could take a month.  Environmental advocates and critics of the plan argue that revoking the original methane emissions rule ignores a legal requirement for the agency to extend the rule to cover equipment installed before 2015.  Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that leaks from oil and gas wells during drilling and fracking, pipelines and compressor stations, and other parts of the natural gas distribution system.  Climate researchers report methane is over 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in trapping heat over the atmosphere over a 20-year-long period.  According to the EPA, the oil and gas industry is responsible for nearly 30% of America's methane emissions.  The long-anticipated act marks yet another step of the administration's continual rollback of environmental policies aimed at combating climate change, though Wheeler assured Wednesday that the regulations would continue to protect the environment while reducing industry costs.  That said, opponents of the plan and environmental activists could quickly take to court to block the update.  The Environmental Defense Fund announced Thursday that it would sue the EPA over the rollback.  They told The Associated Press that the new rules would allow emissions of an additional five million tons of methane to the already more than 13 million tons the industry emits.  CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP  A senior EPA official called their actions \"premature\" and asserted that there had been \"a significant amount of scientific, technical, engineering data and assessment\" that went into their decisions.\"  \"So, the notion that this regulatory action lacks a scientific basis...well, it's just straight-up dishonest,\" the official said, later assuring that their analysis showed emissions from U.S. sources would \"continue to go down.\"  Although industry representatives fear more expensive rules to stop emissions, not all gas companies are on board with the EPA's plan.  Shell, BP, and ExxonMobil have supported stronger federal methane regulations for both new and existing sources, and have all set methane emissions reduction goals.

SENATOR WARREN: NOT RIGHT NOW. >> I KNOW YOUR CAMPAIGN MANAGER SAID ON A CALL TODAY HE HAD NO REGRETS OR DO YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY? SENATOR WARREN: I HAVE NO REGRETS AT ALL. THIS HAS BEEN THE HONOR OF A LIFETIME. 10 YEARS AGO, I WAS TEACHING A FEW BLOCKS FROM HERE AND TALKING ABOUT WHAT WAS BROKEN IN AMERICA AND IDEAS FOR HOW TO FIX IT. PRETTY MUCH, NOBODY WANTED TO HEAR IT. I’VE HAD A CHANCE TO GET OUT AND TALK WITH MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. WE HAVE IDEAS NOW THAT WE TALK ABOUT THAT WE WEREN’T TALKIN ABOUT EVEN A YEAR AGO. A TWO CENT WEALTH TAX AND UNIVERSA CHILDCARE COULD BE REAL. WE COULD MAKE IT HAPPEN.

WE COULD ACTUALLY DO THI I’M DELIGHTED TO HAVE BEEN HERE AND HONORED TO HAVE HAD THIS JOURNEY. >> [INDISCERNIBLE] SENATOR WARREN: I WAS TOLD AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS UNDERTAKING THAT THERE ARE TWO LANES, A PROGRESSIVE LANE TH BERNIE SANDERS IS THE INCUMBENT FOR AND A MODERATE LANE THAT JOE BIDEN IS THE INCUMBENT FOR, AND THERE’S NO ROOM FOR ANYONE ELSE IN THIS. I THOUGHT THAT WASN’T RIGHT BUT EVIDENTLY I WAS WRONG. >> ABLE TO RESONATE MORE WITH VOTERS AND WHEN MANY STATES SENATOR WARREN:SENATOR WARREN: I WAS TOLD WHEN I FIRST GOT INTO THIS THERE ARE TWO LANES.

EVIDENTLY THAT WAS NOT THE CASE. >> WAS IT ESPECIALLY PAINFUL TO LOSE YOUR HOME STATE MASSACHUSETTS? SENATOR WARREN: I AM GREATLY -- I AM DEEPLY GRATEFUL TO THE PEOPLE OF MASSACHUSETTS. THEY TOOK A CHANCE ON SOMEONE COULD NEVER RUN FOR PUBLIC OUR OFFICE BEFORE, THEY OUSTED OUT REPUBLICAN SENATOR TO GIVE ME A CHANCE TO STAND UP ON A BIGGER PLATFORM AND FIGHT FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND I AM DEEPLY GRATEFUL F THAT. THEY RETURNED ME TO THE SENATE IN 2018 AND I’M DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR THAT. THEY ARE THE REASON I’M IN THIS FIGHT AND THEY ARE THE REASON I’M ABLE TO STAND HERE TODAY. >> TWO QUESTIONS. I SAW YOU VOTE TWO DAYS AGO FOR YOURSELF. CAN YOU REFLECT ON WHAT THAT WAS LIKE FOR YOU AND THE OTHER QUESTION IS, CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE ROLE THAT YOU THINK GENDER PLAYED IN THIS RACE? SENATOR WARREN: I WAS -- I STOOD IN TH VOTING BOOTH AND I SAW MY NAME ON THE BALLOT AND I THOUGHT, WELL KIDDO, YOU’RE NOT IN OKLAHOMA ANYMORE. THEN IT REALLY WAS A MOMENT OF THINKING ABOUT HOW MY BROTHER AND DAD IF THEY WERE STILL HERE WOULD FEEL ABOUT THIS. I HA GOTTEN ALONG EMAIL FROM MY NEPHEW, HOW PROUD HIS DAD, MY BROTHER IS. HOW THEY ALL HAD PLANS TO VOTE -- THESE LONG TIMES. THAT MOMENT STANDING IN THE BOOTH, I MISSED MY MOM AND MY DADDY. GENDER IN THIS RACE, YO KNOW THAT IS THE TRAP QUESTION FOR EVERY WOMAN. IF YOU SAY THERE WAS SEXISM IN THIS RACE EVERYONE SAYS HINER, AND IF THERE WAS NO SEXISM ABOUT A BILLION WOMEN THINK WHAT PLANET DO YOU LIVE ON. I WILL HAVE A LOT MORE TO SAY ON THAT SUBJECT LATER ON. >> A PLEDGE TO YOUR SUPPORTERS -- WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE TO THEM? I KNOW YOU’RE NOT ENDORSING ANYBODY. SENATOR WARREN: LET’S TAKE A DEEP WRATH AND THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A LITTLE LONGER BEFORE WE SETTLE IN. >> [INDISCERNIBLE] WHAT WERE YOU THINKING ABOUT? WHAT WAS T FINAL -- SENATOR WARREN: A BIG PART OF IT IS TO THINK ABOUT ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO TURNED THEIR LIVES UPSIDE DOWN TO BE PART OF THIS CAMPAIGN. ALL OF THE STAFFERS, WHO MOVED AND WORKED LONG HOURS GAVE UP JOBS TO BE HERE, TOOK LEAVES FROM SCHOOL, TO THI ABOUT WHAT WORKS FOR THEM. THIS IS A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE A BIG PART OF THIS, AND ALSO VOLUNTEERS. TO AND THINK THROUGH FOR ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HAVE INVESTED SO MANY HOURS AND SO MUCH OF THEIR HEART. THE PHONE CALLS, THE DOOR KNOCKS, COMING TO THE OFFICE TO HELP CLEAN THINGS UP AND KEEP IT ALL GOING. I TAKE THOSE PINKY PROMISES SERIOUSLY. THOSE ARE THE THINGS I NEEDED TO THINK THROUGH, AND HOW WE MAKE ALL THOSE PIECES WORK AS BEST WE CAN FOR EVERYONE. ONE LAST THING, IT’S ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE AFFECTED BY ALL THE ISSUES I’VE TALKED ABOUT , WHETHER THEY GOT INVOLVED IN MY FIGHT OR SOMEONE ELSE’S FIGHT OR NOT AT ALL, BUT HOWEVER WE TALK ABOUT THIS, THERE STILL IS A TRILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT WITH STANDING -- OUTSTANDING. THERE ARE STILL TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY WHO, ONE BAG MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS AND THEY ARE UPSIDE DOWN FINANCIALLY. THERE ARE STILL MAMAS AND DADDIES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY WHO CAN’T FINISH THEIR EDUCATION OR TAKE ON JOBS BECAUSE THEY CAN’T FIND ACCESS TO DECENT CHILDCARE THAT THEY CAN AFFORD. I HAD TO THINK A LOT ABOUT WHERE IS THE BEST PLACE FOR ME TO GO TO KEEP FIGHTING THOSE FIGHT BECAUSE THOSE PROBLEMS DON’T DISAPPEAR WHEN I STAND HERE IN FRONT OF YOU. THOSE PROBLEMS GO ON, AND MY JOB IS TO KEEP FIGHTING AND TO FIGHT THIS SMARTLY AND EFFECTIVELY AS I CAN. >> THANK YOU, SENATOR. [APPLAUSE] ERIKA: THERE SHE IS, SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN, GIVING UP THE RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE BUT NOT GIVING UP THE FIGHT FOR THE HARD-WORKING PEOPLE OF AMERICA. SHE SAYS THE QUESTION THAT REMAINS IS WHO WILL THE SENATOR NOW ENDORSE, THE MORE MODERATE JOE BIDEN, OR MORE LIBERAL BERNIE SANDERS. SHE HAS SPOKEN TO BOTH AND SHE IN THAT PRESS CONFERENCE THAT AN ENDORSEMENT WILL BE COMING THAT SHE NEEDS MORE TIME TO THINK ON IT.

Workers at the Brooklyn-based firm voted 46 to 37 to unionize in a first for major internet firms long known for providing generous pay and perks to employees.  \"We are a union,\" Kickstarter United, which was a voice for the union effort, tweeted in a message on Tuesday.  \"And to all tech and creative workers looking to fight for your rights, this is only just the beginning.\" Kickstarter workers will be affiliated with a New York City local of the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU).  \"I congratulate the workers of Kickstarter, the first major tech company to vote for a union,\" tweeted Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who is vying to be the Democratic Party contender in November's US presidential election.  \"These workers are setting an example for the entire industry.\" The OPEIU last year adopted a resolution to organize tech sector workers, citing an \"astronomical increase\" in interest in unionizing.  The union noted protests or petitions by employees at Amazon, Google, and video game studio Riot Games as signs that tech company workers are uniting to challenge decisions or conditions they find unacceptable in workplaces.  \"Engineers, web designers, programmers, developers and other tech workers are seeking a seat at the table to discuss the terms and conditions of their employment,\" OPEIU delegates said in the resolution.  Google workers have protested handling of sexual harassment complaints and vying for contracts with the US military. Amazon workers called on the company to do more to combat climate change.  Employees fired by Google late last year were dubbed the \"Thanksgiving Four\" on social media in an incident that highlighted deepening tensions at the firm, which said the workers violated data security policies.  But Google was accused of persecuting them for trying to unionize staff.  - 'Open the door' - The Kickstarter union certified by the National Labor Relations board provides a blueprint for tech workers keen to organize, according to analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group.  \"This is going to open the door to unionization. Now, people see you can do it,\" he said. \"It is in the union's best interest to go out and recruit now that they have a beachhead.\" He considered Amazon and Google as prime territory for unions since employees at both businesses have openly challenged management practices or decisions.  \"Unions are not just about salaries and perks, they are about preventing abuses -- like harassment and incredible overtime,\" Enderle said. \"They are for workers to address global issues without being called out by management.\" While engineers and designers might receive compensation envied by other professions, jobs can come with intense expectations and seemingly endless hours.  Also, tech company workers living in places such as Silicon Valley, where housing and other costs have rocketed, are seeing top executives reap lavish compensation, Enderle said.  California Labor Federation spokesman Steve Smith saw the Kickstarter union as reflecting a national trend among tech workers.  Issues from lengthy work weeks to discrimination and sexual harassment have bubbled in the sector for years, according to Smith.  Workers increasingly feel their \"only response is standing together in a union\" so they can have a collective voice and can fight back, Smith said.  According to US government statistics, 10.3 percent of American workers belonged to unions last year, down from 20.1 percent in 1983.

While the number of international students who newly enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities during the 2015-2016 school year stood at more than 300,000, by the 2018-2019 school year, that number had fallen by about 10% to less than 270,000.  This trend will undoubtedly accelerate in the fall of 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The American Council on Education predicts that overall international enrollment for the next academic year will decline by as much as 25%. That means there could be 220,000 fewer international students in the U.S. than the approximately 870,000 there are now.  One reason is that the U.S. has more COVID-19 cases than any other country. Other reasons include disapproval among international students regarding the U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic compared to other nations, the ongoing suspension of the processing of U.S. visas and negative perceptions of the Trump administration’s immigration policies and rhetoric.  As an international education professional, I foresee six major ways that the expected steep decline in international enrollment will change U.S. higher education and the economy.   1. Higher tuition  International students often pay full tuition, which averages more than $26,000 per year at public four-year institutions and $36,000 at private nonprofit four-year institutions. That matters because the tuition from foreign students provides extra funds to subsidize the costs of enrolling more students from the U.S. At public colleges and universities, the revenue generated from international enrollment also helps to make up for cuts in state funding for higher education.  One study found that for every 10% drop in state funding for higher education, international enrollment increased by 12% to 17% at public research universities from 1996 to 2012.  According to the Institute of International Education’s 2019 Open Doors Report, 872,214 international students are enrolled in U.S. colleges and universities.  As states cut budgets due to the loss of tax revenue brought on by the economic crisis caused by COVID-19, many institutions of higher education will be forced to raise tuition. While this may help college and university finances in the short term, in the long term it will make it more difficult for international students to be able to afford to study in the U.S., which in turn will make the U.S. a less attractive study destination.  Read:With coronavirus, policy makers have a rare opportunity to pressure top universities to make admissions fairer   2. A weaker economy  International students contribute an estimated $41 billion to the U.S. economy. However, the actual figure is surely much higher considering these students also pay various taxes to federal, state and local governments.  While a decline in international enrollment will financially hurt American colleges and universities, it will also decrease the profits of local businesses and the tax revenues of state and local governments. While college towns are likely to be the first affected, the long-term impact of fewer international students will ultimately be fewer jobs for Americans. How? Well, consider the fact that former international students founded nearly 1 out of every 4 startup companies in the U.S. individually valued at $1 billion dollars or more. Fewer international students now means fewer startups later.   3. Less innovation  One of the strongest factors that influences future international scientific cooperation is having students study in different countries. This ability to collaborate across borders is critical to addressing the world’s greatest challenges, from combating climate change to eliminating COVID-19.  Additionally, economists at the World Bank estimate that a 10% increase in the number of international graduate students in the United States raises patent applications in the U.S. by 4.5% and university patent grants by 6.8%.  Worldwide, research and development is valued at nearly $2 trillion. The U.S. share of that research and development is smaller today than it was in 2000. I believe having fewer international students will only serve to make it even smaller.   4. Job losses  One analysis found that international students support 455,000 U.S. jobs.  International students who participate in Optional Practical Training — a program that allows these students to gain practical experience in their field of study by working temporarily in the U.S. — help employers fill critical positions when they are unable to locate qualified U.S. workers. This is particularly true in certain science and engineering fields. The Trump administration is looking at putting restrictions on the program, it was reported on May 24.  As international enrollment declines, U.S. employers will have a harder time filling jobs. This may lead companies to look for talent in other countries — or possibly relocate jobs abroad.  Read:Telemigrants are coming for your white-collar job, and a wall won’t stop them  5. Less exposure to diversity  When students interact with people from cultures other than their own, it enhances their ability to think more critically. It also reduces prejudice.  Since only 10% of U.S. students study abroad prior to earning their bachelor’s degree, international students play an important role in exposing U.S. students who never go abroad to international perspectives. In essence, international students bring the world to campus and increase access to global learning for all. The result is a more globally competent workforce, which is important considering that 1 in 5 jobs in the U.S. is tied to international trade and 93% of employers value employees who can work effectively across national and cultural boundaries.   6. Less U.S. influence  While more than 300 current and former world leaders were at one time international students in the U.S., other nations are making concerted efforts to catch up. If there are fewer students from other countries studying in the U.S., it will lessen the ability of the United States to touch the hearts and minds of future world leaders.  David L.

His every decision affects 220 million inhabitants.  An international political, economic and financial cartel that branches from Nigeria to the United States via Lebanon, Dubai, the Netherlands and Italy. His interests lead to the development of a new business district in Lagos: Eko Atlantic City.  Within the project, foreign entrepreneurs, who have made their fortune, former army generals, local politicians and businessmen converge. A red thread that goes from the entrepreneurs of Lebanese origin Gilbert and Ronald Chagoury to the former dictator, Sani Abacha, to the businessman and leader of the political party PDP (in opposition today), Abubakar Atiku, and his right hand, the entrepreneur Italian Gabriele Volpi.  This block of power holds firmly in hand most of the affairs of the emerging African country. The names of the members are also associated with the main cases of corruption, misappropriation of public funds and alleged bribes that have passed through Nigeria in recent years. These also include the alleged $ 1.1bn stick for the OPL 245 oil license disputed between Eni and Shell.   The OPL-245 trial  The development of Eko Atlantic City began in 2013 and was entrusted without tender to a subsidiary of the Chagoury group, a family business that has grown to 20,000 employees today led by brothers Gilbert and Ronald Chagoury. The project was proposed by their South Energyx Development, based in the United Arab Emirates. Born in Lagos in the second half of the 1940s to Lebanese parents, the Chagoury brothers are the promoters of Eko Atlantic. If this real estate development exists, it is thanks to their network of contacts between Nigerian and international politicians they managed to obtain a 78-year concession.  According to a report by the Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority, the investment will be worth a total of $8bn, largely covered by four Nigerian credit institutions and by two international banks ready to guarantee the possible shortcomings of the former. Another entrepreneur works on the area together with the Chagoury, the Nigerian-Italian. Gabriele Volpi, known in Italy above all because he is the patron of the historic water polo company, Pro Recco and Spezia Spezia, which currently plays in Serie B. Volpi's investment, through three companies, Intels, Orlean Invest and Prime Property, to date it is $150m for phase one of development.  The Chagoury and Foxes are closely linked to pieces of Nigerian power, the former to the Abacha family, the latter to Abubakar Atiku. Both ended up under the magnifying glass of the American authorities for helping to bring public funds out of Nigeria that their political godparents had misappropriated. Reconstructions always denied by those directly concerned.  However, the United States Senate Standing Committee, which for a year investigated the issue of corruption in Nigerian political leadership, put down on white as \"for a period of eight years from 2000 to 2008\" Atiku and his wife had been in able to \"bring over $40m of suspicious funds to the United States mainly through transfers sent by offshore companies\", many of these attributable to Volpi himself. Gilbert Chagoury, on the other hand, defined by African business analyst, Philippe Vasset, as \"the guardian of the Abacha presidency\", following the death of Sani Abacha in 2009, agreed to return about $300m stolen from Nigeria by the dictator through his network of companies.  Eko Atlantic, the floating city at the crossroads of money and politics  Eko Atlantic City, the floating city crossroads of money and politics.  Operations starting immediately. A forest of skyscrapers. Fountains, paths, vertical woods. In fact, Eko Atlantic will be a free zone, capable of producing one billion a year of GDP for Nigeria, the twenty-sixth world economy and first in Africa if we look only at gross domestic product. A fully independent city and home to the big oil companies and the wealthy of the city, with apartments ranging from $1,800 to $3,000 per square meter and exclusive hotels. Surrounded by a protective wall of rocks, this peninsula of 10 square kilometres of sand dredged by the sea is the bet to drive out the recession that since 2014, after years of growth, affects the economic life of the country. Many believe in this project worthy of the ambitions of the Emir of Dubai, first of all the administration of Lagos, which has given the Emirate society of the Lebanese brothers Chagoury a 78-year concession on the fields at stake.  GIF: The evolution over the years of Eko Atlantic City from 2001 to 2019  The project has been approved, or at least \"publicised\", also on an environmental level, as a barrier to stop the erosion of the Lagos coast. The environmental impact study attached to the project states that \"it is a more complete and permanent solution to address the persistent erosion problem, which is likely to be exacerbated by climate change and the increase in storms\", which often causes deaths and floods in these areas. Hence, says the study, the need for the Lagos protective wall project and Eko Atlantic City. However, there are other evaluations that come to opposite conclusions, and see in the skeletons of skyscrapers under construction the omen of a future Atlantis. Remember Quartz Africa in a 2017 article that the environmental impact could produce the opposite effect for Lagos: starting from the poor neighbourhoods that are at water level, without anything protecting them from the tides, that the wall of Eko Atlantic City will head straight for them.  At the moment, the recovery of the plain is well under way, but not yet complete. From the boats with which the inhabitants of the slums shuttle between the two shores of the Lagos lagoon, the city emerged from the water appears far from being operational. Satellite images confirm this: for the most part, Eko Atlantic City is an expanse of sand, 90 million cubic meters to be exact. Visiting it is impossible: \"We appreciate the interest, but we don't give interviews at this time\", the press office cuts short. The works completed to date are the Pearl towers (where someone already lives), the skeletons of the three towers of the Azuri Peninsula to the South and the three buildings of Eko Energy City to the North, the Alpha 1 Tower and part of the road system.  The numbers of the Eko Atlantic City project  The delays can be found not only in the crisis in the Nigerian economy but also in the fear that is in investing in Nigeria after the renewed attention of local authorities on money laundering through real estate projects. The latter trend is enhanced by the anti-corruption campaign of President Muhammadu Buhari, which unleashes the investigative bodies very easily, only to arrive at modest results.  The doubts surrounding this project are not few. It seems impossible to transform an area lying at the mouth of a gray-green lagoon into a paradise for wealthy investors and tourists, constantly plowed by oil tankers and in the centre of a dense network of oil pipelines pumping crude oil towards the land. As much as the city is changing at full speed, the dream of becoming a new Dubai is still far from being realised. And those who risk being excluded, such as the evicted from the community on the opposite side of the Lagos lagoon, in Tarkwa Bay, are the clear majority of the 22 million inhabitants of Lagos.  The irresistible rise of Eko Atlantic developers  Both the Lebanese brothers, Chagoury, and the Italian, Volpi, began their ascent in the years when General Babangida, together with his deputy, General Sani Abacha, led Nigeria. The latter in 1993 became president with a coup d'état and history has dismissed his five-year presidency as a bloody dictatorship. Under him, the writer and activist Ken Saro-Wiwa, soul of the Ogoni people, was sentenced to death, who first denounced the environmental destruction committed by the oil multinationals, Shell at the top, in the Niger Delta region.  The Chagoury are not only close to the Abacha family, but they are also financiers and members of the Clinton Foundation, which in turn immediately believed in the Eko Atlantic City project. \"Everyone knows I'm a friend of the Clintons,\" Gilbert Chagoury told Frontline reporters in 2010. The foundation in 2009 pledged to secure the Eko Atlantic City project, promoting access to credit for a billion dollars. The Clintons' closeness cost some criticism at home, especially after the conservative Fox News broadcaster dusted off the news of an agreement in full conflict of interest – which the US State Department, led by Hillary at the time, had signed for the purchase of land in Eko Atlantic City.  Over time, the brothers capitalised on the US interest in the project so much that in May 2019, despite the change of administration at the White house, Chagoury Group signed an agreement between Eko Atlantic, represented by Ronald Chagoury in person, and the American Government for a new consulate right on the peninsula. After all, the two Lebanese brothers are able to move with politics: from the mid-nineties until 2017 Gilbert was diplomatic representative for the island of Santa Lucia, one of the main tax havens in the world: first as a UNESCO delegate, then as an ambassador at the Holy See. Another trait in common with Gabriele Volpi, who also enjoys good friends in the Vatican.   Eko Atlantic City relationships  But it is once again the Abacha family that act as a link between the kings of money of Eko Atlantic, Ronald and Gilbert Chagoury and Gabriele Volpi. Mohammed Sani Abacha, son of the former dictator, founded in 1998 and controls - via nominee - with former Petroleum Minister, Dan Etete, Malabu Oil and Gas, the company that holds the Opl245 oil license. This license, according to investigations by the Milan prosecutor for which the trial is currently underway, would then have been transferred to Eni and Shell, after the payment of a bribe of $1.1bn to Nigerian public officials.  During the hearings for the Opl 245 trial, Volpi was nominated only a few times, and is not among the suspects. Instead, he is a key person in the second investigation into Eni conducted by the Milan Public Prosecutor's Office, that of the false plot against the CEO, Claudio Descalzi. According to the accusatory hypothesis, the former legal consultant of Eni Piero Amara, together with collaborators and magistrates compliant in Trani and Syracuse, would have devised this intricate strategy to block the Opl 245 trial with a new judicial investigation. Eni has always rejected the hypotheses, claiming that Amara acted on its own. But according to the testimony of former oil technician, Massimo Gaboardi, one of the alleged entrepreneurs, who from Nigeria would try to bring down Descalzi, would be Gabriele Volpi in collaboration with businessmen active in Italy, Nigeria and United States. Curious circumstance: they are united by their closeness to the Clinton Foundation, with which everyone collaborates.  The Milan prosecutor's office is trying to unravel this inextricable tangle of truth, lies and simple coincidences. From Nigeria, there is at least one certainty: Eko Atlantic City, the Clinton friends' project, is the real estate deal of the century in Lagos.

On Sunday, The Washington Post editorial page led with a dramatic and rarely uttered fact check. The headline was \"There Are No 'Centrists': The Democratic primary race is not a choice between change and the status quo.\"  The article began by taking on an \"unchecked assumption\" that \"the candidates are fighting an ideological war between 'left' and 'center,'\" saying that the narrative \"is false, and hardly benign.\" It's now unfair to call the opponents of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren \"moderates\" when, in fact, all the candidates \"have put forward ambitious, progressive platforms for reducing inequality and promoting access to health and education.\"  The Post insisted, \"every major Democratic candidate is running on an agenda to the left of Mr. Obama's.\" In this new leftist paradigm, former President Barack Obama is now on the conservative side, even though Newsweek greeted his ascension in 2009 with a cover story headlined \"We Are All Socialists Now.\"  This was a candid and accurate admission by The Post. The same notion erupted on National Public Radio, of all places, this week the night before the New Hampshire primary. Reporter Scott Detrow acknowledged that Sanders is proposing a \"fundamental reordering\" of the government but said that doesn't mean Sanders' opponents are centrists.  \"I think this is the point in the conversation where we have to really stress that the moderate versus progressive divide is very relative,\" said Detrow. \"Every single one of these candidates -- almost every single one of these candidates has put together a platform that is far more progressive than what the Obama administration was able to accomplish.\"  NPR anchor Ari Shapiro summed up Detrow's statement: \"So everything's moved to the left.\" Exactly.  Detrow added: \"Even though Bernie Sanders did not get the Democratic nomination in 2016, the party as a whole has embraced a lot of his platform -- $15 minimum wage and health care. Even though there's this conversation about 'Medicare for All' or a public option, the premise of the conversation is giving everybody health care through a government-run program.\"  Despite this shocking admission, the NPR segment's online headline still said, \"Divide Between Moderate and Progressive Democrats Comes to Fore in New Hampshire.\"  These positions are hardly the only ones where the Democratic field toes an extreme line. The candidates are uniformly, radically in favor of abortion on demand with taxpayer funding. They are all in favor of the Equality Act, which would crush religious liberty in an effort to end \"discrimination\" against the \"LGBTQ community.\" They all want to dramatically ease up on enforcing the borders and provide illegal immigrants with taxpayer-funded health care.  On the international front, they are all eager to expand the federal government in a big crusade against the phantom menace called \"climate change.\" They all wish we were still participating in a phony nuclear agreement with Iran, and they all think it was wrong for President Donald Trump to take out Iranian terrorist mastermind Qassem Soleimani.  Despite all this, lazy journalists often stick to this false \"moderate\" terminology on the campaign trail. ABC anchor David Muir asked, \"Could Iowa be a make-or-break moment for moderates Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, who many believe need a strong showing here in Iowa tonight to keep going?\" NBC's Chuck Todd announced, \"Bernie Sanders won the progressive primary there in Iowa, and Pete Buttigieg won the moderate one.\"  CBS morning host Anthony Mason expressed concern to Joe Biden, saying, \"Mr. Vice President, you appear to be bleeding support from moderates.\" This kind of journalism is why the television networks are bleeding support from the American people.

The $3.6 billion plan to sink as many as 850 coal seam gas wells in and around the Pilliga State Forest west of Narrabri was given conditional approval by the Independent Planning Commission (IPC) on Wednesday morning.  The project has attracted both fierce opposition and support for more than 15 years since Eastern Star Gas struck the mineral in 2000.  The IPC heard largely opposition to the project during its record seven-day public hearing, and thousands of submissions.  But the IPC signed off on the scheme after commissioners spent six weeks considering the project. They imposed 134 conditions on gas development.  In its statement of reasons for the decision, the commission \"is satisfied\" that a potential threat to groundwater from the project \"can be effectively managed under the conditions of consent\".  Groundwater modeling performed by proponent Santos \"was considered fit for purpose for this approval\" the IPC said in its statement.  But the company will be required to improve its modelling over time.  The commission also rejected an argument that the project would unacceptably contribute to climate change through fugitive emissions.  Santos will be required to measure and minimise emissions at the project, and \"fully offset\" any emissions in excess of their budgeted amount.  Commissioners also rejected concerns about bushfire risk, Aboriginal heritage, social and health effects, biodiversity and waste management.  \"The commission considered the likely economic impacts of the project and is satisfied that on balance the project will provide a net economic benefit for the local community, region and state through increased investment and economic activity,\" the statement of reasons said.  Local MP Roy Butler, who opposes the project, said this week that government pressure has created \"question marks around approval\".  \"I think the key thing here is perception,\" he said.  \"You can have the most independent group in the world who has every check and balance to make sure that they are independent.  \"But if the public believe their independence has been compromised that's the what's they're going to believe and that's the lens they will look at the world.\"  Supportive Narrabri Mayor Ron Campbell, who took over from former mayor Cathy Redding just last week, said approval is \"simply a matter of law\" and is \"not a popularity contest\".  Politicians from both Commonwealth and state governments talked up the prospect of a 'gas-fired recovery' in recent weeks.  No other coal seam gas project nearing approval stage could fill a shortage business and political leaders have long warned could threaten local industry.  Santos has committed to start construction of the project \"shortly\" after it is approved.

Underscoring the \"massive and urgent support\" needed for developing countries, he echoed his call for a worldwide relief package of at least 10 per cent of the global economy's output.  He acknowledged steps taken by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) � $12.3 billion in emergency financing; the World Bank, with $160 billion of extra financing; and the G20 leading economies, which have agreed to suspend debt service payments for the poorest countries, but added, \"even this is not enough\".  Guterres maintained that a smart recovery from COVID-19 would help steer the world onto a \"safer, healthier, more sustainable and inclusive path\", but that it was \"critical to address the fragilities\".  The Secretary-General called on Governments to ensure that revitalized spending \"accelerate the decarbonization of all aspects of our economy and privilege the creation of green jobs\".  He also stressed that taxpayers' money not be used to subsidize fossil fuels or bail out carbon-intensive industries; a price should be placed on carbon; and public funds be invested in a future where financial institutions and investors take climate risks fully into account.  \"Our template remains the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Paris Agreement on climate change\", the UN chief said.  Guterres also recalled his global ceasefire appeal in March to face together the common enemy of COVID-19.  \"The cease-fire call has resonated widely\", he told journalists, however, as mistrust is challenging implementation, his envoys are \"working tirelessly�to turn expressed intentions into effective cease-fires\".  The Idlib cease-fire is holding in Syria, \"but we are still hopeful for a country-wide end to hostilities\", he said, adding that the UN is pushing in Afghanistan for a humanitarian ceasefire between the Government and Taliban fighters.  And although fighting in Libya has escalated, declarations made yesterday present \"a glimpse of hope that a cessation of hostilities remains possible\".  \"I believe there is an opportunity for peace in Yemen\", upheld Guterres, citing that all parties supported his appeal. Saudi Arabia has declared a temporary unilateral cease-fire, with the UN engaging with all actors to make it permanent, to restart the political process towards lasting peace.  Pointing out that the first two COVID-19 deaths were registered there on Wednesday, he said, \"it is time to recognize that the Yemeni people have suffered too much\".  \"All our efforts depend on strong political backing\", stressed the UN chief, sharing his hope the Security Council would be able to \"find unity and adopt decisions that can help to make ceasefires meaningful and real\".

The four days of convention programming showed a Republican Party whose policies are bound to Trump. But GOP divisions over many of those policies prevented much of the 2016 Trump agenda from ever becoming law. And that dynamic was in place well before the coronavirus pandemic changed politics.  \"This is the unifying national agenda that will bring our country together,\" Trump said on the final night of the convention in a speech that included sharp attacks on Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee. \"So tonight I say to all Americans, this is the most important election in the history of our country.\"  Republicans started their convention by readopting the same platform that propelled Trump to the White House in 2016. That platform included familiar goals of reforming immigration policy, building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, balancing the budget by 2026 and repealing the Affordable Care Act.  Longtime Trump backers like Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan say that's what voters want.  \"The American people appreciate the fact that he's done what he said,\" Jordan said in an interview. \"You go down the list: cut taxes, reduce regulations, lowest unemployment in 50 years prior to the virus.\"  Aside from the tax cuts and the updated North American Free Trade Agreement, the majority of the policies Trump now touts were done through executive actions, without agreement from Congress.  Republicans controlled Congress and the White House for Trump's first two years in office. During that time, the Republican Party was at an impasse on most major issues, like spending, immigration, infrastructure and health care.  But Jordan says a lot of those future plans would be made possible with the return of that full GOP control of the White House and both chambers of Congress.  \"I feel like he is going to win,\" Jordan said. \"And then I think the real question is, can we take back the House?  But the chances of the Republicans winning the House are slim. And Trump's convention speech — as well as the message from the four-day event — did not focus much on Congress, the House, the Senate or the partnership needed to implement the broad agenda.  One area that Jordan and other Republicans want to tackle is cutting spending.  But budget experts say that's a longtime GOP goal that candidate Trump embraced — and then largely ignored in office.  William Hoagland, a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center and a longtime adviser to Republican leaders in the Senate, said the debt and deficit have ballooned under Trump.  \"It's kind of perverse that they've even adopted the 2016 platform as the basis for going forward,\" Hoagland said. \"It is terribly inconsistent. But more importantly, on the issues that I'm concerned about from a fiscal perspective, it's somewhat hypocritical.\"  The deficit grew from $585 billion in 2016 to nearly a trillion at the end of 2019, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That spike is due in large part to policies that Trump enacted before the pandemic, like agreeing to spending increases in negotiations with Democrats and enacting the Republican-led tax cuts in 2017.  And that was before the coronavirus devastated the economy.  Hoagland said he expects the U.S. may have a deficit as high as $4 trillion next year.  \"My sense here is that there's a little bit of buyer's remorse that's starting to set in with some of the Republicans,\" Hoagland said. \"And I would like them to get serious about how they're going to address the increasing debt of this country.\"  But Republicans showed little political will to cut spending, even before the crisis. When it came to spending priorities, Trump was often forced to negotiate with Democrats to marshal enough votes to keep the government funded and avert a shutdown.  Another promise Trump made during the convention is to continue a hard line on immigration.  Immigration advocates like Daniel Garza, executive director of the Koch network group Libre Initiative, are holding out hope for remaking immigration policy in a second Trump term.  \"The fixed position of the Republican Party is that they want immigration reform that comes with strong security, and the fixed position of the Democratic Party is that they want a clean DACA bill,\" Garza said. \"I think there is room for negotiation. But it's going to take, I think, leadership.\"  Garza said he wants to see the two parties work together on legal immigration in a way that addresses the problem holistically — even if it isn't through a sweeping immigration bill that has been proposed in the past.  But Republicans are deeply split on what that kind of reform should involve. Bipartisan immigration talks have repeatedly crumbled in Washington, and a GOP-led effort, as well as various attempts by the White House to float new proposals, has failed to gain support from a majority of Republicans.  The issue has become more complicated in recent months as Trump has defied court orders to accept new applicants to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, and many congressional Republicans are opposed to reopening that debate.  Former GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo says if Trump is reelected, congressional Republicans must build their own policy goals.  \"If Donald Trump is in office, it becomes or it will remain more difficult to do that,\" Curbelo said in an interview. \"Even with united government, when there was general agreement, it was difficult. Now with divided Congress and this president, it's pretty much almost impossible to advance major legislation.\"  Curbelo was a Trump critic before he lost his Miami-area seat in 2018. He and Hoagland both say that some of the division within the Republican Party is the direct result of Trump's influence and the departure, either by retirement or through electoral losses, of moderate Republicans interested in cutting deals.  The former Florida congressman says Republicans will have to change if they want to survive in an era after Trump. That involves getting proactive about policies like immigration reform and climate change, which Curbelo says appeal to a younger, broader electorate that may lean more libertarian in their thinking.  \"If Republicans want to capture enough of those voters to be a majority party, they have to change,\" Curbelo said. \"They have to grow. They have to evolve.\"  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 15, "joy": 10, "negative": 18, "sadness": 1, "disgust": 3, "positive": 42, "anger": 6, "surprise": 16, "fear": 8, "trust": 13}, "metadata": ["week's", "convention", "trump", "term", "programming", "agenda", "coronavirus", "pandemic", "joe", "democratic", "presidential", "election", "republicans", "immigration", "affordable", "american", "agreement", "congress", "infrastructure", "chambers", "senate", "tackle", "adviser", "debt", "trillion", "agreeing", "avert", "advocates", "remaking", "sweeping", "split", "donald", "united", "climate", "capture"]}, {"text": "Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis arrived in Brussels on Thursday afternoon to take part in the work of the extraordinary European Council on the 2021-2027 European Union Multiannual Financial Framework.  Speaking at the Extraordinary Summit, the Greek Prime Minister said: “Today’s negotiation is crucial for Europe’s future. We are here to discuss the size of the European budget for the next six years. One thing is for sure; we cannot do more with less. That is why, if we want to set ambitious goals, as we have, we must also have the corresponding resources to be able to achieve them”.  Regarding Greece, Kyriakos Mitsotakis pointed out that he was heading to this negotiation process with a clear national line: “We want to safeguard our farmers’ incomes as much as possible, but also to help them make the transition in a way that is more environmentally friendly”.  He further stressed that Greece was seeking more development funds, which meant a “larger NSRF, so that we can further support the strong growth we have already been witnessing in the Greek economy, create more and better-paid jobs, and especially in the rural areas”.  “We are claiming resources that will enable us to make a fair transition to a low-emissions economy. We also demand solidarity through actions, not just words, when it comes to addressing the refugee/migration issue and in guarding the border, since the Greek borders are also European borders”, he continued.  “It will be a complicated debate”, the Greek Prime Minister added. “My position has been clear from the very beginning. No one can expect us to do more with less. We need a larger file if we are to support all together traditional policies, such as Cohesion and the Common Agricultural Policy, while also being more ambitious about policies related to climate change and border management.  Therefore, I expect a complicated and difficult debate but at some point we all need to agree on the level of ambition. If we are to be very ambitious, we need more resources”.  Kyriakos Mitsotakis expressed his belief that it would be a difficult and lengthy negotiation, but said he was “cautiously optimistic that we could find a solution that is mutually acceptable”.  Asked if Greece receives more money for refugees, the Greek Prime Minister responded that “Unfortunately, the total resources available for refugee and border guarding in relation to the original proposals are scarce. This is a mistake. It is a mistake because we cannot at the same time claim that we have Europe which protects its citizens while not having the resources necessary to provide even more financial support for the countries that are at the forefront, and to support Frontex, which is the European border guard force. In any case, the resources that the country will receive for these issues will be increased compared to the previous programming period”.

Sempre avendo ben presente che l’education viene prima del business e che è indispensabile conoscere per investire. E' quanto emerso dal convegno \"Green Deal. La sostenibilità aiuta la ripartenza. Idee verdi e Recovery Fund per uscire dal coronavirus\", organizzato dalla Fondazione Istud con il patrocinio del ministero dell’Ambiente oggi in diretta streaming online sul sito di AdnKronos.  Il ministro Costa. Dall'incontro sono arrivate proposte al Governo e che il ministro dell'Ambiente Sergio Costa si è detto disponibile ad accogliere per sveltire e snellire il quadro normativo per far sì che la ‘versione green’ decolli. (Il videomessaggio del ministro Costa). A partire dal carburante del futuro che sostituirà la benzina: l’idrogeno e l’elettrico.  La mobilità del futuro, dall'idrogeno all'elettrico. \"La filiera industriale dell’idrogeno è assolutamente pronta a investire, anche nei treni - dice Alberto Dossi, presidente del Gruppo Sapio - Ma per fare questo è necessario che il decisore politico supporti con incentivi e defiscalizzazioni, e con un quadro normativo, regolatorio e legislativo chiaro e di lunga durata che sia abilitante per gli investimenti\". Occorre puntare sui distributori. La Francia sta investendo 7 miliardi, la Germania 9 miliardi. In Italia al momento abbiamo solo quattro stazioni di rifornimento.  Per Cristiano Musi di Landirenzo Group, \"l’idrogeno rappresenta con certezza un’alternativa e fonte tecnologica imprescindibile per la mobilità sostenibile e zero-emission del futuro in ottica 2050, con una penetrazione che riteniamo potrà iniziare già a partire del 2025\". Il futuro? \"La convivenza di diverse tecnologie diminuzione delle emissioni e rendere green la mobilità. Gas naturale e gas naturale liquefatto e in futuro l’idrogeno sostituiranno il diesel\".  Sul tema è intervenuto anche Michele Ziosi, vice presidente Institutional Relations Europe & Amea di CNH Industrial. \"La nostra road map tecnologica è verso un diesel pulito e il gas naturale. E’ fondamentale che ognuno faccia la sua parte, che esista un ecosistema per andare verso questa direzione\". Antonio De Bellis, eMobility Lead Manager di Abb Electrification Italia, punta sull’elettrico. \"Attendere come Italia per implementare seriamente la transizione all’elettrico, vuol dire incrementare il divario con gli altri paesi Ue e non, nonché creare una forte dipendenza da terzi come energeticamente abbiamo sempre fatto. Che si voglia o no, il futuro c’è già ora e si tratta solo di implementarlo gestendo gli effetti\". A partire da quelli climatici.  Lo ricorda Valentino Piana dell’University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland di Valais, secondo il quale i negoziati climatici globali devono raggiungere e superare gli impegni già presi, in modo da favorirne di nuovi ancora più avanzati. \"Serve calare del 9% ogni anno le emissioni. Accrescere la capacità di adattamento. Affrontare, anche col settore privato delle assicurazioni, il tema delle perdite e danni climatici\", dice.  Anche per il settore del riscaldamento degli edifici, tutt’oggi ancorato all’uso dei combustibili fossili che rappresenta la principale fonte di inquinamento nelle aree urbane, è \"possibile avviare una trasformazione verde verso un nuovo modello di città sostenibile a zero emissioni\", aggiunge Riccardo Bani, presidente di Teon. La tecnologia c’è, le capacità anche, bisogna rivedere le parti normative rendendole funzionanti.  La parola chiave è responsabilità. Lo hanno ricordato sia Daniela Aleggiani di 3M Italia sia Romano Stefani, direttore commerciale di Dolomiti Energia, portando le esperienze di responsabilità sociale, sostenibilità e le scelte di campo delle proprie aziende, anche durante l'emergenza Covid.  All'ordine del giorno anche il tema 'economia circolare'. Su recupero e riciclo, per Roberto Sancinelli, presidente di Montello, \"serve una direttiva europea, coercizione normative, obbligatorietà\", ma l’industria italiana, sottolinea Roberto Cavallo, amministratore delegato di Erica \"è più avanti di vent’anni rispetto alla normativa, occorre fare sistema intervenendo sulle aree in ritardo. Ad esempio sulle plastiche. Quando hanno chiuso le frontiere cinese ce ne siamo accorti con roghi ovunque. Nell’arco dei due anni scoppierà la ‘bomba’ del tessile. Non abbiamo filiera\".  L’agricoltura è un modello circolare, ma la risorsa suolo è quella più danneggiata al momento. Per Carlo Triarico, presidente dell’Associazione agricoltura biodinamica e vice presidente di Federbio, bisognerebbe puntare sull’agricoltura biodinamica \"che non ha ancora una legge di settore, e si ritorna alle mancanze normative\".  L’Italia potrebbe essere una capo fila con un modello di agricoltura ecologica biodinamica del futuro ma tante le difficoltà. \"Nel mondo le rese della superficie arabile dovranno aumentare del 90% ma senza inquinare. Questa rivoluzione agricola avviene pagando un prezzo. La digitalizzazione – ha detto Nicolò Mascheroni Stianti, chief revenue officer di Abaco Group - Non ci possiamo aspettare una digitalizzazione dell’agricoltura in pochi anni. Trasformazione digitale dell’agricoltura che ci aiuta a risolvere il problema ambientale e degli sprechi\".  Nelle conclusioni il professor Alessandro Marangoni , ceo di Althesys Strategic Consultants, sintetizza che \"il progresso tecnologico, con il calo dei costi dello storage e soluzioni futuribili come l’idrogeno e il p2g, potrà dare una spinta, ma serve creare le condizioni di mercato normative e regolatorie che favoriscano gli investimenti. Diversamente il Piano Energia Clima italiano (che peraltro andrà rivisto alla luce dei nuovi target UE) resterà un libro dei sogni\". Insomma il Green Deal, chiude Paolo Peroni di Roedl & Partner, \"è la risposta europea ai pericoli generati dal climate change ma è anche una straordinaria opportunità di rilancio dell’economia nella direzione della sostenibilità\".

Advertisement Wildfires taint West Coast vineyards with taste of smoke Share Shares Copy Link Copy  Smoke from the West Coast wildfires has tainted grapes in some of the nation's most celebrated wine regions with an ashy flavor that could spell disaster for the 2020 vintage.Wineries in California, Oregon and Washington have survived severe wildfires before, but the smoke from this year's blazes has been especially bad — thick enough to obscure vineyards drooping with clusters of grapes almost ready for harvest. Day after day, some West Coast cities endured some of the worst air quality in the world.No one knows the extent of the smoke damage to the crop, and growers are trying to assess the severity. If tainted grapes are made into wine without steps to minimize the harm or weed out the damaged fruit, the result could be wine so bad that it cannot be marketed.The wildfires are likely to be \"without question the single worst disaster the wine-grape growing community has ever faced,” said John Aguirre, president of the California Association of Winegrape Growers.Winemakers around the world are already adapting to climate change, including rising temperatures and more frequent, more severe droughts. Those near fire-prone forests face the additional risk that smoke could ruin everything.“Unfortunately, climate experts are telling us this is going to be a problem,” said Anita Oberholster, a wine expert at the University of California, Davis. “And so we need to do better. We need to do loads more research.”With this year's harvest underway, some wineries are not accepting grapes they had agreed to purchase unless they have been tested for smoke taint, Aguirre said. But laboratories are too backed up to analyze new orders in time.ETS Laboratories, in the Napa Valley town of St. Helena, California, says test results on grape samples received now will not be ready until November. New clients will have to wait even longer for results, according to the lab's website.In every grape he has come across, Noah Dorrance, owner of Reeve Wines in Healdsburg, California, told the San Francisco Chronicle, “you could already taste and smell this ashy, barbecued flavor, kind of like a campfire.”Aguirre recalled sampling smoke-damaged wine during a tasting. One description on a tasting card compared the flavor to “fecal plastic.”“I tasted it and I went, ‘Oh, my God. Bingo,’ ” Aguirre said.The issue comes down to compounds called volatile phenols, which are released when wood burns and can be absorbed by grapes, Oberholster said.The compounds are naturally present in grapes. But when their levels get too high, they can impart the foul tastes, \"and obviously that’s not a character most people want in their wine,” Oberholster said.Australian wine researchers were the first to notice the risks. In 2003, they linked smoke in the atmosphere to a taint in wine, said Mark Krstic, managing director of the Australian Wine Research Institute. From then until 2015, Australian producers lost more than $286 million ($400 million Australian) in grapes and wine revenue as a result of smoke.The problems continue. Australia’s most recent fire season was “horrific,” Krstic said.\"Basically the eastern seaboard of Australia was pretty much on fire and extended across many wine regions,” he said in a phone interview.In the forested foothills bordering Oregon's Willamette Valley, flames smothered the region, famous for its cool-climate pinot noirs, in thick yellow-brown smoke.“Pinot noir is a very thin-skinned grape, meaning it’s very delicate in nature, and you can’t mask any type of flaws in the growing condition or in the winery,” said Christine Clair, winery director of Willamette Valley Vineyards in Turner, Oregon.Jim Bernau, founder of Willamette Valley Vineyards, said of the smoke: “I’ve been here growing wine grapes for over 38 years, and I have never experienced or seen anything like this as a wine grower.”By last weekend, rain and shifting winds had cleared the skies. Bernau believed many Oregon wineries would escape damage because the smoke did not linger too long.His winery has been fermenting small samples to gauge whether smoke affects the resulting wine. In the samples for white and rosé wines, yeast is introduced into juice that was hand-squeezed from the grapes, with the skins immediately removed.“After just about two days, you can have a pretty good idea if that juice that now became wine is viable,” Clair said. The results indicated a low risk of smoke taint for the whites and rosés.In fermenting red samples, the skin is left on. Initial results are also promising, but the winery is prepared to turn some of the grapes with heavier smoke exposure into rosé instead of red wine, Clair said.The wine industry had already been hammered this year by the coronavirus and shutdown of restaurants, bars and wine tasting rooms.“I’m fully expecting a plague of locusts to descend and maybe 40 days of night,” Aguirre said. “I mean, it’s just nuts.”But the West Coast's 2020 “wildfire vintage” — as some winemakers are already calling it — might not be so bad.In 2018, a California company abruptly canceled contracts to buy grapes worth millions of dollars from southern Oregon vineyards, claiming fears they were tainted by wildfire smoke. Four Oregon wineries stepped in, bought the grapes and produced “Oregon Solidarity” wines.They got good reviews.—Associated Press writers Nicholas K. Geranios in Spokane, Washington, and Haven Daley in Davis, California, contributed to this report.
