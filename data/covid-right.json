{"data": [{"text": "PRAYER PLEDGE: Rally around the daily Rosary to stop the coronavirus Sign the petition here.  March 23, 2020 update: On March 19, the official French-speaking website of the seminary stated, “As expected, the virus did its work in the seminary, and now most priests and half of the seminarians are sick.” Priests and seminarians living in Wigratzbad were officially tested for coronavirus only on March 20. Nonetheless, a great number of them were showing symptoms at the time. After the weekend, on Monday, March 23, the seminary reported on “a marked improvement today at the seminary since the number of seriously ill patients is less than ten.”  OPFENBACH, Germany, March 20, 2020 (LifeSiteNews) – Almost all priests and roughly half of the seminarians currently at a German seminary of the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter (FSSP), a traditionalist community of priests and seminarians, have been infected by the coronavirus.  On the evening of March 13, the seminary had first announced that a priest, who stayed at the seminary as a guest, had contracted the virus. At the time, the community, which is dedicated to the celebration of the Traditional Latin Mass, had stated that all Masses in Wigratzbad would take place without the seminarians joining.  “With the powerful help of faith, hope and charity, we do not let ourselves be discouraged. In a few days, the first healed ones will be able to take over from the newly sick, to maintain the spiritual and material life of the house,” the seminary community wrote.  Since God only allows evil for the sake of a greater good, the community expressed its confidence in the Lord “who alone is able to give meaning to our temporary existence on this earth.”  Since the reception of Holy Communion on the tongue had already been banned, the FSSP declared that only the celebrant would receive the Eucharist. The faithful were encouraged to do a spiritual communion.  On the next day, the French blog of the seminary, which has a German-speaking and a French-speaking section, clarified that the priest first infected was from Italy.  “The whole seminary has been in strict confinement for a week, because the disease spreads rapidly. A dozen priests and seminarians are showing flu-like symptoms, forcing us to completely reorganize schedules and services. Cooks, cleaners, secretaries … we have to do everything by ourselves, but everyone is generous and adapts without difficulty.”  The community is using the quarantine to meditate on the meaning of life.  “Life is short and fragile, and if one is worried about one’s health, one must be even more concerned about one’s salvation. The invisible threat of illness stimulates us to trust more in God, and to increase our prayers and penances even more,” the French blog wrote.  Earlier this week, the government prohibited gatherings of any kind in churches, meaning the public is now no longer able to participate in Mass in Wigratzbad.  This year, 90 seminarians are preparing for the priesthood in Wigratzbad. The community received 30 new seminarians last fall.  Meanwhile, 59 religious sisters in Italy have been tested positive for coronavirus.  Just outside of Rome, one convent of the Daughters of St. Camillus, composed of 40 sisters, was isolated. Additionally, 19 members of the Angelic Sisters of St. Paul, also located outside of Rome, were diagnosed with coronavirus.  According to a report by Catholic News Agency, 28 priests in Northern Italy have already died of coronavirus.  “Avvenire, the Italian newspaper owned by the Italian bishops conference, attributes at least 28 of these priests’ deaths to COVID-19, and also notes two additional cases: that of Fr. Guido Mortari, who died of pneumonia before he could get tested, and Fr. Giorgio Bosini, who had a serious underlying medical condition,” Courtney Mares wrote.  The vast majority of priests who died were over 70 years old. The youngest died at 54.

The board also approved incentives to promote technology-based \"smart farming\", as well as research and development in other sectors.  \"In face of the unprecedented situation resulting from the virus outbreak, we have taken a range of measures to address the urgent needs of affected business sectors,\" Duangjai Asawachintachit, secretary-general of the BOI, said after a board meeting chaired by Prime Minister Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha in Bangkok.  \"The measures for the medical sector aim to enable a rapid response to the situation, while paving the way for longer-term development.\"  To address increased demand for medical equipment and supplies resulting from the outbreak, the BOI approved amendments to BOI-eligible businesses and enhanced benefits related to the medical sector with a view to accelerating investment in production of medical equipment and supplies.  Support will also be given for the modification or transformation of existing production lines to boost availability of medical supplies, Duangjai told a press conference held online to respect social distancing rules.  Measures approved on Monday include the following.  Accelerating investment in medical sector:  1. Tax holidays of three to eight years and a 50 percent cut in corporate income tax for an additional three years for eligible investments in the medical sector. Examples include the production of medical devices and parts, non-woven fabric used as raw materials in the production of medical supplies, diagnostic test kits, drugs, and active pharmaceutical ingredients. This measure covers projects that apply between January 1 and June 30 and must start production and generate income by December 31 this year. Distribution or donation domestically of at least 50 percent of the output must take place in 2020-2021.  2. A measure to support the adjustment of existing production lines to manufacture medical devices or parts by exempting import duties on machinery on the condition the equipment is imported within 2020 and the application for production line adjustment is filed by September 2020.  3. Adjustments to benefits granted for production of raw materials used in the manufacture of medical products, to encourage a more complete value chain in Thailand. For instance, pharmaceutical grade alcohol production is now entitled to an eight-year corporate income tax exemption. Additional benefits granted for production of non-woven fabric used as raw materials for medical masks or medical devices, by expanding the corporate income tax exemption from three to five years.  Temporary relaxation of investment conditions:  The BOI agreed to relax deadlines in cases such as the duty-free importation of machinery and the full operation start-up, as well as waivers for applications for temporary cessations of operations for a period of more than two months.  Support for research and development:  The BOI broadened the scope of activities eligible for duty-free importation of materials used in research and development to cover all activities required to conduct R&D.   Encourage smart farming development:  To encourage investment in technologies supporting the modernisation of the agricultural sector and allow local start-up enterprises to participate in the overall development of digital platforms, the BOI simplified conditions of investment in smart farming while retaining attractive tax incentives.  Approval of Mitsubishi Motors' EV investment:  The BOI also approved an application from Mitsubishi Motors (Thailand) Co, Ltd with total investment of Bt5.48 billion to upgrade the company's existing car production line in Laem Chabang for the production of electric-powered cars. The project plans production of 39,000 vehicles per year, consisting of about 9,500 battery electric vehicles (BEV) and about 29,500 hybrids. The production, to launch in 2023, will aim at the local market and exports to other Asean countries.  Investment applications in January-March 2020  During the first quarter of 2020, the number of applications submitted to the BOI increased slightly to 378 from 368 in the same period last year. However, the lower average project size led to the total value of applications declining 44 percent to Bt71.38 billion on last year’s equivalent period. Foreign investment totalled Bt27.43 billion, representing 38 percent of total investments. The top three foreign investment sources were Japan, China and Hong Kong.

Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said she's confident the country has enough food and stopped short of suggesting Canadians start growing war-era \"victory gardens\" to supplement their own supplies.  But everything from a potential labour shortage on farms to COVID-19 outbreaks among workers at food processing plants will have an impact, she said.  \"I think our system is strong enough and resilient enough that it will adapt, but these days it is particularly challenging,\" Bibeau said during a video news conference Wednesday, where she fielded questions from her home in Sherbrooke, Que.  \"I do not worry that we will not have enough food,\" she added.  \"But we might see some differences in the variety and, hopefully not, but maybe in the prices as well.\"  The federal government has announced millions in new spending for farmers this week alone, including $20 million for the Canadian Food Inspection Agency so it can have enough inspectors on hand to carry out its work.  The funds are partially designed to guard against the potential for CFIA inspectors to be stricken with the virus and be unable to work, further slowing down an already struggling supply chain.  The other labour issue facing the industry is a farm worker shortage. Some 60,000 temporary foreign workers come to Canada annually to work on farms and in plants but border closures mean fewer are expected this year.  They are also required to quarantine for two weeks upon arrival, and this week, the federal government announced $1,500 per worker to help employers cover salary payments or revamp living quarters to ensure workers can abide by distancing protocols.  Checks on those measures will be carried out by local, provincial and federal authorities, Bibeau said.  Workers' rights group Justicia for Migrant Workers has raised concerns the onus is actually being placed on workers — not their employers — to comply.  They cite a video being produced by the Ontario Provincial Police telling workers in Spanish what their obligations are, and say there are already efforts by communities to \"name and shame\" migrant labourers.  \"We find it disconcerting that local community members are so concerned about migrant workers' social distancing while in public, yet do not share the same concerns regarding the lack of protections and accommodations provided by the employer to ensure that migrant farm workers are able to socially distance in their workplace and home,\" they said in a statement Wednesday.  The arrival of temporary foreign workers is being stymied by global travel restrictions, and what's ordinarily an annual shortage of several thousand workers is likely to be made worse, Bibeau said.  The government is examining efforts to get unemployed or under-employed Canadians into jobs on farms, she said.  That's despite the fact that the very reason the temporary foreign worker program exists is due to Canadians not wanting those jobs — and farmers don't necessarily want to hire them either, as the work can require extensive training. Many workers return to the same area every year because they've developed a specific skill set.  \"It's a challenge, but we have to do even more to encourage them to join the industry,\" Bibeau said of the workers the government hopes to recruit.  Another issue facing the sector is outbreaks in processing plants. An Olymel pork processing plant northeast of Montreal reopened this week after the spread of illness among its workers forced a two-week shutdown.  The Cargill Meat Solutions plant south of Calgary, which represents more than one-third of Canada's beef-processing capacity, announced this week it is idling its second shift of workers.  The union representing those staff said there have been 38 cases of COVID-19 at the plant in High River, Alta.  Bibeau said she is reviewing a pitch by the cattle industry to help weather the crisis. The Canadian Cattlemen's Association wants a federally co-ordinated \"set-aside\" program that would enable producers to keep their animals longer.  The program would slow down the supply chain because there's not enough processing capacity, the group has said.  The Conservatives called Wednesday for Bibeau to immediately implement that program and be far more transparent about what else the government is examining.  \"Farmers, producers and processors work hard day and night to ensure that Canadians have the food they need while they stay home,\" three Conservative MPs who work on agriculture issues — John Barlow, Richard Lehoux and Lianne Rood — wrote in a letter to Bibeau.  \"These hard-working Canadians need to know that their jobs will be safe during this pandemic and that they can continue to produce world class products.\"  This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 15, 2020.

If this was true, why are clinical trials for intravenous vitamin C underway in China?  Reflect On:Can we rely on our medical system to provide the best possible solutions, or will profit always come first? How much trust have they lost among the general population over the years?  An article published by LiveScience, a mainstream science website, states that “Vitamin C is extremely unlikely to help people fight off the new coronavirus.” Mainstream media has been attacking the idea that vitamin C could have some potential to prevent or even treat the new coronavirus. This rhetoric follows statements that have come out from government health regulatory agencies. Take Health Canada, for example, who recently tweeted that there are no natural health products “that are authorized to protect against” the new coronavirus. They go on to state that “any claims otherwise are false.”  This is a problem that’s plagued our world since the introduction of the mainstream medical industry. Arnold Seymour Relman, a former Harvard professor of medicine and former Editor-in-Chief of The New England Medical Journal, states this problem clearly:  “The medical profession is being bought by the pharmaceutical industry, not only in terms of the practice of medicine, but also in terms of teaching and research. The academic institutions of this country are allowing themselves to be the paid agents of the pharmaceutical industry. I think it’s disgraceful.” (source)  The question people need to be asking is, where does government loyalty lie? Perhaps it’s with the industry that spends two times more than any other lobby in congress. This is why nothing can be used as a treatment, for any disease, unless it’s patented and presented to us by a pharmaceutical company. “Alternative” treatments are always branded as ‘fake’ and even ‘dangerous’.  Vitamin C Trials and Treatment  This recent coronavirus outbreak might provide the latest insight into this matter. Going back to the statement above from LiveScience that states “Vitamin C is extremely unlikely to help people fight off the new coronavirus”: if this is really the case, then why would China start multiple clinical trials to examine whether or not intravenous vitamin C can be helpful in treating people with coronavirus?  The article in LiveScience did not acknowledge this originally, but they added an update stating that researchers at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University had launched a clinical trial with 140 patients in February to test whether ultrahigh doses of vitamin C, delivered intravenously, could treat the viral infection more effectively than a placebo. The test group will receive infusions twice a day for seven days, with each infusion containing 12g of vitamin C. (The daily recommendation for an adult man is only 90mg.) The trial will be completed in September, and no results are yet available, according to ClinicalTrials.gov.  That being said, Dr. Richard Cheng, MD, has been updating everyone via his YouTube channel about vitamin C treatment cases out of China. We have been covering his updates as he is in direct contact with this treatment and isn’t simply an armchair scientist at the moment. We feel at this time this is a very important detail as he is seeing and hearing results first hand, not simply theoretically. Dr. Cheng is a US board-certified anti-aging specialist. He claims that vitamin C is now in the Shanghai Government treatment plan.  Dr. Cheng was paramount in bringing high-dose vitamin C to the table as part of potential treatment and prevention measures. Unfortunately in the West, this option is still being denied by much of mainstream media and governments are not talking about it. Instead, it’s fear and chaos which we do not feel helps anyone to stay healthy or get better.  According to Cheng, 50 moderate to severe cases of Covid-19 infection were treated with high-dose IVC. Dosing of IVC ranged from 10,000 – 20,000 mg a day for 7-10 days, with 10,000 mg for moderate cases and 20,000 for more severe cases. The first bit of good news was that all patients who received IVC improved and there has been no mortality. Secondly, as compared to the average of a 30-day hospital stay for all Covid-19 patients, those patients who received high dose IVC had a hospital stay of about 3-5 days shorter than the other patients.  In one particularly severe case where the patient was deteriorating rapidly, an extra dose of 50,000 mg IVC was given over a period of 4 hours and it caused the patient’s pulmonary (oxygenation index) status to stabilize and improve as the critical care team observed in real time.

COVID-19 is more than a potentially fatal disease, it's another barrier to getting back home.\"It's like it'll never be,\" said Susan Goldstone, who has been trying to rebuild her family home in Oceanside for more than seven years. \"It's just a very stressful feeling. I don't know how to describe it.\"Goldstone is among the 814 individuals, largely in Nassau and Suffolk counties, who received notices from New York States' recovery program, dubbed NY Rising, warning them they had until March 13 to schedule a final inspection or potentially lose the \"ability to keep funds awarded.\"The program promised more than 11,000 applicants more than $1 billion collectively to repair their properties damaged by the storm and raise their homes to reduce the risk of future flood damage, and set a December 2019 deadline to close out the program.Many families slowed by what they described as permitting issues, contractor disputes and trouble navigating \"changing and confusing program rules\" have yet to complete their projects.\"It's like, 'Okay, we are going to give you this money and you are going to do this,'\" said Sharon Shohet, another program recipient in East Rockaway. \"You don't realize it's going to be such a problem until all these years into it, and everything became a problem.\"Now with coronavirus, those same families scrambling to respond to the state's letter and schedule inspections before the end of March, received another letter informing them that \"in-person inspections have been temporarily deferred.\"\"I cried and then I laughed,\" Shohet said. \"It's like you have to be kidding me.\"Both Shohet and Goldstone said they worried, would the state really take back funds that had been promised to them because of construction issues and other uncontrollable delays they experienced?\"NY Rising needs to step up and finish what they started here,\" Goldstone said. \"We are all going to end up homeless.\"7 On Your Side Investigates reached out to the Governor's Office of Storm Recovery, the state agency in charge of NY Rising.\"Through the NY Rising Housing Recovery Program, GOSR remains committed to assisting as many homeowners as possible to successfully complete their recovery and resiliency projects- allowing them to join the 10,000 New Yorkers who have already utilized State funding to complete their required repairs. By providing individualized case management and recognizing that there is no 'one-size-fits-all' approach to recovery, GOSR continues to help as many applicants as possible to cross the finish line, understanding that more resilient housing stock makes all of our communities stronger, smarter and better prepared,\" wrote Thehbia Hiwot, GOSR Executive Director of Housing, Buyouts and Acquisition, in a statement.A GOSR spokesperson also clarified, due to COVID-19, homeowners would not be penalized for scheduling inspections after March 13.She said only applicants who received funds for work which is not feasible to complete or which they opt not to complete will be asked to return recovery dollars.Applicants required to return unused or misused funds would be offered a monthly, no interest payment plan, according to the spokesperson, after exhausting an appeals process available to them.It's some reassurance but little consolation for people like Shohet and Goldstone who say they need more help from the state navigating the challenges of a complicated home makeover if they are going to get the job done.\"It has been nothing but an uphill battle for over seven years,\" Goldstone said. \"I have no more tears.

Some of the startups have already raised money, giving them a longer runway and, hence, they can keep the boat steady even though economic activity is shut for some time, an industry player said.  \"They can still survive. Some of them are making efforts to reduce the cost by cutting down salaries, or non-essentials cost.

Another startup entrepreneur said it all depends on how long the lockdown continues and, if it gets lifted by April- end, they will slowly come back to normal and they can raise money if they want.

Otherwise, some of the good startups may not be able to survive if the lockdown continues for long, cautioned Balakrishnan.  The Indian startups require liquidity in the short-term because they have to keep the operations running, he said.  \"Because of no economic activity, cash flow is getting impacted so either they (the government) should give lockdown financing at very minimal interest rate,\" he said.

Even in those counties, some individual judges still required lawyers to come to court in person for matters as simple as scheduling a future hearing. The WACDL letter said one judge, which it did not name, responded to a lawyer's concerns that COVID-19 \"is no worse than the flu\" and insisted lawyers come to court in person.  In Michigan, Chief Justice Bridget M.

(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill)  WASHINGTON (AP) — A clinical trial evaluating a vaccine designed to protect against the new coronavirus will begin Monday, according to a government official.  The first participant in the trial will receive the experimental vaccine on Monday, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the trial has not been publicly announced yet. The National Institutes of Health is funding the trial, which is taking place at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle, the official said.  Public health officials say it will take a year to 18 months to fully validate any potential vaccine.  Testing will begin with 45 young, healthy volunteers with different doses of shots co-developed by NIH and Moderna Inc. There’s no chance participants could get infected from the shots, because they don’t contain the virus itself. The goal is purely to check that the vaccines show no worrisome side effects, setting the stage for larger tests.  Dozens of research groups around the world are racing to create a vaccine as COVID-19 cases continue to grow. Importantly, they’re pursuing different types of vaccines — shots developed from new technologies that not only are faster to produce than traditional inoculations but might prove more potent. Some researchers even aim for temporary vaccines, such as shots that might guard people’s health a month or two at a time while longer-lasting protection is developed.  Differing symptoms between cold, flu and coronavirus  For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The worldwide outbreak has sickened more than 156,000 people and left more than 5,800 dead. The death toll in the United States is more than 50, while infections neared 3,000 across 49 states and the District of Columbia.  CDC recommends keeping gatherings to less than 50 people for the next 2 months  The vast majority of people recover. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three weeks to six weeks to recover.

People should use masks and the establishments should provide sanitisers and hand wash facilities,\" the chief minister said.  He also said that industrial sector can function with 50 per cent of staff and should implement \"shifts\" for the staff.  Vijayan added that the companies must either provide accommodation for the staff or transportation facilities.  The state government has also decided to restart the construction sector with stringent conditions including health precautions including social distancing.  \"Those offices and establishments which will reopen after the lockdown period requires to be disinfected before functioning and the locality must also be cleaned.  The local self government institutions can make use of the guest workers who are presently jobless for the Haritha Karma Sena functions,\" Vijayan said.  \"From April 20, the state government proposes to implement the odd-even number scheme for vehicles to ply in the state.  But there will some relaxation in the case of women-driven vehicles,\" Vijayan said.  He also asked those who recovered from COVID-19, to remain quarantined at home for 14 days.  Meanwhile, the Kerala Police on Thursday registered 2,941 cases, arresting 2,863 people and 2,048 vehicles for violating lockdown norms.

Legal immigrants and illegal migrants are part of the city’s one million population who are “too often ignored, underpaid, and overworked … [and] very often lack healthcare, have to travel long distances to get to work, and struggle with childcare,” said Stringer’s March 26 report.  But Stringer’s plea for a taxpayer bailout of city’s cheap labor economy ignores the reality that Americans are impoverished by the elite’s support for mass migration, said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies.  The report cites impoverished “Nurses, janitors, grocery clerks, childcare staff, bus and truck drivers … those in our social service, cleaning, delivery and warehouse, grocery, healthcare, and public transit industries.”  “Back in the day when these workers were Americans and unionized, they were making more than a living wage,” she said. Before elites encouraged millions of legal and illegal migrants to flood Americans’ workplaces, she said:  People raised their families on those jobs — they were good jobs … They were jobs that people were glad to have, where they could support their families [and homes] on them. They had [medical] benefits. If that was still the system …. they would have good healthcare plans, and they would have sick leave.  Stringer is asking for “taxpayers to subsidize the city’s cheap labor economy,” and to preserve the city’s policy of “corporate welfare through illegal immigration,” Vaughan said.  The disguised plea for the illegal immigration bailout is spotlighted by Stringer’s back-handed admission that “many in New York City are also undocumented, meaning they do all of the above while living in fear of deportation under the current federal administration.”  Stringer’s report touts the city’s high poverty levels, noting that 34 percent of “all frontline workers” are at or below the poverty line. — including roughly 35 percent of rail clerks and 39 percent cleaning workers.  The report shows that 35 percent of cleaning workers and 27 percent of retail workers are either legal immigrants or illegal migrants:  This high-immigration low-wage economic policy is back by business groups that get more consumers, more renters, and more cheap workers. For example, Stringer’s report was touted in a tweet shared by Todd Schulte, the director of FWD.us, an advocacy group that was formed by wealthy West Coast investors:  .@NYCComptroller new study found 19% of “frontline workers” are non-citizens, “often placing them in a precarious and frightening position in this age of arbitrary ICE crackdowns.” #COVID19 #NewYorkUnited https://t.co/8swfUJhCMl — Eddie (@EddieATaveras) March 27, 2020  Stringer did not ask for an immigration reform that would create a tight labor market where Americans workers could bargain on equal terms with their employers.  Instead, Stringer asked for a series of narrow government programs that would ensure that Democrat city officials can claim credit for the taxpayer aid:  The City and State should help provide free protective equipment and gear—including gloves, masks, and hand sanitizer—to all businesses … The City and State should subsidize [coronavirus] hazard pay for small businesses in order to properly compensate workers and help recruit new employees in these high-risk and currently understaffed industries … The State and City should ensure access to free healthcare for all direct service workers in “essential industries”—either via Medicaid or otherwise … the State must expand its unemployment, healthcare, and other safety net programs to cover independent contractors … bus service should be preserved while regular off-peak schedules should be maintained on the subway and commuter rail … For the remainder of the COVID-19 crisis, Metro-North and LIRR should charge a $2.75 fare for any and all trips into New York City … the City should offer a subsidy to any frontline worker who is interested in purchasing a bike or e-bike … Free and Easily Accessible Child Care for all Frontline Workers.  Stringer’s report also wants city officials to recruit migrants to vote for Democrat politicians:  Over half of frontline workers are foreign-born and nearly one-quarter are non-citizens … the City of New York must bolster pathways to citizenship and enable non-citizen voting in all municipal elections … It is only fair that those who pay taxes and provide essential frontline services to all New Yorkers should have a direct say in municipal affairs.  New York City’s leaders “have institutionalized the use of illegal workers, and made them a fixture of the workforce in New York,” responded Vaughan.  When this is exposed in an economic crisis, they want taxpayers and the government to bail them out with amnesty policies and cash assistance to these workers that they encouraged to settle there, while paying them substandard wages … The bill is coming due for the cheap labor policies that they encouraged [the city’s] employers to adopt.

Omar Carrera of Canal Alliance pointed it out in a recent Marin Voice (“Let COVID-19 be the reason we attack long-standing inequities,” April 21). Here’s the shameful truth: just like climate change, COVID-19 impacts low-income communities of color to a far greater extent than their percentage of the population.  Insufficient affordable housing and consequent crowding, unhealthful environmental conditions like pollution and flooding, low wages, inadequate access to health care, healthy food and civic institutions all collide to make these Marin residents particularly susceptible to the worst outcomes in a crisis.  A recent IJ front page highlighted the ways that the pandemic has worsened financial strain in Marin City. Here we highlight an additional challenge for immigrant communities such as San Rafael’s Canal neighborhood: immigration and documentation status.  The “public charge” rule makes many people reluctant to be noticed, fearful that accessing health care services or assistance of any kind will jeopardize their chances of obtaining or keeping a green card, or even lead to deportation.  According to a KCBS radio report, perhaps as many as 90% of Canal residents are now unemployed, laid off, or have lost their daywork. Their immigration status will dictate whether they can receive unemployment compensation or stimulus payments.  Most of the Canal residents who are currently working have to risk their own and their family’s health performing low-wage “essential” jobs — food service and grocery, essential repair and maintenance, caregiving or delivery service — just to put food on the table. Many live from paycheck to paycheck without savings, and struggle to meet basic needs.  We are all struggling in different ways under the weight of this unprecedented pandemic. Let us remember that many of the essential services we rely on today, such as food, are made possible by a local workforce that is teetering on the precipice of hunger and homelessness.  Marin’s safety net is strong, but cannot reach everywhere. In the face of this, a broad governmental and nonprofit effort has arisen.  Marin County government, the Marin Community Foundation, Marin Health and Human Services and Marin Community Clinics, as well as private foundations and donors, have stepped up.  Two Canal-based nonprofits, the Canal Alliance and Multicultural Center of Marin, are coordinating to provide staff for food distribution sites, deliver food to those who are homebound, offer legal services and provide information and resources. Modest cash assistance is being provided to desperate families in need of groceries.  These are appropriate and, ultimately, inadequate responses to the current crisis.  While Marin County’s COVID-19 eviction moratorium will temporarily protect some tenants unable to pay their rent from homelessness, back rent still accrues. If Canal residents are unemployed and have no savings, the eviction moratorium merely delays their homelessness.  There’s a compassionate as well as economically sound response: if you own property and you are able, you could reduce rents during this time and allow a workable payback period after restrictions are lifted and people can go back to work.  COVID-19 has magnified many of the underlying inequities in our local economy and society. Getting “back to normal” is not enough. We must “build back better.”  With thoughtful policy, leadership, political will — which might include tenant organizing and rent control — and the better angels of our nature, we can remake our civil society to begin to redress the fundamental disparities in health and wealth this virus time has laid bare.  In addition to responding to the immediate crisis, the Marin Environmental Housing Collaborative will continue to work with our partners, such as the Multicultural Center of Marin, to research policies and best practices.  MEHC will advocate for adequate affordable housing, environmental protection and mitigation, and pursue equity in opportunities and economic security for all Marinites.

Correa and his vice president, Jorge Glas, were given eight-year sentences for corruption and bribery, and barred from politics for 25 years on Tuesday in the culmination of what Correa and his supporters have long framed as a politically-motivated setup.  The leftist former leader, who decamped for Belgium in 2017 after realizing his hand-picked successor, current president Lenin Moreno, was not the devout democratic socialist he had played on the campaign trail, expressed worry for his colleagues but otherwise seemed unconcerned. “This is what they were looking for: managing justice to achieve what they could never do at the ballot box,” Correa tweeted following the decision. “Surely we win internationally, because everything is bulls**t, but it takes years.”  It depends on your vote that this nightmare ends.  Also on rt.com Ecuador’s Covid-19 catastrophe is man-made disaster — because for political elites ordinary Ecuadorians are just disposables  Moreno, elected with a mandate to carry on Correa’s leftist “Citizens’ Revolution,” reneged on his campaign promises almost immediately and began making nice with the US and the International Monetary Fund, reversing his predecessor’s hard-won gains and setting the stage for the nation’s current health crisis.  His government has been trying to pin charges on Correa for years, ordering him in 2018 to return to Ecuador to stand trial for the 2012 botched kidnapping of an opposition lawmaker – a request Interpol vetoed as “obviously a political matter.” When massive protests broke out in October across the country against a round of punishing austerity measures, Moreno accused the expat ex-president of colluding with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to overthrow his government – a notion Correa found laughable.  “They say I am so powerful that with an iPhone from Brussels I could lead the protests,” he told Reuters at the time.  The current case of “aggravated passive bribery” centers on a $7 million corruption scheme in which Correa’s political party allegedly took payments from corporations in exchange for bestowing generous government contracts. Of the 20 individuals accused in the case, 18 were found guilty.  Also on rt.com Bodies of Covid-19 victims pile up in streets of Ecuador as residents beg authorities for help  Some might call the conviction a distraction from the macabre scenes currently playing out in the streets of Guayaquil, however. With 90 percent of Ecuador’s coronavirus cases, the city has proven utterly unable to handle the crisis; Moreno, channeling his American counterpart, dismissed the burning bodies in the streets as “fake news with clear political intent” earlier this month. The country has reported a mere 191 deaths and 3,747 confirmed cases as of Tuesday, even as its health minister acknowledged earlier this month that 1,500 had died in Guayaquil alone. Healthcare cuts effected by the Moreno government took annual spending from $306 million in 2017 to a mere $110 million in 2019, a matter which surely hasn’t helped the national response to the crisis.

And the fact that former Nintendo staffers Perrin Kaplan, Beth Llewelyn and Scott Tsumura are on-board only increases that.  Aimed at families who want accessible games at a low cost (software will be priced between $2.99 and $7.99, while the console itself is expected to retail for between $149 and $179), the Amico has our attention – even more so when you consider it's going to be the only place you can play the upcoming Earthworm Jim sequel. However, having watched a 'sizzle' reel of 23 different Amico games, we can't help but feel a little bit nervous about the console's chances of finding the audience it needs to become a success.  While some of the titles shown are marked as still being early in development, many of them look like they've stepped right out of the iOS App Store form a decade ago. There are some interesting concepts which use the Amico's unique controllers and the ability to record audio, but on the whole, we're looking at gameplay designs from the '80s and '90s which have been 'tarted up' with some pretty underwhelming 3D visuals.  Subscribe to Nintendo Life on  Given that each game is looking to sell for a super-low price, the budget feel of these titles is perhaps understandable – but for this model to work, the Amico is going to have to sell millions to make it attractive to quality developers who can afford to sell their titles at a low cost. It works on smartphones and consoles like the Switch because there are already millions of potential buyers out there – the Amico isn't going to benefit from that kind of audience, at least not in the short-term.  Still, if you're still willing to give this system a shot then pre-orders for the VIP edition of the machine – which starts at $249 – open on March 21st, with the Amico expected to launch on 10th October 2020. Whether or not the recent coronavirus outbreak will impact that remains to be seen, of course.  Tommy Tallarico, Intellivision CEO and Amico creator, had this to say about the announcement of the VIP edition:  Our supporters worldwide shared our excitement when we made our first 2,600 Founders Edition units available, and we received an overwhelming demand for another opportunity to participate after we sold out. Given the potential impact on manufacturing due to COVID-19, we understand it may be difficult to find entertainment products later this year and we want to give our most loyal followers an invitation to own their very own Amico.

Share Shares Copy Link Copy  President Donald Trump said Sunday he would invoke the Defense Production Act to compel an American company to make more swabs for COVID-19 testing.\"We've ordered a lot of them. They have a lot of them,\" Trump said during a White House press briefing.But a bipartisan chorus of governors — including Maryland's Larry Hogan, a Republican, and Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat — say they face a shortage of swabs and reagents to test for the novel coronavirus.Mark Albert asked a panel of doctors from both ends of the country: Dr. Stephen Blatt, an infectious diseases physician with Cincinatti-based TriHealth; and Dr. Claudette Rodriguez of HonorHealth in Arizona. Both were asked where the U.S. stands with swab testing.\"We could certainly use more testing,\" Blatt said, \"and that will be the way that we will control this outbreak going forward. There was a shortage of the swabs to do the tests. There was a shortage of test kits.\"Trump promises 20 million swabs are coming, but his first FDA commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, said the U.S. is not likely to have widespread COVID-19 testing nationwide anytime soon. \"Hopefully we'll be there by September,\" Gottlieb said.More testing is easier said than done, but it is something many physicians, Rodriguez included, think is vital to limiting the spread of the disease.\"We should ramp up our ability to test,\" Rodriguez said. \"I think we need to know who has the disease or who had it and is now immune.

PHOENIX — Arizonans hoping to avoid contracting COVID-19 won’t be able to get their hands on an experimental drug, at least not legally here in the state.  In an executive order Thursday, April 2, Gov. Doug Ducey restricted pharmacists from dispensing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine unless they have a prescription from a doctor saying the patient actually has the virus.  And even in that case, the governor limited the prescription to no more than a 14-day supply, with no refills without a new prescription.  The order follows the publication earlier this week of small study by a group of Chinese doctors, which showed patients who received hydroxychloroquine, a known anti-malaria drug, had more rapid recovery of body temperature and reduced coughing than those in the control group who did not get the drug. There also was a larger proportion of patients with improved pneumonia in the group that got the drug.  But public interest in hydroxychloroquine and its closely related chloroquine predates that, coming after President Donald Trump last month mentioned them in a White House briefing. Both are currently used largely to treat malaria.  “I’m a smart guy,” the president said. “I feel good about it. And we’re going to see. You’re going to see soon enough.”  That, in turn, has created a spike in demand, resulting in shortages for patients who use the drugs not only for malaria but autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.  Ducey’s restriction on dispensing of the drugs came as part of a larger executive order dealing with access to other prescription medications.  For many, the most significant part of that is a directive to the state Board of Pharmacy to allow druggists to “utilize their professional judgment” to dispense emergency refills of maintenance medications for up to a 90-day supply without getting a written prescription. The order also permits an additional 90-day supply “if necessary.”  That order does not cover various narcotics such as oxycodone, codenie and fentanyl. But it does waive the rules that now require a written prescription, allowing a doctor to fax, scan or send a photo of the prescription.  There’s also a provision that could be a boon for availability - and potentially price - allowing pharmacies to receive drugs from an unpermitted manufacturer in another country “to alleviate pharmaceutical shortages.”  “Given the enhanced demand on our hospitals and our medical providers, we want to make sure that Arizonans have all the access to the medications that they need,” said gubernatorial press aide Patrick Ptak. He said the move to allow importation is not unique, saying it already is allowed by several other states “and is considered best practice for times like this.”  The restrictions on who can get hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine fall into the same category, according to Trisa Guzman Glover, the governor’s director of boards and commissions.  “It is limited to the diagnosis or the suspected positive for COVID-19 so that we’re not running into shortages for those individuals who are taking it for other reasons,” she told Capitol Media Services.  This isn’t just an Arizona problem given the publicity the drugs were given not only by Trump but also some much earlier reports of studies out of France and China, studies that some scientists are questioning because they did not have a control group for comparison.  “Nationwide there are shortages with this medication,” Glover said. “And I think those are affecting Arizona as well.”  The latest Chinese study has its own limits.  Starting with 142 patients with confirmed COVID-19 patients, it was whittled down to 62 after eliminating severe and critical illness patients, those with various other diseases including severe renal failure, and those who had received any trial treatment for COVID-19 within 30 days.  What was left were those for whom a CT scan showed pneumonia but those with what was described as a “mild illness.”  “Despite our small number of cases, the potential of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 has been partially confirmed,” the authors said.  They acknowledged the need for large-scale clinical and basic research. But they said that should not stop doctors from using the drug.  “Considering that there is no better option at present, it is a promising practice to apply HCQ to COVID-19 under reasonable management,” the paper states.

(KTAL/KMSS) – Keep Louisiana Beautiful has launched a new statewide campaign that is different from past years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  What was originally going to be ‘Love the Boot Week’ is now ‘Love the Boot At Home.’  “Which was going to be a week-long of activities around earth day, to engage citizens and businesses, schools, local and state governments to get out to clean and beautify your piece of the world,” said Keep Louisiana Beautiful Executive Director Susan Russell.  Russel said they’ve had to cancel more than 100 planned events in 40 parishes because of the pandemic, but they’re making the most of the situation.  “Right now everybody is being told all the things they can’t do and so we decided that this was an opportunity to Keep Louisiana Beautiful to offer some ideas and thoughts and hope, things that they can do,” said Russell.  And instead of going out into the community and participating in Love the Boot Week, you can do it at home using 21 tips on what families and individuals can do while practicing social distancing.  Those 21 tips are environmental activities for families to clean up around their homes and their neighborhoods. They are even giving parents a way to keep kids busy with educational projects.  “11 lessons with hands-on activities, and worksheets, everything from learning how to compost to teaching your children how to watershed and the important role that plays in Louisiana,” Russell said.

Democratic Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, along with four other Democratic congressmen, delivered a letter Monday to acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, requesting the administration take action to protect the immigrant community and detained illegal aliens from COVID-19.  Among their demands: a “moratorium” on all immigration arrests of individuals who pose no public safety risk, a release of as “many immigrants as possible” from detention, and a reconsideration of the Trump administration’s public charge rules.  “In times of a public health crisis, it is imperative that we protect the most vulnerable and remove barriers to care for all, including fears of enforcement that prevent immigrant communities from seeking care,” the progressive lawmakers wrote.  “COVID-19 does not discriminate based on nationality, citizenship status, or any other characteristic, and our federal agencies must respond accordingly,” the letter continued.  Jayapal and the other Democratic lawmakers said the large-scale release of aliens in DHS detention — those in Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody — was necessary to decrease the population of “overcrowded” facilities. (RELATED: ‘Not At This Time’: DHS Chief Chad Wolf Says No Plan For Nationwide Lockdown)  Notably, some of these concerns posed in the letter have already been addressed by DHS officials.  ICE announced Wednesday that the agency would scale back its enforcement procedures, focusing on individuals who pose public safety risks and those subject to mandatory detention. Additionally, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, another agency within DHS, announced earlier in March that illegal aliens could seek COVID-19 testing without fear of being penalized under the public charge rule.  USCIS has implored the immigrant community to get tested if they are showing symptoms of coronavirus.  The letter was joined by Democratic Reps. Joaquin Castro and Veronica Escobar of Texas, Chuy Garcia of Illinois, and Adam Smith of Washington state.  A separate groups of Democratic lawmakers — led by Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar — sent a letter to DHS on Friday, demanding a total freeze on deportations.

Using mobile location data in the coronavirus fight comes amid intense scrutiny of the privacy practices of tech companies, which collect detailed information about people's interests on apps and websites, often to target ads.  Facebook and the researchers leading the project say they have overcome those concerns by aggregating the data several times over and funnelling it through academics. The researchers share broad findings with state and local health departments, which do not receive any raw data.  Facebook confirmed it was sharing the data as part of its nearly year-old Disease Prevention Maps programme, which has also aided efforts to increase vaccination rates in Malawi and track cholera outbreaks in Mozambique.  Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told reporters last month that he would not consider sharing Facebook's data directly with governments.  The Mobility Data Network has become one of the first initiatives to harness mobile data for the US response to the coronavirus pandemic, an approach deployed early in places like China, South Korea and much of Europe but scarcely used so far in the United States.  With the virus already spread widely throughout the country, the research focuses on the success of measures designed to get people to stay home, as almost 40 US states have ordered.  Using the data, which is stripped of identifying information, researchers provide insights like the average distance of trips users have taken in a city and the proportion of residents in each county that have stayed within their 600 square meter home \"tiles.\"  In New York, for example, researchers found mobility dropped significantly on the weekends but crept back up on weekdays, when many people - particularly those living in low-income neighbourhoods - are still required to work.  The data can also show \"if at first people stop moving but then begin to travel further once fatigue sets in,\" said Caroline Buckee, an epidemiologist at Harvard's School of Public Health who is among those leading the network.  Measuring changes in mobility and correlating them with later hospitalizations can also eventually help determine how to roll back social distancing orders, said Buckee, who previously studied the spread of malaria and dengue using mobile data.   GRABBING LOCATION DATA  About half of the apps on Alphabet Inc's Google's Play Store and a quarter on Apple Inc's App Store use at least one service capable of grabbing location data, according to industry research firm Appfigures.  Smaller location tracking services including Cuebiq and Camber Systems are queued up to provide inputs to the research network, too.  Others in talks to receive location analyses include Maryland, Washington and the District of Columbia, along with Los Angeles, San Jose, Santa Clara and Kansas City.  Kansas City confirmed that it was considering taking part in the project, while the other government agencies did not respond to requests for comment.  Facebook is in touch with the White House and Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, a spokeswoman said, but added that no analyses have been delivered to any US federal entities so far.  Another coronavirus data initiative, the Data and Research Technology Task Force, is liaising with Vice President Mike Pence's coronavirus task force and includes employees from Alphabet Inc's Google, Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com Inc, said Josh Mendelsohn, who worked on disaster aid programs at Google a decade ago.  The companies did not respond to requests for comment.  Although other countries have successfully used location data to warn contacts of those with infections, neither officials nor researchers in the United States have asked for such personal information, said Mendelsohn.  \"Contact tracing is something that we were beyond weeks ago,\" said Mendelsohn. \"They need something that shows how we are doing vis-a-vis social distancing, which statistically models what we are about to be in for, so as to predict patient load.\"  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 15, "positive": 16, "negative": 5, "disgust": 2, "joy": 1, "anger": 7, "fear": 1, "trust": 6}, "metadata": ["researchers", "media", "massachusetts", "coronavirus", "facebook", "deployed", "korea", "united", "virus", "significantly", "epidemiologist", "distancing", "app", "tracking", "washington", "district", "los", "san", "santa", "kansas", "microsoft", "google", "warn", "tracing", "models"]}, {"text": "NEW ALBANY, Ind. — Officials from One Southern Indiana (1si), the chamber of commerce and economic development organization for Clark and Floyd counties, Ind., the Community Foundation of Southern Indiana (CFSI) and the Caesars Foundation of Floyd County (CFFC) announced Wednesday the initial $360,000 raised to assist businesses adversely affected by the coronavirus pandemic has been awarded.  The fund, named the COVID-19 Small Business Emergency Forgivable Loan Program, provided forgivable loans of up to $10,000 each to 37 businesses in Clark and Floyd counties.  Of the initial $360,000 raised, $214,000 was earmarked by the donors to be applied to businesses within a specific municipality or county. The remaining $146,000 was designated to be split evenly among businesses within Clark and Floyd counites.  In Clarksville, S&R Towing & Recovery, LLC, received a $10,000 loan. Owner Bobby Raggard said, “With the help of this loan, our small business will stay afloat amid these uncertain times. The rapid response and quick action of the Caesar’s Foundation was astounding! Thank you for helping our family-owned company stay in business to meet the needs of our local communities!” Other Clarksville businesses set to receive loans are 2 Guys and a Pickup LLC, SK3, LLC (S.K. Sign and Banner) and the Southern Indiana Tennis Center.  Donum Dei Brewery was the recipient of a $10,000 loan from a fund designated for use by businesses located in New Albany or Floyd County. Owner Richard Otey commented, “Donum Dei Brewery would like to thank Jerry Finn and the Caesars Foundation, One Southern Indiana and all of the other organizations that contributed to the COVID-19 Small Business Emergency Forgivable Loan Program. This loan will allow us to stay open and maintain our staffing at current levels. It will also give us the opportunity to replenish our raw materials that have been depleted by making hand sanitizer for the community.” JM Ways LLC (Skyline Chili), Kentuckiana Music Center, Periago Orthodontics LLC, and Rainbow Dance Academy also received funding from this source.  In New Albany, Bobby Bass, owner of MESA – A Collective Kitchen, and also a loan recipient, told us, “Our MESA concept has suffered greatly and with all revenue, literally stopping… this helps us tremendously. Out of all the potential assistance, Caesar’s and 1si offered our first and quickest line of help for us. We couldn’t be more grateful to have a partner like Caesar’s and 1si in the marketplace.” Additional funding in New Albany was also awarded to Copier Mart, Honest & Fair Appliance Repair, SIGS Sportsplex and Stumler’s Catering  Terri Lyn Doyle, owner of Terri Lynn’s Catering in Floyd County was a recipient and said, “It means so much to have organizations like yours who can step up and help. I only hope that six or eight months from now I can be back on my feet and in a position to help others. The livelihoods of all my employees and their families rely on the success of Terri Lynn’s Catering. This loan will help ease all of our minds! Bless all of you! Thanks for your hard work during the terrible crisis!” Also receiving funding from this designated fund was Starlight Coffee, House of K Boutique, The Purple Pearl and Summers of New Albany.  Established in 1993, Mark Fraley Produce, Inc., which was granted a loan, has become a staple of the Sellersburg community. President of the company, Caroline Miller, said, “We at Mark Fraley Produce, Inc. would like to express our sincere appreciation and are so very thankful for your community support in helping those in need. These funds will assist our company in purchasing fresh produce to stock our inventory and assure our staff that we can fully continue to serve our loyal and deserving customers in this local area.” Genesis One Enterprise, Inc., (Genesis Home loans) and Rubbin’ Butts BBQ LLC, also received funding in Sellersburg.  With the undesignated funds, seven business from each county received loans from the program. In Clark County, companies receiving assistance were: Brinegar Family Dentistry, Blitz Manufacturing, Hyperion Ventures, Sounds Unlimited Productions, Todaro Ventures LLC (American Smokehouse Stadium), Tranzformationz Salon and VIP Awards and Gifts.  Dr. Daniel Brinegar said, “Brinegar Family Dentistry is a small private-practice dental office located in Jeffersonville, Indiana and we are incredibly thankful for the support of the Caesar’s Foundation and One Southern Indiana in making the COVID-19 Small Business Emergency Forgivable Loan Program available to local businesses. Although it was an economically painful decision, we have done our best to help ‘flatten the curve’ and ‘do our part’ during this pandemic. We have essentially closed the business to everything except absolutely necessary care. This forgivable loan will help make sure Brinegar Family Dentistry is still in business, fully staffed, and stocked when it is safe to return to patient care again.“  The seven Floyd County businesses granted loans were Bliss Travel, Clucker’s New Albany, Dehoney Travel, Inc., Kelly Dental Laboratory, Madhouse, The Stained Glass Gallery, LLC, and Track Days Turning LLC. Matt Murley, one of the four owners of Clucker’s New Albany, thanked the program donors, saying, “The entire Cluckers’ team would like to thank everyone who had a helping hand in making the COVID-19 Small Business Emergency Loan Program possible during this devastating time. COVID-19 has had a major negative impact on all families throughout our local community and the world. It’s times like these when everyone must work together and help one another to get through!”  A limited amount of funding remains for businesses located in Clark County outside of incorporated areas. At this time, Huber’s Family Farm and Restaurant is the only business that has taken advantage of the program in this designated area.  Going forward, municipalities, private foundations, organizations and citizens interested in providing much-needed direct assistance to local small businesses are invited to contribute to the COVID-19 Small Business Emergency Forgivable Loan Program through the Community Foundation of Southern Indiana. Contributions may be made at the CFSI website, https://www.cfsouthernindiana.com/giving-planning/give-today/. Donors simply work through the steps and choose “Small Business” as their giving choice. If desired, donations may be designated for businesses in specific counties or municipalities.  President and CEO of 1si Wendy Dant Chesser commented, “We approached this endeavor from a ‘triage’ perspective. Everyone involved agreed the goal was to get as much funding out to our businesses in need as quickly as possible. Needless to say, we were overwhelmed by need and had to turn many worthy businesses away in the end. I think I speak for the whole business community when I say it is our hope funding will be made available for a second round of loans. ”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 16, "positive": 40, "negative": 11, "disgust": 2, "joy": 8, "anger": 6, "surprise": 2, "fear": 9, "trust": 8}, "metadata": ["economic", "coronavirus", "pandemic", "designated", "funding", "families", "matt", "ceo"]}, {"text": " india  Updated: Apr 24, 2020, 16:23 IST  While Human Resources Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank is busy encouraging online education so that academics of students doesn’t suffer during the ongoing lockdown, his daughter Aarushi is coordinating a voluntary face mask making drive.

Citing difficulty in the procurement of raw clothing material, Rita said that if the government or local administration provides some relaxation in this aspect, their women volunteers can double up the facemask production.  Mahakumbh Mela police force in charge, Janmejay Khanduri, who was recently handed over a thousand face masks by these women activists, lauded their concern saying, “This motivates every personnel involved in anti-Covid operations directly or indirectly.”  Patanjali Yogpeeth general secretary, Acharya Balkrishan has also lauded the self volunteerism shown by Sparsh Ganga women activists assuring of cooperation to them in making face masks on a mass scale as soon as waivers are granted from the state government.  “Fight against Covid-19 is long so we need to wear face masks on a routine basis.

His proposal went on to state that “the link between climate change and health security is well-documented and will create a growing threat to Americans.”  The assessment that man-made global warming will lead to massive increases in mortality isn’t just stated by “Joe the walking gaffe machine,” but is asserted as fact by most agencies and groups that promote the so-called “consensus” opinion on catastrophic man-made global warming. The reliably unreliable U. S. National Climate Assessment stated that “heat is already the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the United States.”  Climate extremists, like those that created the National Climate Assessment, predict that heat waves and high temperatures related to global warming will kill increasingly more people worldwide. As usual, the inconvenient facts are otherwise. If the merchants of doom were right, the warming over the last 150 years should be reflected in more heat-related deaths.  The inconvenient fact is that cold kills considerably more people than heat. It is, by far, the biggest weather-related killer worldwide. Warmer weather would mean far fewer premature temperature-related deaths.  A study of temperature-associated mortality found that cold-related deaths in the U.K. and Australia accounted for 61 and 33 deaths per million, respectively, while heat-related deaths were only three and two per million. Cold kills more than 15 times as many people as heat in these countries.  In the largest study to date on deaths attributable to heat or cold, Gasparrini (2015) and a large team of collaborators from around the world examined more than 74 million deaths in 13 countries between 1985 and 2012. Warm countries included Thailand and Brazil; temperate countries included Australia; cold countries included Sweden. The aim was to determine the number of deaths attributable to either heat or cold.  The study revealed that cold weather kills 20 times as many people as heat. Worse, one in 15 deaths, from all causes, was attributable to cold. Only one death in 250 was attributable to heat. In every country examined, cold-related deaths greatly outnumbered deaths from heat.  By far the largest number of temperature-related deaths comes from moderate cold. Of course, moderate cold occurs far more frequently than extreme cold: but these figures show, and show clearly, that even a modest decrease in temperature is more likely to kill, while even a large increase is not.  According to research into summer heat-related deaths in the United States, these deaths declined dramatically in the last half of the 20th century and continue to fall. Between 1979 and 2006, United States annual death rates from heat declined by 10%, while deaths from cold fell by a dramatic 37%. In fact, extreme-weather deaths and death rates have decreased by 98% since the 1920s, notwithstanding the modest global warming since then.  The statistics tell us that temperature-related deaths are decreasing around the world and that the decline in cold-linked mortality is particularly dramatic. And that -- except in the world of climate extremism -- is a very good thing.  The facts starkly challenge the contention that warmer weather kills. The truth is that warmer weather has already cut temperature-related deaths, and will continue to do so, directly raising life expectancies around the world. The facts and the data demonstrate exactly the opposite of what the prognosticators of climate doom predict. If this important element of the alarmist campaign is so easily debunked by so many scientific studies, shouldn’t one also look with a critical eye at all the other hobgoblins of alarm?  At this point in time we don’t know how badly humanity will be impacted by the COVID-19 virus, but a recent study gives some hope for a savior in warming weather as winter gives way to spring and summer. According to the report, the family of coronaviruses “have been shown to display strong winter seasonality between December and April and are undetectable in summer months in temperate regions.” We shall see if that holds true for our current contagion.

Gaines  Dozens of planned elections in Maryland ― with their potential to spread the new coronavirus ― could be postponed after an executive order from Gov. Larry Hogan was signed on Monday.  Hogan (R) issued an executive order allowing Maryland's 157 municipalities to suspend their charters to postpone elections or change from in-person voting if they provide notice to the governor.  About one-third of the state's municipalities are scheduled to hold elections before June. That includes seven communities scheduled to go to the ballot box within the next couple of weeks: Hebron, Henderson, Middletown, Oakmont, Port Tobacco, Queen Anne and Ridgely. Scott Hancock, chief executive of the Maryland Municipal League, said Monday evening that it was too soon to tell which municipalities might postpone or modify election plans.  \"There's been a lot of conversation within our association about whether they can move elections,\" Hancock said. \"Because they're worried that not a lot of people will come out and vote, and more importantly, that it would jeopardize the health and safety of the public.\" The executive order was issued to allow municipalities to avoid exposing government buildings, voters and municipal workers to the novel coronavirus.  \"Many municipal elections would ordinarily be conducted at polling locations that … hinder social distancing, enable the transmission of the novel coronavirus and pose risks to public health, welfare and safety,\" the order states.  The executive order will remain in effect until the state of emergency declared in Maryland on March 5 is lifted. As of Monday, there were at least 1,413 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state.  Thirty-eight municipalities had elections scheduled for May: Berwyn Heights, Boonsboro, Brookeville, Brookview, Cecilton, Chevy Chase, Chevy Chase Section 3, Chevy Chase View, Chevy Chase Village, Colmar Manor, Cottage City, Deer Park, Edmonston, Eldorado, Elkton, Funkstown, Garrett Park, Goldsboro, Havre de Grace, Keedysville, Laytonsville, Leonardtown, Midland, Morningside, New Carrollton, North Brentwood, North Chevy Chase, Perryville, Secretary, Smithsburg, Snow Hill, Somerset, St. Michaels, Sudlersville, University Park, Vienna, Washington Grove and Westernport.

I have a hypothesis on that, but it can wait — perhaps for another column, perhaps forever.  There’s no denying Kerala has done well, but so have Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Uttar Pradesh. I pick these three states and not other states that have done well (Karnataka, Haryana and Odisha, for instance) for one reason — all had something that went against them.  Delhi and Tamil Nadu, in that order, suffered the most from the irresponsibility of the Tablighi Jamaat, which insisted on hosting a weeks-long gathering at its headquarters in Delhi in March, a gathering that was attended by missionaries from some Covid-19-affected countries. And UP is, well, UP, the U in the late Ashish Bose’s coinage BIMARU, to refer to India’s most underdeveloped states in the 1980s, and also the most populous state in the country.  Delhi’s dashboard, on Wednesday night, showed 3,439 cases, 1,092 recoveries, and 56 deaths. The corresponding numbers for Tamil Nadu were 2,162, 1,210, and 27. And for UP – 2,134, 510, and 39. In terms of recoveries and deaths, all three states have done well. Kerala’s numbers on Wednesday (for an easy comparison) were 495 cases, 369 recoveries, and 3 deaths.  Sure, UP lags on the testing front — just around 360 per million population, according to the latest data — but Tamil Nadu (almost 1,500) and Delhi (almost 2,400) fare well on this count too. Tamil Nadu’s performance isn’t a surprise — for decades now, the state’s social development indicators have been among the best in the country. Nor is Delhi’s — it is the national capital, after all, and administered by a progressive government. UP is a surprise, a pleasant one, which merits deeper study. Its social development indicators remain in the red, and it is vast, in terms of geography as well as population. Yet it has managed to keep its Covid-19 numbers under control.  Delhi’s performance is at odds with how it has been treated by its neighbours. Both UP and Haryana are pushing for a hard border with the national capital, worried that people who live in UP and Haryana, and work in Delhi (there are many) or the other way round (there are perhaps as many) pose a risk. Local administrators, even ministers, have spoken of people who get infected in Delhi and carry it across the border.  Sure, these aren’t the only states to want hard borders with neighbours — in the past month, Karnataka has pushed for one with Kerala (the latter complained); Kerala then wanted one with Tamil Nadu (the latter complained); and Tamil Nadu wanted one with Andhra Pradesh (the latter complained). But Delhi’s situation is different.  It is different because Delhi is the epicentre of the National Capital Region which includes parts of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The urban and economic development seen in parts of these states bordering Delhi is simply because of that — proximity to the capital city-state. Gurugram is a city in its own right, but it is unlikely to have become the base for the India HQs of a few hundred Fortune 500 companies were it located deeper inside Haryana, say, near Sonipat (which too is part of NCR). The same is true for Noida, which is yet to graduate from being a Delhi-satellite, though that too should happen in a few years.  There are other urban agglomerations in India — the Mumbai Metropolitan Region which includes several satellite towns in Maharashtra is one — and for years now, governments have struggled with how to manage them. The latest episode involving Delhi, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh needs to be seen in that context. And, to the long list of personal, organisational, and governance improvements we need to focus on when this is all over, we can add one more — a better way to manage urban agglomerations across districts within the same state, and across several states.

All non-essential Australian Defence Force personnel are being withdrawn from Iraq and Afghanistan because of the coronavirus.  Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said all non-essential members would be moved back to Australia’s main logistical base in the Middle East temporarily, and some would be able to come back to Australia.  “This temporary measure is to preserve the safety of our people and partners, and to limit the spread of COVID-19 in operational areas,” Senator Reynolds said.  “There will be no impact to the force-protection of ADF personnel remaining in Iraq and Afghanistan.”  All operations were reviewed regularly with coalition partners, in consultation with Iraqi and Afghanistan governments, according to Senator Reynolds.  The spread of COVID-19 has also seen all training missions in the nations suspended.  It comes as Chief Medical Officer Professor Brendan Murphy says the government will soon stop testing people who contracted the virus to make sure it has been cleared from their system as it tries to preserve the few test kits available for potential new cases.  However, Australia has also started randomly testing people with general cold and flu symptoms for coronavirus to see if any cases of the deadly disease are being missed.  Prof Murphy said a number of GPs around Australia were already contracted by the government to randomly test patients with respiratory and flu symptoms to collect data about what viruses are in the community, and were now being asked to test for COVID-19.  “We have set up sentinel testing … sampling the community to pick up anyone with a flu-like illness and test them to see whether we are seeing undetected cases,” he said.  Chief Medical Officer Professor Brendan Murphy says the government will soon stop testing people who contracted the virus to make sure it has been cleared from their system. Picture: AAP  “That (group) of general practices that are testing every person who comes in – that will give us a read if we’re seeing examples of transmission that we haven’t seen.”  Prof Murphy said Australia had now conducted more than 135,000 COVID-19 tests and was “continually reviewing criteria” as the country would “need” to expand who qualifies for a test.  “We are expanding them already to look at aged care workers, healthcare workers, where there is a serious risk,” he said.  “We know that, in fact, the testing is done more liberally than the criteria at the moment … and in a way that’s good, because we still have a very low positivity rate – one of the lowest in the world.”  Prof Murphy said there were “good indications” Australia would have capacity to significantly expand testing.  He also urged Australians to follow quarantine advice if they had returned from overseas or had contact with a confirmed case, confirming there were plans underway to allow people to “dob in” a neighbour, friend or colleague if they did not comply with the rules.  “That is something we are looking at … I think it will be done at a state and territory level,” he said.  “Every single Australian who lands on our shore, whether it’s from a cruise ship or a plane, or any other means of transportation needs to rigorously quarantine for 14 days now.  “You are placing your fellow citizens at risk if you don’t.  “So, if you know of anyone who has come back from overseas and is not quarantining, please come down very hard on them.”  ADF HELPS TRACK CRUISE SHIP PASSENGERS  The Australian Defence Force is helping NSW health officials track down passengers of the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which could have been exposed to the coronavirus, after authorities let thousands of people disembark the infected ship last week.  In a statement, Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said “Contract Tracing Support Teams” were being established in all states and territories.  “A team of ADF personnel (has been) supporting NSW Health from yesterday,” she said.  There have been 48 confirmed cases of coronavirus among Ruby Princess passengers since they were allowed to disembark in Sydney on Thursday.  Cases linked to the ship have since emerged in Tasmania, WA and the Northern Territory.  Passengers have been urged to go into self-isolation for 14 days after authorities failed to test them for coronavirus when disembarking.  PROTECTIVE GEAR REACHES CRITICALLY LOW LEVELS  It comes as eighty Catholic hospitals which provide 10 per cent of the nation’s public hospital beds are running out of face masks, gloves, gowns and other protective gear with some having less than a week’s supply as COVID-19 stretches the system.  Catholic Health Australia is calling on the Morrison Government to urgently release stockpiles of personal protective equipment (PPE) to its hospital staff as stocks in its network reach critically low levels.  The Catholic network employs tens of thousands of nurses and clinical staff.  “Requests by Catholic hospitals to access stocks of gowns, masks and gloves have been met with confusion, buck passing between the states and the Commonwealth and even a diktat that supplies will be released only to publicly owned hospitals,” Catholic Health Australia CEO Pat Garcia said.  Almost one in ten public hospital beds are located in Catholic hospitals but because they are not directly owned by the state they are being denied access to the stockpiles, he said.  In some cases personal protective equipment stocks in Catholic hospitals would run out in as little as a week and Mr Garcia has written to state, territory and federal health ministers warning of the imminent shortfall.  A US doctor takes a sample from to test for coronavirus at a drive-through station in a Maryland’s hospital's parking. Picture: AFP  “We cannot have a situation where thousands of doctors and nurses are treating people unprotected – it’s a shocking situation for patients, staff and the wider community. We need every weapon in our arsenal to fight the coronavirus and masks, gowns and gloves are the very basics. It would be like sending in our fireys to fight fires without a truck.”  Mr Garcia said Catholic hospitals are running testing clinics, treating COVID-19 patients and ramping up the capacity in their wards and emergency departments to alleviate pressure on public hospitals.  “We are working with everyone in the wider health network to fight this virus. All we are asking for is the same access as the public network and for a clear and efficient way for our people to get hold of PPE supplies in a timely fashion.”  Dr Shane Kelly, Chief Executive of the St John of God group, which runs 17 hospitals in Western Australia, Victoria and NSW, said time is running out.  “As of today if I can’t get hold of some more PPE stocks, some of my hospitals will run out in a week. In order to protect nurses, doctors and other health care workers, and to help to reduce infections, we need sufficient stocks of gloves, gowns and masks to continue to operate, and we are just not getting the right information on how we can access the stockpile.  “We have been endeavouring to do everything we can to manage stocks but we cannot and will not compromise the safety of our staff and ultimately our patients.”  NEW ZEALAND NEARS COMPLETE LOCKDOWN  New Zealand is moving to a near-complete societal lockdown within 48 hours as Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern aims to seize on a “window of opportunity” to contain COVID-19.  Military personnel will join with police in enforcing nationwide self-isolation under the unprecedented restrictions.  Schools and non-essential businesses will close, public transport and air travel will effectively end as the government ramps up its public coronavirus advisory to the maximum level from Thursday.  “Now is the time to put our plans into action,” Ms Ardern said.  “We need to act now, or risk the virus taking hold as it has elsewhere.  “We currently have 102 cases, but so did Italy once.”  NZ Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has told schools and non-essential businesses they must close amid the coronavirus pandemic. Picture: Getty Images  Ms Ardern’s announcement came as New Zealand confirmed a jump of 36 positive tests for the virus in the past 24 hours, including the first two cases of community transmission.  New Zealand has recorded 102 cases, and no deaths, of COVID-19. By comparison, Australia has recorded at least 1600 cases.  The draconian measures have been championed by public health experts and supported by all of New Zealand’s political parties.  They will take effect for at least four weeks, and dramatically change life as Kiwis know it.  Everyday human interactions will be limited to within households. Kiwis will be allowed outside to walk the dog, or exercise by themselves, or to visit supermarkets or health services.  But only industries deemed “essential” – including health and emergency services workers, police, some public servants and media – will be allowed to continue, and otherwise citizens will be asked to stay home.  Auckland’s White Cross Clinic starts testing for walk in patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Picture: Getty Images  Ms Ardern said fresh advice and modelling in the case of widespread transmission made the lockdown essential.  “If community transmission takes off in New Zealand the number of cases will double every five days,” she said.  “If that happens unchecked, our health system will be inundated, and tens of thousands of New Zealanders will die.”  Ms Ardern said she was fully aware of the sacrifices she was asking from Kiwis.  “I do not underestimate what I’m asking New Zealanders to do. It is huge. And I know it will feel daunting,” she said.  A statue outside a restaurant wears a mask in central Christchurch, New Zealand.

All of the isolation and difficult time entertaining children, it will literally save lives, thousands of lives.  “The worst case scenario is simply intolerable. It would represent the greatest loss of New Zealanders lives and our history. And I will not take that chance.”  Parliament will also be recalled for an emergency session on Wednesday, in which Ms Ardern will table an epidemic notice to enforce the lockdown.  It remains to be seen whether the New Zealand election can be held on September 19 as planned.   QUEENSLAND CLOSES BORDERS  Queensland’s borders will be closed in a bid to halt COVID-19 spreading across the state.  It comes after people were blocked from hanging out publicly and in large groups to comply with Australia’s strict new social shutdown policies. The state government made the decision on Monday.  Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk says the national closure of bars, pubs, clubs, casinos, indoor sports venues and religious venues to control coronavirus is being enforced.  Queenslanders must take the new measures seriously.  Council elections and by-elections in Currumbin and Ipswich are going ahead on Saturday after postal voting and pre-polling periods were extended to avoid mass crowds.  A man wearing a protective face mask is seen walking along the Queen Street Mall in Brisbane.

Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has already announced a 500-officer-strong taskforce to enforce the dramatic shutdowns announced by Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Sunday night.  Queensland announced a task force looking at Brisbane’s party precinct at the weekend.  “I talked yesterday about some tough love and more will be rolled out in the coming weeks and months,” Ms Palaszczuk said on Monday.  “We know that if we are all playing our part and we’re all working together, we can absolutely get through this.” She said there was light at the end of the coronavirus tunnel, but only if everyone followed orders to stay 1.5 metres away from each other, and the government’s social closure orders.  TELEHEALTH CONSULTATIONS TO ATTRACT MEDICARE REBATE  All doctors consultations will soon attract a Medicare rebate if they are conducted over the telephone under a major shift to stop the spread of coronavirus.  Health Minister Greg Hunt has finally agreed to the demands of every peak medical group to consider the change and is negotiating on how it will be rolled out.  Doctors have argued by requiring most patients to attend a doctor’s office in person patients were being put at risk of the virus in medical waiting rooms.  Doctors were also concerned they could contract the virus if they saw patients in person.  And doctors in quarantine because they were suspected of having the virus were unable to work because they were not being paid if they carried out patient consultations over the phone.  Mr Hunt said the Government is consulting with the AMA, RACGP ACRRM, RDAA to co‑design stage four of our telehealth whole of population response.  “The co-design will look to the best practise expansion of telehealth items for all patients, with or without COVID-19, to see any general practitioner, medical specialist, mental health or allied health professional during the COVID-19 health emergency,” he said.  Australian Medical Association president Dr Tony Bartone said that the AMA was working very closely with Health Minister Greg Hunt to deliver better telehealth access to all Australians as a matter of urgency in this crisis.  “The Government is committed to further changes to Medicare to support a comprehensive telehealth model of care, and this includes finalising the detail of further telehealth operations via phone and video by the end of this week,” Dr Bartone said.  “This commitment will see the Government co-design the best practice expansion of telehealth items for all patients, with or without COVID-19, to see any GP or other medical specialist during the COVID-19 health emergency,” he said.  MILLIONS AFFECTED BY HOSPO CLOSURES  Up to a quarter of a million workers are affected by the closure of pubs and other venues at noon today.  Australian Hotels Association CEO Stephen Ferguson said it was a sad day for pubs but the health of staff and patrons was paramount.  “In times like this, it is essential for us all to follow the instructions of our Governments and medical officers,” Mr Ferguson said.  “But there’s no doubt this move is already having a devastating impact on our direct national workforce of 250,000 and our millions of patrons.  “We saw what an important role hotels play in their communities during the recent bushfires across large parts of the nation – today’s closure is an unprecedented move which will have a big social impact for months to come.  “Our hoteliers, their families and staff are obviously devastated – we are doing all we can for them.”  PARAMEDICS PLAYING RUSSIAN ROULETTE WITH THEIR HEALTH  Frontline paramedics are concerned they are not being informed whether patients they are racing to help have COVID-19 and as a result they are not wearing proper protective gear.  The Australian Paramedics Association (NSW) said it had received reports of paramedics attending multiple cases a day where they don’t have enough information to make a decision about whether to use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).  There is not enough personal protective gear at ambulance stations and this means paramedics have to make a choice about which cases carry the highest risk.  Paramedics are not wearing protective gear putting them at risk of COVID-19. Picture: Istock  “We are deeply concerned that this may turn paramedics into ‘super spreaders’ of the virus,”  APA (NSW) President and operational Paramedic Chris Kastelan said.  “We support paramedics standing off at scene until accurate information can be obtained. We are asking NSWA to establish more robust processes. Paramedics are at the frontline of our health system and we simply cannot risk having them contract this virus,” he said.  MYGOV WEBSITE CRASHES AS CENTRELINK SWAMPED  Long queues snaked around Centrelink offices around the country today as the Federal Government’s online portal for unemployment benefits crashed under the increased strain caused by coronavirus lockdown measures.  Both the Centrelink app and the entire MyGov portal fell over shortly before 9am AEDT, with users unable to log into their accounts to update their information or register for allowances including Newstart.  Some users on DownDetector said the MyGov portal had been suffering outages since Friday, and had stopped accepting file uploads.  Social media users also reported being unable to get through to Centrelink over the phone, instead met with messages to call back later.  Long queues at Centrelink Darlinghurst, Sydney.  The platform’s crash came the day after Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced stringent lockdown measures to ensure social distancing in an effort to stop the spread of COVID-19 in Australia.  Clubs, pubs, sporting venues, churches, cinemas, gyms and casinos will all shut their doors at midday today across the country.  Restaurants and cafes will also close, but be allowed to serve takeaway, while essential services – including retail shops, offices, workplaces and schools – will remain open, the prime minister announced last night.  Schools will be required to stay open until the end of term, and continue after the holidays provided health advice does not change, however parents will be allowed to keep their children at home if they want to.  ‘THIS WILL PUT US TO THE TEST’: PM  Australians are being urged to stick together as they face what will be the most challenging year of their lives.  In an address to a socially distanced House of Representatives in Canberra, Scott Morrison invoked the spirit of the Diggers.  “So we summon the spirit of the Anzacs, of our great Depression generation, of those who built the Snowy, of those who won the great peace of World War II and defended Australia,” Mr Morrison said.  Australian Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese uses hand sanitiser as he attends a parliamentary sitting under rules of social distancing.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison urges Australians to do their part to fight COVID-19.

Mr Morrison said the elected parliamentarians had “important work to do” today.  It is not yet known how many days federal parliament will sit this week, with Mr Morrison yesterday flagging it could be the final time it sits physically for a number of months.  Mr Morrison addressed small business owners who were concerned for the viability of what they have built.  “This is devastating and it is heartbreaking,” he said.  “We will do all we can … to see you through.  “There will be more support to come.”  Scott Morrison addressing a shrunk parliament. Picture: Getty Images  The leader urged people of faith to turn to their god in this trying time, despite places of worship being closed from noon Monday.  “I can assure you, my prayers knees are getting a workout,” Mr Morrison said.  He insisted the country would get though the challenge.  “We will be stronger on the other side,” he said.  Labor leader Anthony Albanese addressed the parliament after the Prime Minister.  He assured the government Labor would not stand in the way of any legislation in relation to stimulus or health.  “This is a time for national leadership, consistent messages, clear directions,” he said.  STRICT NEW MEASURES RESULT OF RISE IN CASES  During the 11th hour announcement following a tense national cabinet meeting with every state and territory leader, Mr Morrison lamented the possibility Australian children would lose a year of their education and said parents who chose to keep their child home must be responsible for them.  “Those children staying at home, it is not an excuse for them to go down to the shopping centre or to go and congregate somewhere else or potentially put themselves in contact with the vulnerable and elderly population,” he said.  “If you choose to keep your child at home … it is important that they observe the strict social distancing arrangements that have been advised to the public.”  Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.

The head of Italy’s Civil Protection Agency, Angelo Borrelli, noted that the increases had narrowed from recent days, adding “we hope that this trend can be confirmed in the coming days. We should not lower our guard.”  Mr Morrison said the new local measures are considered “Stage 1,” but further restrictions have not been decided and would depend on medical advice and the spread of coronavirus in Australia.  Mr Morrison said the closure of non-essential social venues would not in any way impact the operation of supermarkets, bottle shops and other retail stores, cautioning Australians against unnecessary panic buying.  “There’s no need for that,” he said.  “We are not putting in place lockdowns that … confine (people) to their home.  “Shopping centres are not closed.”  Mr Morrison said while churches and other places of worship would be closed, indoor services for funerals would still be allowed provided the strict rule of one person per four square metres and no more than 100 people in total were followed.  Workplaces and offices must follow the same arrangements, but can remain open.  Hotels can continue to operate the accommodation part of their business, but not any licensed pub or club areas.  Chief Medical Officer Professor Brendan Murphy said the strict new measures had been brought in partly due to the rise in coronavirus cases in Australia and also because the public had not been practising social distancing effectively.

Picture: Gary Ramage  “People have not been getting the messages and … we’ve recommended unanimously that these fairly dramatic and drastic recommendations be put in place because we have to stop those situations where viruses pass readily,” he said.  “We’ve had some events in Australia where 35 people have picked up the virus from one particular function.  “We cannot allow this sort of spread to happen.”  Pictures of a crowded Bondi Beach shocked the world and angered Australian officials. Picture: Brendan Read  Prof Murphy said Australians needed to learn to “live differently”.  “We’ve seen some irresponsible behaviour from people who were told to quarantine and have not, and they have spread the virus,” he said.  “You are putting your fellow Australians at risk if you break that rule so please, every one of us has to do our bit.  “We have to save our vulnerable Australians from what could be – and we’ve seen this in other countries – fairly devastating impacts if we get a widespread pandemic in this country.”  Singapore-based Australian scientist Professor Dale Fisher told 60 Minutes he was concerned that Australians weren’t taking self-isolation measures seriously enough – and warned the pandemic had only just started.  “This hasn’t started. I don’t want to be alarmist because this is something we can control, but the world needs to wake up,” Prof Dale said.  “We’re in a holding pattern until we can get a vaccine or a treatment. Every country really just has to minimise the effect, contain the spread and keep the curve underneath the capacity of the health system.”  PM WARNS AUSSIES AS LOCKDOWN LOOMS  Earlier, Mr Morrison warned schools could be closed for the “entire year” if Australians don’t co-operate with authorities to stem the spread of the coronavirus.  Victorian schools are to close on Tuesday, with the state bringing forward the Easter holidays.  Other states and territories are open to the idea but have not finalised any decisions.  Mr Morrison said current medical advice was that closing schools would not be useful as it would lead to problems in securing enough doctors, nurses and other health professionals.  However, he said the states and territories could be forced to take “severe measures” if Australians continued to ignore warnings to maintain safe distances from other people, stay home from work if sick, and limit travel.  “If there is not a broad co-operation in the population … states will have to take more severe measures,” Mr Morrison told ABC TV tonight.  “(The restrictions) just won’t be for a couple of weeks. I mean kids could lose their entire year of school. That’s what’s at stake here.” Mr Morrison said in an earlier interview his family was heeding current medical advice.  “My kids will be going to school in the morning and … we will be following the medical advice,” Mr Morrison said.  Prime Minister Scott Morrison speaks with NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian (on screen) during a national cabinet meeting to discuss COVID-19 from the telepresence room of Parliament House in Canberra. Picture: AAP  “For those health workers and others, a complete closure of schools across the country would take out 30 per cent of our health workforce.  “Now, you could imagine what the health impact would be.” Mr Morrison said the evidence remained that the incidence of coronavirus among younger people was far lower than for the rest of the population. “But we will continue to consider all of these issues based on the expert advice,” he said.  “We will do that in a calm and reasoned manner … all working together and being nationally co-ordinated in our responses.” Labor leader Anthony Albanese said it was important to have a consistent approach in terms of schools, questioning whether the prime minister’s national cabinet was unified.  “One of the concerns that has been out there is the changing messages from day to day,” he said.  “If you think a decision is going to be made next week or the week after, make it today.  “Because the sooner we act, the more effective it will be.” Mr Morrison said it was naive to think there could be a one-size-fits-all approach across the states and territories.  “They need to make the decision about how much further they go … on the basis of the health advice they have and the specific situation in their state,” he said.

AFL SUSPENDED, NRL TO PLAY ON  The AFL has taken the dramatic decision to suspend its 2020 competition, with boss Gillon McLachlan saying “the AFL industry is facing its biggest financial crisis”.  But rival code the NRL is refusing to close down its season at this stage amid reports all 16 teams in the competition could be moved to Sydney – or even a tiny town in Central Queensland – to overcome lockdowns and travel bans.  At this stage, the AFL competition – which was already being played in empty stadiums – is on hold until at least May 31. But the drastic measure could well continue past that date depending on medical advice.  “To say this is the most serious crisis to hit our league in 100 years is an understatement,” AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan said in announcing the decision.  “As a community and as a code, we all need to take the unprecedented and required actions to get through this together.”  The match between West Coast and Melbourne in Perth on Sunday afternoon was the final AFL game before the competition was suspended. Picture: Getty  The AFL Women’s season will also be shut down and no premiership given out.  Describing the decision as “a temporary halt”, McLachlan said: “We will review the situation by the end of April to determine whether a further suspension period would be required. The May 31 resumption time will be reviewed and depending on the medical advice and government regulations in place the date could be extended out.  “The decision by various state governments to close their borders and travel bans and other measures meant it was time for the AFL to immediately stop the AFLW and AFL competitions.  “The AFL industry is facing its biggest financial crisis in our history.  “Over the next 48 hours, both the AFL and clubs will detail the drastic and immediate steps we need to take to cut costs.  “Our key priority is to do everything possible to keep players, staff and supporters healthy and well through this pandemic.”  AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan. Picture: AAP  Meanwhile, the NRL is reportedly exploring an option to relocate its entire competition to Queensland in a last-ditch bid to save the game from a $500 million wipe out and extinction.  League officials were on Sunday night locked in emergency discussions in a desperate attempt to keep the 2020 premiership alive following the AFL’s decision to suspend its season immediately amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to the Courier Mail.  As states around Australia ramped up lockdown guidelines to slow the spread of COVID-19, the NRL was considering shifting all 16 clubs to the small Queensland town of Calliope, near Gladstone, where the 500 players and officials would live in a 1392-room purpose-built village once used as a miners’ camp.  The NRL has estimated abandoning the entire season will cost the game $500 million and almost certainly kill it.  The NRL has so far refused to bow to public pressure to shut down the competition and ARL Commission chairman Peter V’landys confirmed moving to Queensland was an option, while it has also been reported the competition could be consolidated in NSW.  ARLC Chairman Peter V’landys. Picture: Getty  “The AFL have got different circumstances. They’ve got teams throughout Australia where as we’ve only got them in three states. We can continue on without too much drama,” ARL Commission chairman Peter V’landys said.  “Relocation is definitely an option and we are looking at that right at the moment.  “Gladstone is the one place we could go to but there are some logistic problems to overcome before we go through with it. But certainly relocating the players is on the table.”  Prepare for Olympic delay: AOC to athletes  AOC TELLS ATHLETES TO PREPARE FOR OLYMPIC DELAY  The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) has told its athletes to prepare for a Tokyo Olympics in the northern summer of 2021.  The AOC says an Australian team can’t be assembled for the Tokyo Games, which is scheduled to start in July 24.  “We have athletes based overseas, training at central locations around Australia as teams and managing their own programs. With travel and other restrictions this becomes an untenable situation,” AOC chief executive Matt Carroll said in a statement today.  Tokyo 2020 Olympics officials excitedly receive the Olympic flame in Tokyo. The IOC may be about to blow it out. Picture: AP  It follows Prime Minister Scott Morrison telling Australia’s athletes they won’t be going to the Tokyo Olympics in July because the new ban on Australians travelling overseas applies to everyone – including any athletes selected for the Olympics.  “The AOC will make their decision but the simple answer is that we have a complete travel ban to the rest of the world, so the smartraveller advice and the advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs I think is pretty clear,” he told 7 News.  “The health of all Australians is the most important thing and there’s nothing more important than that.”  ITALY’S TRAGIC DEATH TOLL SHOWS NO SIGN OF SLOWING  Italy’s world-topping toll from the coronavirus pandemic approached 5,500 on Sunday after the Mediterranean country reported another 651 deaths.  The latest daily toll was smaller than Saturday’s record 793 fatalities but still the second-highest registered during Italy’s month-long crisis.  The number of new infections rose by 10.4 per cent to 59,138. Italy’s death toll now stands at 5,476.  “The figures announced today are lower than those for yesterday,” Italian civil protection service chief Angelo Borrelli told reporters.  Italian soldiers patrol the square facing Duomo gothic cathedral in downtown Milan, Italy. Picture: AP  “I hope and we all hope that these figures can be borne out in the coming days. But do not let your guard down.” Sunday’s figures suggest that strict containment measures imposed around the northern epicentre of the crisis near Milan on March 8 might be starting to bear fruit.  Milan’s Lombardy region reported just 30.4 per cent of the new infections on Sunday.  It had been reporting about two-thirds of Italy’s coronavirus deaths throughout the crisis.  The region of 10 million officially registered 55.5 per cent of Sunday’s COVID-19 deaths.  “We must not get too enthusiastic or over-interpret things,” Italian government scientific committee expert Franco Locatelli said.  But “it is a sign that we welcome positively,” he said.  The pandemic has put northern Italy’s world-class healthcare system under massive strain.  Sunday’s figures showed the number of patients receiving intensive care rising above 3,000 for the first time.  Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. Picture: AFP  Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced stricter measures on Sunday Australian time as he desperately tries to slow the epidemic.  “This is the most difficult challenge after the war,” he said.  “We will close all non-crucial production activities. But supermarkets, food, pharmacies and parapharmacies will remain open.”  Mr Conte said those who died were not just numbers, but people with families who were mourning them.  “We are living a nightmare,” he said.  PM’S $189 BILLION VIRUS PLAN  Casual, self-employed and other workers who have lost income due to the coronavirus shut down will be paid at least $550 a fortnight to help them survive the next six months.  Pensioners will receive a second $750 cash hit in July, while businesses who keep on employees will get up to $100,000 to stay afloat amid the deepening economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  The economic measures designed to boost Australia’s “safety net” unveiled by the federal government yesterday are expected to cost $66 billion, with plans for a third wave of spending already underway.  People suffering hardship will also be allowed to take out up to $20,000 from their superannuation across two financial years.  Prime Minister Scott Morrison during a press conference at Parliament House on Sunday. Picture: Getty Images  Anyone who has lost work because of the coronavirus crisis will be able to apply for the jobseeker allowance – which is up to about $550 a fortnight – and get an additional short-term top of $550, meaning many unemployed people will be eligible for $1100 a fortnight.  About one million Australians are expected to take up the coronavirus supplement payment, which has no waiting period and will not be asset tested.  Mr Morrison said the economic plan – announced just 10 days after the first stimulus package – brought the government’s measures to $189 billion.  “That is unprecedented in this country,” he said.  “We will be supercharging our safety net.  “We’ll be supporting the most vulnerable to the impacts of the crisis, those who will feel those first blows.”   MORE NEWS  Drastic super plan to cut virus impact  How retailers are fighting for your dollar during outbreak  Online shoppers warned of delays due to coronavirus  Mr Morrison warned the government’s two rescue packages – totalling about ten per cent of Australia’s GDP – would not be the last.  “There will be more issues that even now have not presented themselves or could not even be conceived at this point with what we may face over the next six months,” he said.  “We will be working night and day to ensure we bring forward the measures Australia needs to get them on this bridge to the recovery on the other side.”  Mr Morrison said people who qualified for the coronavirus supplement through the jobseeker allowance would also gain access to “normal” benefit payments including rental assistance, family tax benefits and the pharmaceutical allowance.  The prime minister said Australians’ compliance with social distancing rules, such as stopping unnecessary travel, staying 1.5m away from others and avoiding crowds directly impacted the government’s ability to keep the country running.  “People cannot be cavalier about these things,” he said.  “They must take them extremely seriously because lives and livelihoods are at stake.  “But the more social distancing we do, the less severe the economic impacts have to be.”  Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said from July 13 everyone on income support who is not eligible for the coronavirus supplement will get an extra $750 in cash, which is on top of the $750 due to hit welfare recipients’ bank accounts from the end of March.  Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and PM Scott Morrison during a press conference at Parliament House in Canberra. Picture: Gary Ramage  “This includes those receiving the age pension, a carers allowance, family tax benefit and  the Commonwealth senior card. 5.2 million Australians in total,” he said.  Mr Frydenberg said Australians in financial stress will also be able to access more of their money in superannuation.  “From April, those affected will gain access to that superannuation, capped at $10,000 this financial year and a further $10,000 next financial year,” he said.  Mr Frydenberg said the government would also give retirees more “flexibility” to manage their super by halving the required drawdown amount.  The government has lowered deeming rates in line with the Reserve Bank’s emergency rates cut, which is expected to help up to 900,000 pensioners.  The government’s package for small and medium businesses also includes a cash injection of at least $20,000 up to a possible $100,000, which will also apply to not for profit organisations with a turnover of less than $50 million.  Australians in financial stress will also be able to access more of their money in superannuation, says Treasurer Josh Frydenberg. Picture: Gary Ramage  “This will be a lifeline for hundreds of thousands of employers, like the local hairdresser, the local coffee shop, the local mechanic whose income has been significantly reduced over this difficult period,” Mr Frydenberg said.  The Commonwealth is also offering to guarantee unsecured loans of up to $250,000 for three years to encourage reluctant companies to borrow.  The government will also provide relief to directors of corporations for personal liability when the company is trading while insolvent.  Mr Frydenberg said the global and domestic economic environment had seriously deteriorated in the short time since the government’s first stimulus package.  “We now expect the economic shock to be deeper, wider and longer,” he said.  “Every arm of government and industry is working to keep Australians in jobs and businesses in business and to build a bridge to recovery on the other side.”  Labor’s treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers said the opposition was concerned the response “lacks urgency” and did not go far enough to protect jobs, but would work with the government to get the legislation through parliament.  “Every Australian needs the Government to get this right, which means getting the original stimulus and today’s additional measures out the door as soon as possible, and urgently closing the gaps identified by Labor and others,” he said.  A special reduced federal parliament of just 90 MPs will sit today to pass the emergency measures and ensure cash can flow to recipients as soon as possible.  It is hoped this could be completed within two days, but the prime minister has conceded the parliament may not be able to convene to pass future economic measures.  “We have to be conscious of the fact that because of the spread of the virus, it may not be physically possible to convene the parliament over the next six months,” Mr Morrison said.  “So the plan is to move to a much more emergency mode operation for the parliament, but … ensuring that any of the measures that are taken to support Australians are done so consistent with our parliamentary democracy.”  NEW YORK CASES SOAR ALARMINGLY  New York’s coronavirus cases jumped 46 per cent in a single day as its leaders said “people would die” if the US government doesn’t step up its assistance.  The state now accounts for five per cent of the world’s coronavirus cases and has become the worst hit in America.  Mayor Bill de Blasio said New York City’s hospitals were racing toward calamity, as the city’s death toll climbed to 64, with almost 10,000 positive cases.  “All military personnel who are medically trained should be sent to places where this crisis is deep, like New York, right now,” Mr de Blasio said.

US Senator Rand Paul. Picture: AFP, Republican of Kentucky, walks to participate in a series of votes related to a bill in response  “That’s not the way it should be,” he said.  “This is just an impossible situation to manage. If we don’t get the equipment, we can lose lives that we could have otherwise saved if we had the right equipment.”  Mr Cuomo announced four new hospitals would be established in existing structures across the state, including Stony Brook University, SUNY Old Westbury, the Javits Center and in Westchester County.  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Picture: AFP  Of the those who died in the state of New York, seventy per cent were aged over 70 years, and 80 per cent of the younger fatalities had underlying health conditions, he said.  “This is literally a matter of life and death,” Mr Cuomo said, calling on FEMA and the military to step in and help.  “[If] we get these facilities up, we get the supplies, we will save lives.  “If we don’t, we will lose lives.  “That is the simple fact of this matter. From my point of view, construction can start tomorrow.”  The number of cases across New York State reached 15,168, with 9,045 in the five boroughs, on Sunday, up 4,812 since the day before.  More than half the state’s cases are aged 18 to 49 years.  A nearly deserted Times Square. Picture: AP  Mr Cuomo said strict shutdowns across the state could last “four months, five months, nine months”.  “We’re in that range,” he said.   “Start planning accordingly.”  Meanwhile, key President Trump ally Rand Paul became the first US senator to test positive. He said he was unaware he had been in contact with anyone who was infected.  It follows two Democrat House members revealing they had also tested positive.  FOOD PARCELS FOR MILLIONS IN UK  Britain will deliver food parcels to up to 1.5 million people as it pleads with the sick, vulnerable and the elderly to stay at home for 12 weeks.  The UK is sending out letters to people over 70 and others considered at risk asking them to stay home.  They will also be offered help with food and medicine drops if they do not have a support network to keep them going.  Some parks are being closed in the UK, as people continue to gather despite social distancing rules demanding they stay two metres apart with Britain climbing up its coronavirus curve.  It comes as German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been quarantined after a doctor who treated her tested positive for coronavirus.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Picture: AP  In France, the first doctor has died as the toll hit 562, with almost 15,000 cases.  The country has ordered 250 million face masks.  Germany, along with the Chancellor being quarantined, has banned gatherings of more than two people, except for families.  Ms Merkel was told about her doctor’s positive test after delivering a media conference, raising concerns that she may have spread the virus if she was also infected.  Spain has planned to extend its lockdown beyond Easter as it closely follows Italy’s horrible coronavirus death toll, with 1,756 deaths.

STOCKS RISING Major stocks are climbing more or less as the G20 members have vowed to inject over 5 trillion U.S. dollars to boost the global economy, as part of their joint efforts to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.  U.S. stocks finished Thursday's session significantly higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring 1,351.62 points, or 6.38 percent, the S&P 500 advancing 154.51 points, or 6.24 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite Index jumping 413.24 points, or 5.60 percent.  All the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended higher, with utilities up 8.39 percent, representing the best-performing group.  Tokyo stocks opened sharply higher Friday, given that as of 9:15 a.m. local time (0015 GMT), the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 651.60 points, or 3.49 percent, from Thursday to 19,316.20.  Not coincidentally, the Australian share market also followed an upward trend on Friday. As of 10:30 local time (2330 GMT, Thursday), the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index was up 111.00 points or 2.17 percent at 5,224.30, while the broader All Ordinaries index was up 113.90 points or 2.22 percent at 5249.10.  GOVERNMENTS' RESPONSE As the pandemic is raising concerns over both the dropping demand and the disruption of supply chains, governments have acted to cushion shocks of the pandemic.  After South Korea unveiled a fiscal stimulus package worth about 80 billion dollars and unprecedented monetary policies last week, the country's central bank decided Thursday to add an \"unlimited\" liquidity supply to its emergency moves, with an open bidding to be held once a week by the end of June to provide liquidity to financial institutions.  On Wednesday, the U.S. Senate passed a 2-trillion-dollar stimulus package in a 96-0 vote to blunt the economic fallout of COVID-19. It remains to be approved by the House of Representatives, before being signed by President Donald Trump.  The bill aims to provide small businesses emergency loans, business tax breaks, expanded unemployment benefits, 1,000-dollar-plus direct payments for working Americans, government aid for industries, and more support for hospitals and state and local governments.  The United States has reported 82,404 coronavirus cases as of 6 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Thursday (2200 GMT), according to Johns Hopkins University, making it surpass China to become the one with most COVID-19 cases in the world.  Additionally, World Bank Group (WBG) President David Malpass said Thursday that the multilateral lender is now finalizing a package that could provide as much as 160 billion dollars in financial support for countries heavily hit by COVID-19.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also announced earlier this month that it is making available about 50 billion dollars through its rapid-disbursing emergency financing facilities for low-income and emerging market countries, and 10 billion dollars of that is intended to support the poorest members at zero interest.  INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION Despite the positive signals from stock markets and governments' efforts against the disease, it requires broader international and regional cooperation to pass the pandemic test.  The European Union pledged Thursday close cooperation in response to the pandemic, vowing to address issues ranging from medical supplies to internal market, as the continent has become an epicenter of the disease.  As of 0347 GMT Friday, a total of 80,589 cases have been reported in Italy, compared with 57,786 in Spain, 43,938 in Germany and 29,566 in France, according to Johns Hopkins University.  The bloc will do everything possible to support research, coordinate efforts in the continent against COVID-19, including those on vaccines, and work together with key partners in the Group of Seven and G20, said leaders of the EU and its member states in a joint statement.  Prior to the G20 leaders' summit on the same day, United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres asked the G20 for a \"wartime plan\" to fight the pandemic.  To suppress the transmission of the virus as quickly as possible, there must be a common strategy, said Guterres. \"It requires a coordinated G20 response mechanism guided by the WHO (World Health Organization).\"According to the Extraordinary G20 Leaders' Summit Statement on COVID-19, the group is committed to do whatever it takes to overcome the pandemic, along with the WHO, the IMF, the World Bank, the WBG, and other international organizations, working within their existing mandates.  \"We are determined to spare no effort, both individually and collectively,\" to protect lives, revive growth, minimize disruptions to trade and global supply chains and provide help to all countries in need of assistance, among other goals, said the statement.

The coronavirus pandemic’s effect on the film industry has been increasing in scope, with major releases such as No Time To Die and A Quiet Place Part II postponed indefinitely, and cinemas shutting until further notice.   Advert 10  Amid the self-isolation measures and natural anxiety in these trying times, it’d be understandable that some may have avoided venturing into screenings to catch the latest movies. Luckily, certain films are coming to streaming early as a result – including the scariest horror of the year so far.  The Invisible Man 2020 Universal Pictures  The latest twist on the classic comes from the brilliant mind of Leigh Whannell, the writer of Saw and director of Upgrade, and is currently sitting at 91% on Rotten Tomatoes.  It stars Elisabeth Moss as Cecilia Kass, who’s plagued by the apparent invisible presence of her abusive ex-partner (played by Oliver Jackson-Cohen) after escaping their home.   Advert 10  The Invisible Man 2020 Horror 4 Universal Pictures  The movie opens on an inhale and rarely loosens its grip on your pulse – throughout, you battle immense frustration as Cecilia is doubted by naysayers. Yet, we see her terrifying mental and physical torment behind closed doors in ways that are often unbearably difficult to endure.  Moss’s performance is utterly mesmerising – in a film landscape where releases are continually being delayed, she’s the immediate front-runner for Best Actress at the Oscars next year. But it’s also a mighty testament of Whannell’s talents (already exemplified by the bamboozling violence in Upgrade).  Could he be the answer to Universal’s Dark Universe problem? 2017’s The Mummy was, simply, a disaster – with Blumhouse’s track record for low-budget success, there’s surely something brewing behind the scenes.   Advert 10  The Invisible Man 2020 Horror 3 Universal Pictures  You’ll be able to stream The Invisible Man at home from this Friday, available on iTunes, Amazon and other providers. It’s a VOD release, priced at $19.99 for a 48-hour rental.  It’s dropping on home-viewing alongside The Hunt and Emma amid the widespread impact of COVID-19 on the theatrical market. Universal’s Trolls World Tour will also debut on-demand on April 10.  The Hunt 2020 Universal Pictures   Advert 10  Jeff Shell, CEO of NBCUniversal, said in a press conference Monday morning: ‘We hope and believe that people will still go to the movies in theaters where available, but we understand that for people in different areas of the world that is increasingly becoming less possible.’  There’s worse ways you can spend time during self-isolation.

Bettman said he came to decision Wednesday night after the NBA announced that a player tested positive, but wanted to talk with the NHL Board of Governors before making a formal announcement, which came Thursday afternoon.  “The last couple of weeks, we, like everybody else, have been monitoring what’s been going on, and we went from dealing with things on a day-to-day basis to an hour-by-hour basis, and then it was in minutes,” Bettman told CNBC. “And we were constantly evolving our strategy as to how we were going to have our teams playing or not playing, or under what circumstances.  “But last night, when the NBA had a positive test and they had to cancel a game at that moment, it was clear to me. And through all of our calculus, we knew that once a player tested positive, it would be a game-changer.  “I decided it was time to get ahead of it and not wait for one of our players to get tested, because in all likelihood, at some point in time, we weren’t going to get through the rest of the season without a player testing positive.”  Bettman added that he is not sure how far into the summer the NHL could push the schedule as the league is taking a day-to-day approach with the development of the coronavirus.  He also wanted to make it clear that the season is on “pause” because it is his hope that things can go back to normal when it’s safe to do so.  “I’m a little hesitant to use the word suspension, because our hope and our expectation is, when things get back to normal and it’s safe and it’s prudent, that we can go back and resume the season and ultimately have the Stanley Cup awarded,” he said.  “… My hope is that at some point we’ll get back to some normalcy, and that’s not just my hope for the NHL, and it’s not just my hope for all sports, it’s my hope for everything that’s going on.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 11, "positive": 5, "trust": 2, "negative": 5, "joy": 2}, "metadata": ["nhl", "nba", "monitoring", "league", "expectation"]}, {"text": "The University of Tampa is reporting that five of its students have tested positive for the coronavirus after they traveled for spring break.  “UT has been notified that five UT students, traveling together and with other UT students during Spring Break, have tested positive for COVID-19.

So if this new Corona virus Covert 19 behaves as we believe that it does, then someone who has gotten it should have developed immunity to it and therefore should not get it again. And I just would emphasize that this is what we know as of right now that you should develop immediately to it. Can you get this twice? There's some preliminary scientific data showing no, but the first case was first described at the end of November, so it's really too early to be sure whether or not reinfection is possible. The answer, hopefully, will be No. Dr Goodman, we've got a question here from J. J in Denver. He wants to know if and when a vaccine is made available should everyone get vaccinated or only those who are sick. One thing that could be considered it. We may be able to use blood testing to identify people who have already been exposed and our immune, and if so, they might not need it. But right now, if if this virus way wonder this storm amounts go down. But there's not evidence that everybody is immune and a vaccine is available, it's something that would use generally to help protect healthy people. In Washington, I'm chief national investigative correspondent Mark Albert.  Advertisement Does getting coronavirus once mean you are immune? Share Shares Copy Link Copy  Misinformation on the novel coronavirus can be found almost anywhere online, particularly about how to kill the virus or become immune. Mark Albert asked three doctors about the virus: Dr. Leana Wen, former health commissioner of Baltimore, infectious disease specialist Dr. Jodie Dionne-Odom, of the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Dr. Jesse Goodman, attending physician at Georgetown University. Here are their answers.Once you contract coronavirus, are you then immune from getting the disease again?Wen: It's a great question and it's one that we've been getting asked a lot from people who are concerned. So if this new coronavirus, COVID-19, behaves as we believe that it does, then someone who has gotten it should have developed immunity to it and therefore you should not get it again.

But specialists in the field of occupational safety say that regular masks are not adequate to protect against COVID-19, and probably have caused thousands of illnesses among healthcare workers.  “There’s no doubt in my mind that’s one of the reasons that so many healthcare workers are getting sick and many are dying,” said Jonathan Rosen, a health and safety expert who advises unions, states and the federal government. As of April 23, according to The Guardian, more than 21,800 healthcare workers had contracted the coronavirus and 71 have died.  Surgical masks, designed to protect patients from a surgeon’s respiratory droplets, are not effective in blocking particles smaller than 100 microns. South Korean researchers say that COVID-19 particles are less than 0.1 microns and can pass thought a surgical mask with ease. According to The Guardian, N95 respirators will block 95 percent of tiny air particles down to 0.3 microns.  And even if health care workers supply their own equipment, their efforts may be thwarted. An article published in ProPublica reveals that a Florida emergency room nurse brought her own N95 mask to work. The hospital policies, however, did not allow staff to wear N95 masks when treating patients who were not diagnosed with the coronavirus. The nurse was taken to task and she left on unpaid leave. This scenario has been echoed in other states as well, according to The Guardian.  National Nurses United is pushing to have more N95 masks available and is also asking Congress to mandate employers provide healthcare workers with protective equipment when they interact with COVID-19 patients.  “Nurses are not afraid to care for out patients if we have the right protections,” said Bonnie Castillo, the executive director of National Nurses United, “but we’re not martyrs sacrificing our lives because our government and our employers didn’t do their job.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 2, "positive": 15, "negative": 2, "disgust": 2, "anger": 2, "fear": 5}, "metadata": ["masks", "healthcare", "jonathan", "coronavirus", "respiratory", "researchers", "florida", "hospital", "treating", "diagnosed", "united", "pushing", "congress", "employers", "protective"]}, {"text": " CLOSE  GREEN LAKE - Green Lake County health officials on Sunday announced the county's first confirmed case of COVID-19.

Spokesperson Becky Brown tells News 3, “We are following the same protocol used for flu outbreaks which include disinfecting contaminated areas and asking those who are sick to stay at home.”  Brown says the system continues to encourage everyday preventive actions in our schools to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases. Some of those actions include:  Avoid close contact with people who are sick.  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.  Stay home when you are sick.  Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.  Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.  Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.

Law enforcement personnel are worried that widespread rioting and looting can erupt if the government doesn’t get its act together quickly. In particular, the island of Sicily, Italy’s southernmost region, is turning into a powder keg.  Police have been deployed in droves in the regional capital of Palermo due to reports that gangs are ramping up activity by using social media to plan future attacks on stores. One such group on Facebook called National Revolution, which has about 2,600 members, is urging their group members to not pay for their grocery store purchases. Palermo’s supermarkets have seen an increased police presence as a result of one such raid.  On Monday, Tirrenia CIN, a ferry company that has been delivering vital goods to Sicily, the western island region of Sardinia and other minor islands, halted its services due to financial difficulties. This will potentially make matters worse as food supplies run low. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said in a statement that the government will find a way to ensure that vital goods continue to be delivered.  As the Italian government creaks under the strain of the COVID-19 pandemic, officials are worried that the Italian mafia and other underground elements are preparing to take over.  Authorities are taking this threat so seriously that the government is making distribution of aid to the country’s underdeveloped southern regions a top priority.  “We need to act fast, more than fast,” said Leoluca Orlando, mayor of Palermo, Sicily. “Distress could turn into violence.”  Italian government preparing to provide billions in aid to the south  On March 10, Conte’s government unveiled an aid package of over 25 billion euros (around $27.5 billion) designed to protect workers and businesses during the pandemic. He is currently trying to channel some of those aid funds toward the Italian south. Over the weekend, he moved 4.3 billion euros from a “solidarity fund” to help municipalities cope with the lost revenue. He also added 400 million euros that mayors can convert into coupons for groceries. “No one will be left behind,” said Conte in a televised address.  But southern leaders are saying that this still isn’t enough. The aid from the solidarity fund, they claim, won’t be enough to save the economy of Southern Italy from breaking down. According to research group Prometeia, economic output is set to shrink by as much as 6.5 percent in 2020, and most of this damage will be felt by the poorer southern region.  The lockdown, for instance, is disproportionately affecting the south because the region has more Italians employed in the underground economy.  According to Stefano Paolini, a police union leader, there are more workers in the south who “live day-to-day, doing odd jobs, like unloading trucks at markets, and they are in trouble” because they can’t easily access the unemployment benefits and aid provided for regular workers.  Giuseppe Provenzano, Minister for the South in Conte’s cabinet, understands that an “emergency handout” also needs to be given to southern Italians working in the underground economy. If this doesn’t happen, Provenzano warns that various elements of organized crime, such as the mafia, may step up to provide assistance that the government fails to give.  Southern Italy bracing for new coronavirus onslaught  As Italy’s national lockdown enters its fourth week, the northern Italian region of Lombardy is beginning to see the effects of the quarantine. While the number of COVID-19 cases is still rising, health officials are beginning to see progress as they receive smaller numbers of new cases each day. While coronavirus fears are beginning to relax in the north, the south is bracing itself for a wave of new cases.  In an open letter address to Prime Minister Conte, Vincenzo De Luca, regional president (governor) of the southern Italian region of Campania wrote: “At this point there is the real prospect that Lombardy’s tragedy is about to become the south’s tragedy. We are on the eve of a major expansion of infections which may not be sustainable.”  Hospitals in southern Italy have already begun bracing themselves as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the region grows. The rise in cases has been particularly steep in the regions of Puglia, Lazio and Campania. Many are placing the blame on people from Lombardy who fled south.  Several regional presidents in the south have even asked for their borders to be closed off from fleeing northern Italians. After some 30,000 people from the north landed in Sicily, the Sicilian government stopped almost all flights.  Many regional presidents in Italy’s south are worried that their decaying health systems simply won’t be able to cope with the pandemic the way their northern neighbors have been able to. In recent years, healthcare across the underdeveloped region has been plagued with budget cuts. More than 40 hospitals have already closed because of this, and many hospitals still don’t have enough protective equipment for them to properly address the crisis.  “The next few days will still be very difficult,” said Giorgio Sestili, a southern Italian doctor. “But the fundamental thing over the next few weeks will be how the regions in the center-south perform, because if we succeed in keeping it under control there, we can hope for a positive outcome.”   Sources include:   Bloomberg.com 1   Bloomberg.com 2   BBC.com   TheGuardian.com  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 11, "positive": 34, "negative": 6, "joy": 2, "anger": 4, "fear": 17, "trust": 4}, "metadata": ["coronavirus", "northern", "deployed", "media", "facebook", "minister", "ensure", "mayor", "economy", "italy", "economic", "unemployment", "onslaught", "lockdown", "de", "borders", "pandemic", "healthcare", "protective"]}, {"text": "New Zealand will start re-opening schools and businesses next Monday, prime minister Jacinda Ardern said today as she hailed the country's success in stopping an 'uncontrolled explosion' of coronavirus.  Ardern said that New Zealand has 'done what very few countries have been able to do... we have stopped a wave of devastation.'  The maximum Alert Level 4 will be lifted from April 27, dropping to Level 3 which means some schools can re-open and gatherings of up to 10 people will be allowed for event such as weddings and funerals.  The new rules mean people can expand their 'immediate household bubble' to 'reconnect with close family' or support isolated people.  Businesses in the construction, manufacturing and forestry industries can return to work, while shops and restaurants will remain shut but takeaways can resume.  While announcing the decision, Ms Ardern paid tribute to Kiwis who have maintained physical distancing and made sacrifices during the clampdown  New Zealand imposed a Level 4 lockdown on March 26, when the country still had fewer than 100 cases. The country had already shut its borders on March 19.  As a result, the country has seen only 1,105 confirmed cases and 12 deaths in total, with only a handful of new infections recorded in recent days.  Ardern said the transmission rate (R) - the average number of people that each sick person infects - was now just 0.48. The average elsewhere is 2.5, she said.  'Nearly every case identified since April 1 is as a result of overseas travel or contact with someone with the virus, often in existing clusters,' the PM said.  'The number of individual cases that don’t have an obvious connection in that period stands now at only eight.'  The Level 4 restrictions have seen Kiwis stuck in their homes for the past four weeks. They have only been allowed to leave to do food shopping, to seek medical care or for exercise.  Supermarkets remained open but all other food stores, such as cafes and restaurants were forced to close.  Ms Ardern said they considered ending level four restrictions earlier but wanted to give themselves 'some additional certainty'.  'We considered that the longer we are in lockdown, the less likely it is we will need to go back,' she said.  'The sacrifice made to date has been huge. And Cabinet wanted to make sure we lock in our gains, and give ourselves some additional certainty.  'Ultimately, we have taken a balanced approach, and one that the Director General of Health not only supported, but also recommended.'  This diagram shows the daily number of new infections in New Zealand (in yellow), which has fallen to only a handful per day, and the daily rate of increase (in red)  Jacinda Ardern has announced New Zealand will loosen its tough lockdown rules next week  She said level three allowed more economic activity like construction, manufacturing and forestry, but it does not allow more social activity.  'If we want to make sure that we are a health success story, and ensure our economy can start to operate again without the virus taking off, we need to get the next phase right.  'The worst thing we can do for our country is to yo-yo between levels, with all of the uncertainty that this would bring.'  While announcing the decision, Ms Ardern paid tribute to Kiwis who have maintained physical distancing and made sacrifices during the clampdown.  'The effort of our team of five million has broken the chain of transmission,' she said.  'All of you have stopped the uncontrolled explosion of COVID-19 in New Zealand and I couldn't be prouder.'  Medical staff test a shopper who volunteered at a pop-up community COVID-19 testing station at a supermarket carpark in Christchurch, New Zealand, Friday, April 17  New Zealand began testing for the virus as long ago as January 22, although it did not confirm a positive case until February 26.  As early as March 14, all new arrivals into New Zealand were ordered into self-isolation, while cruise ships were banned.  New Zealand had only 32 confirmed cases on March 18, when Ardern announced that all non-residents and non-citizens were banned from entering the country.  Ardern announced a total Level 4 lockdown from March 26, at which point there were 363 confirmed cases.  Current figures show there are 1,105 confirmed cases of which only seven were added to the tally in the last 24 hours.  There are another 335 'probable' cases including two new ones. Only 14 people are currently in hospital, down by four since yesterday.  A total of 86,305 people have been tested in a country of 5million, the equivalent of one in every 57 people.

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky, File)  This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.  ATLANTA (AP) — As more states begin to relax their coronavirus lockdowns, most are falling short of the minimum levels of testing suggested by the federal government and recommended by a variety of public health researchers, an Associated Press analysis has found.  Three months into an unprecedented public health emergency, the White House has largely resisted calls for a coordinated plan to conduct the millions of tests experts say are needed to contain the virus. What federal officials outlined recently isn’t even an official benchmark, and AP’s analysis found that a majority of states are not yet meeting it.  With no specific guidelines, states are left to figure out what a successful testing program should be while they simultaneously try to reopen their shattered economies. If states don’t have robust testing, public health experts say they will be unable to detect outbreaks quickly enough to contain them, which could lead to more shutdowns.  “It’s dangerous and irresponsible,” said Lawrence Gostin, a public health specialist at Georgetown University.  In many states, testing has been limited to hospitalized patients, high-risk individuals and front-line workers. But most public health experts agree that containing the virus will require a massive expansion of testing that eventually includes millions of patients without symptoms, which is not happening now.  A testing blueprint released Monday by the Trump administration lacked any metrics state officials could use to make informed decisions. Instead, the document made clear that states are responsible for testing, saying the federal government is the “supplier of last resort.”  The closest the White House has come to issuing a benchmark does not actually appear in the document. At a recent briefing, senior administration officials said the government would provide each state with enough tests, swabs and related materials to screen at least 2.6% of their populations in May and June. Those hit harder by the outbreak would be eligible for additional assistance.  It was unclear how the 2.6% figure was reached. When asked about it, officials with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services described it as 2% of state populations per month without explaining the discrepancy. Officials also did not respond to questions about whether the administration has a target for how many daily tests should be done nationwide or when it would issue more details.  Only about 40% of states currently meet even the 2% testing threshold, according to AP’s analysis. The percentage is expected to rise as states increase their testing capabilities. The AP based the monthly testing rate for each state on the average number of new daily tests over the most recent 7 days. The data is from the COVID Tracking Project and includes counts up to April 30th.  A White House spokesman said Friday that the administration’s testing threshold is only a suggestion and that states are ultimately responsible for deciding how to reopen in a “safe and responsible manner.” The administration says it is working to expand testing and has been highlighting plans first announced in March for additional testing sites at retail pharmacy chains.  States that do not meet the administration’s testing guidance, based on their current screening rates, include some that have been moving into the early stages of reopening, such as Colorado, South Carolina and Texas. Georgia, which has moved aggressively to ease restrictions and lift its stay-at-home order, is just under the 2% threshold.  Louisiana and Kansas, where Republican lawmakers have been putting pressure on Democratic governors to reopen, are falling short, according to the AP analysis. In Kansas, the governor and top health administrator expect to reach the 2% mark this month.  Florida, which announced its first phase of reopening will start next week, also falls short but has said it will be able to test 30,000 to 40,000 people a day if needed. Michigan, where the Republican-led legislature has sued the Democratic governor over the state’s stay-at-home order, is on track to test 2.2% of its population.  Former health officials and experts were critical of the testing blueprint and said the 2.6% or 2% population metric was too vague and didn’t take into account guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control on who should be tested.  “Why don’t they say, ‘We’ll test everybody with any symptoms of coronavirus and all their contacts?’” said Dr. James Curran, a former assistant U.S. surgeon general who worked at CDC for 25 years. “If that amounts to 2% that’s fine, but the guidelines are not to test 2%. The guidelines are to test who needs it.”  Many experts already say the national testing rate falls short of what is needed to safely ease social distancing guidelines.  Researchers at Harvard have calculated that the U.S. needs to be testing roughly 500,000 people per day before considering easing restrictions this month. That’s a nearly 150% increase from the recent daily tally of approximately 200,000 tests.  “I’ve described it and I still describe it as an absolute bare minimum,” said Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.  More than half of states are not testing their populations at the daily rate recommended by Jha and his colleagues. The Harvard team developed their statistics in mid-April and noted that projections for U.S. cases have increased since then.  Many states hardest hit by the crisis failed to reach the team’s testing recommendations, even if they were already testing more than 2% of their populations, according to an AP analysis using state-by-state figures provided by Harvard. States falling short of the Harvard numbers include many of the epicenters of the outbreak, including New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts.  Jha and his colleagues based their testing targets, in part, on the number of tests needed to screen enough people to push positive results below 10%, the level that the World Health Organization considers sufficient to contain the outbreak. More than 16% of U.S. tests nationwide are positive for the virus, according to figures compiled by the COVID Tracking Project website. That compares with a rate of about 3% in South Korea, a country praised for its aggressive testing.  Former CDC director Tom Frieden has recommended double the current testing levels. He said the U.S. should be testing at minimum 400,000 people a day.  Officials in at least 20 states have indicated their testing capacity is not adequate and said they are taking steps to address this, according to a review by the AP. But there is little consensus among states on how many people should be tested or whether that should include those with no symptoms.  Georgia, where in-person dining at restaurants is now permitted with restrictions, has not said how many people it would like to test but recently touted its ability to test over 20,000 people on a single day and has encouraged more people to get tested. New Jersey, which has a slightly smaller population and a higher number of COVID-19 cases, has said it would need to conduct 20,000 to 30,000 tests a day to reopen.  Ohio wants to increase testing from 7,200 per day to 22,000 by May 27. Washington state, which has seen one of the largest U.S. outbreaks, has reported averaging 4,650 tests a day and wants to do more than 22,000 but lacks the necessary supplies.  Most states have convened advisory panels to help in setting guidelines, but they run the gamut in terms of expertise and will result in a patchwork of policies that experts say may be ineffective in containing a virus that doesn’t respect state borders.  “Treading water on testing is not going to get us out of this,” said Jeremy Konyndyk, a disaster preparedness expert who helped lead the Obama administration response to Ebola.

Officials in the country expect the drug to be available within 90 days after it has completed the necessary testing.  Science and Technology Minister Ofir Akunis said: 'Congratulations to MIGAL [The Galilee Research Institute] on this exciting breakthrough.  'I am confident there will be further rapid progress, enabling us to provide a needed response to the grave global COVID-19 threat.'  Scientists at MIGAL confirmed they have been working on a vaccine against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) found in poultry.  It has been tested at the Veterinary Institute where its said to have been proven effective.  An Israeli scientist works at a laboratory at the MIGAL Research Institute. Scientists there say they are just weeks away from developing an oral vaccine which will beat coronavirus  The virus has now infected more than 82,000 people globally and is worrying governments with its rapid spread beyond the epicenter of China  Dr. Chen Katz, MIGAL’s biotechnology group leader, said: 'Our basic concept was to develop the technology and not specifically a vaccine for this kind or that kind of virus.'  The oral vaccination induced high levels of specific anti-IBV antibodies in trials, according researchers.  MIGAL scientists say if they can 'adjust the system' from the poultry coronavirus to the human one they will have 'in a few weeks, if it all works, we would have a vaccine to prevent coronavirus'.  Dr Katz added: 'All we need to do is adjust the system to the new sequence.  'We are in the middle of this process, and hopefully in a few weeks we will have the vaccine in our hands. Yes, in a few weeks, if it all works, we would have a vaccine to prevent coronavirus.'  MIGAL CEO David Zigdon said : 'Given the urgent global need for a human coronavirus vaccine, we are doing everything we can to accelerate development.  'We are currently in intensive discussions with potential partners that can help accelerate the in-human trials phase and expedite completion of final-product development and regulatory activities.'  Officials said 33 people had tested positive for the virus in California as of Thursday, one day after the US' first unknown origin case was announced and the CDC was blasted for not testing the individual for four days.

Meanwhile, the drugmaker, Moderna, announced its candidate coronavirus vaccine has been shipped to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to begin phase 1 clinical trials in humans.  Chinese state media had reported scientists developed an oral vaccine for the new coronavirus using baker's yeast.  HOW WILL THE VACCINE WORK? Israeli cientists say they have been able to use the development of a vaccine against infectious bronchitis virus found in poultry to help them. Dr. Chen Katz said: 'Let’s call it pure luck. We decided to choose coronavirus as a model for our system just as a proof of concept for our technology.' Katz added: 'The scientific framework for the vaccine is based on a new protein expression vector, which forms and secretes a chimeric soluble protein that delivers the viral antigen into mucosal tissues by self-activated endocytosis, causing the body to form antibodies against the virus.' Endocytosis sees substances brought into the cell.

However, the expert said the product was still 'far from' being sold on the market because it needed to pass animal tests and clinical trials.  Multiple research teams have begun developing vaccines for the disease since an outbreak emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei Province late last year.  Last month, a Russian diplomatic mission in China said that Russia and China were working to develop a vaccine and that Beijing had handed over the genome of the virus to Moscow.  Johnson & Johnson is one of the drugmakers that have begun work on developing a vaccine for the coronavirus.  Jack Ma, China's richest man, donated $14million to help scientists develop anti-coronavirus inoculations.  While the United States pledged $2.5 billion to fight the disease, with more than $1 billion going towards developing a vaccine.  Scientists at Greffex, a Houston, Texas-based genetic engineering company, claim they've created a coronavirus vaccine.  The company told the Houston Business Journal that it had completed development of the vaccine and it is ready for animal testing and review by US regulators.  It comes after UK scientists announced they'd begun testing their shot, and researchers at the University of Texas at Austin announced they'd made compound they believe can serve as a vaccine.

Bozell explained just how wasteful that money is and what $75 million could do if put to actually FIGHTING the spread of the virus. He declared, “Now more than ever, Americans must pull together in a spirit of unity. Not in the spirit of division that CPB has advocated through its decades of biased programming.”  Here is Bozell's full letter to the President:   Dear Mr. President,  As you are aware, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) received a $75 million grant from the Federal Government as a part of the CARES Act. We believe that was misguided. Just as Amazon, Microsoft, Ford Motor Corporation, and Starbucks have given so generously to help in the fight against COVID-19, so should the CPB give.  The CARES Act is already law and the money the government issued to the CPB is unlikely to be returned. Regardless, it is worth noting what this money could have been spent on instead. Seventy-five million dollars could have purchased:  300,000 Covid-19 test kits or,   4,166 ventilators or,   21,428 hospital beds or,   192,307,692 masks or,  357,483,318 pairs of medical gloves or,  12,500,000 bottles of hand sanitizer  At this point in our country’s history, all of these things are infinitely better uses of taxpayer money than giving it to left-wing outlets like NPR and PBS, both of which attack you and your administration continuously. According to CPB’s own website, it already has a bloated annual budget of $445 million. As you have appropriately called for yet again this year, federal funding for CPB should be completely eliminated. As with any other private entity in a free society, the CPB should have to compete in the free market to convince consumers that its programming is worth their financial support.  Anything else is legalized plunder.  The CPB produces programs promoting values which many Americans just don’t agree with. The federal government, by funding CPB, is forcing Americans to support values they oppose.  What could be more antithetical to a free society?  That is why your proposal to eliminate all federal funding for CPB is completely justified. There will undoubtedly be proposals for more stimulus packages going forward. When that happens, we encourage you to push back hard against funding for such entities as CPB. No amount of classical music, Ken Burns documentaries, or “Morning Editions” is worth one saved human life.  Ideally, CPB’s board would do the patriotic thing and voluntarily return this money. But as that is unlikely to happen, the next best thing would be to oppose such gratuitous grants when they are proposed in the future. You can count on our support and the millions of Americans who support the principles of the free market.  Now more than ever, Americans must pull together in a spirit of unity. Not in the spirit of division that CPB has advocated through its decades of biased programming.   Sincerely,   L.

On Tuesday, Santa Clara County Public Health officials announced that an autopsy revealed a patient died of the virus, which originated in China, on February 6, roughly three weeks prior to the first U.S. confirmed COVID-19 death in Washington state on February 29.  The first coronavirus death in Santa Clara County was initially marked on March 9. As of this writing, the county has 88 coronavirus-related deaths with another 1,948 reported cases.  “The Medical Examiner-Coroner performed autopsies on two individuals who died at home on February 6, 2020 and February 17, 2020,” the announcement said. “Samples from the two individuals were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Today, the Medical Examiner-Coroner received confirmation from the CDC that tissue samples from both cases are positive for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). ”  The announcement did not indicate if the patients were elderly or had a pre-existing condition, noting only that “limited testing was available only through the CDC” while anticipating that more COVID-19 deaths will be identified throughout the county that were once previously unconfirmed cases.  “Testing criteria set by the CDC at the time restricted testing to only individuals with a known travel history and who sought medical care for specific symptoms,” the announcement continued. “As the Medical Examiner-Coroner continues to carefully investigate deaths throughout the county, we anticipate additional deaths from COVID-19 will be identified.”  Speaking with Mercury News, County Executive Jeff Smith said the autopsy proves that the virus has been in California for a while – since as early as January.  “We know there was a person diagnosed in late January with the virus — but to have at least three people right around the beginning of February and late January already have the infection and two of them pass away means the virus has been around for a while,” Smith said.  Furthermore, these cases are believed to have originated in the community.  “It’s a much more dangerous virus than we initially recognized because we had limited testing,” Smith said.  Sara Cody, a public health officer with Santa Clara County, told the county’s Board of Supervisors on Tuesday that COVID-19 will see a number of surges for months or even years.  “COVID-19 is something we’re going to be managing for a very long time, months and likely years,” Cody said. “We anticipate this won’t be the only surge, we’ll have other surges that will likely come if we let up too much so we have to be extra careful to develop the information systems to enable us to monitor what we’re doing.”  Though the methodologies were called into question, a recent anti-body test study by Stanford University showed that the coronavirus cases in Santa Clara County were 50 to 85 times higher than officials initially speculated.  “At the time of the study, Santa Clara County had 1,094 confirmed cases of COVID-19, resulting in 50 deaths,” reported The Guardian. “But based on the rate of participants who have antibodies, the study estimates it is likely that between 48,000 and 81,000 people had been infected in Santa Clara county by early April.”  “That also means coronavirus is potentially much less deadly to the overall population than initially thought,” it continued. “As of Tuesday, the US’s coronavirus death rate was 4.1% and Stanford researchers said their findings show a death rate of just 0.12% to 0.2%.”  The Daily Wire, headed by bestselling author and popular podcast host Ben Shapiro, is a leading provider of conservative news, cutting through the mainstream media’s rhetoric to provide readers the most important, relevant, and engaging stories of the day.

Which is why it is painfully ironic that the same nation that indirectly helped Vietnam become a prominent player in global trade, now appears set to cripple Vietnam's fledgling export powerhouse. The culprit? Covid-19.  With China's economy grinding to a halt as tens of thousands of people are infected and hundreds of millions are under quarantine from the coronavirus pandemic, a new viral hub may be emerging near Vietnam's capital, Hanoi.  According to the Bangkok Post, villages in Vietnam with 10,000 people close to the nation's capital were placed under quarantine on Thursday after six cases of the deadly new coronavirus were discovered there, authorities said.  The locking down of the commune of Son Loi, about 40 kilometres from Hanoi, is the first mass quarantine outside of China since the virus emerged from Wuhan.  \"As of February 13, 2020, we will urgently implement the task of isolation and quarantine of the epidemic area in Son Loi commune,\" said a health ministry statement. \"The timeline... is for 20 days\".  Vietnamese police stand guard at a checkpoint set up at the Son Loi commune in Vinh Phuc province amid concerns about a Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak.  The health ministry previously said five people in Son Loi - which is a farming region made up of several villages - had been infected with the virus, and on Thursday reported a sixth case. At that time, checkpoints were set up around the commune, in Binh Xuyen, a district on the outskirts of Son Loi, according to AFP reporters .  Health officials wearing protective suits sprayed disinfectant on vehicles by the checkpoints.  Even ahead of the quarantine, local resident Tran Van Minh told AFP that authorities had already advised residents to avoid large gatherings. \"Life has been badly affected,\" he told AFP by phone, adding that much of the labor force is reliant on jobs in construction and house painting.  \"Now we cannot get out and even if we do, clients don't welcome us that much as before.\"  If this is a harbinger of things to come, very soon all of Vietnam may be under lockdown. Recall that China has imposed unprecedented quarantines across Hubei and the entire country, locking in several hundred million people, in a bid to stop it spreading. Tens of millions of residents in cities far from the epicentre are also enduring travel restrictions.  The virus has also had massive ramifications globally, with many countries banning travellers from China in a bid to stop people spreading the disease.  Vietnam, which shares a porous border with China, has 16 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, including those in Son Loi.  In a bid to stop the virus from spreading, Vietnam had banned all flights to and from mainland China and has also suspended new tourist visas for Chinese nationals or foreigners who had been in China over the past two weeks. It remains to be seen if it will be enough.

With more than 53,000 dead, the threat has never been more stark. Experts warn the more than one million cases of Covid-19 confirmed globally are probably just a small proportion of total infections, as testing is not widely available.  Prosperous countries in Europe and North America are currently bearing the brunt of the disease but — with infections also reported in war zones and refugee camps — there are fears of a new explosion among the world’s most vulnerable.  “The worst is yet to come,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, referring to countries beset with fighting like Syria, Libya and Yemen. “The Covid-19 storm is now coming to all these theatres of conflict.”  UN chief says the worst is yet to come, referring to conflict-hit countries like Syria, Libya and Yemen  For the moment, the United States accounts for around a quarter of confirmed cases, but Europe is far from being out of danger — Spain reported more than 900 deaths in 24 hours on Friday, for the second day running.  While Italy still leads the world in fatalities, France, Belgium and Britain have also been hard hit. The UK government opened a 4,000-bed field hospital on Friday ahead of announcing its highest one-day toll of 684.  UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is himself entering a second week of isolation with high temperature after testing positive for the virus, but Queen Elizabeth is to make an historic address to Britain and the Commonwealth nations on Sunday.  The public health battle being waged across the world ebbed and flowed, with Germany saying the rate of new infections is slowing but once confident Singapore closing schools and workplaces to fend off a possible renewed upsurge in cases.  ‘Worst moment of my life’  The virus has now killed more than 10,000 people across Spain, but it spared 29-year-old Javier Lara, who has returned home after being treated in an overburdened intensive care unit.

Five policemen, who tried to intervene, were also assaulted.  According to the police, the incident took place at Ashiyana Apartment, an affordable housing colony in Sector 62 of Ballabhgarh. The suspects have been identified as Ird Khan alias Pappu, Shekhawat, Hafiz, Jalalu and Nafis. All the suspects are neighbours, police said.  A case was registered under sections 148 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), at Adarsh Nagar police station. The suspects were produced before a district magistrate on Tuesday evening and sent to jail in judicial custody for 14 days.  The victim was identified as Rekha Sharma, a resident of Sector 65 in Faridabad, who has been working as an ASHA worker in Ballabhgarh for the past six years. On Tuesday, she said, she reached Ashiyana society around 1pm for conducting a surveillance. “I had to take details from each house during the door-to-door survey. When I asked one of the families to share the details of the number of members and if anyone had shown any kind of symptoms related to Covid, they refused to cooperate. I am also supposed to ask if anyone, who might have attended Jamaat in Delhi’s Nizamuddin, had visited their house or met them. But they got furious after ia sked them that and started abusing me,” she said.  Sharma immediately informed her senior medical officers, who were near the spot. They in turn informed the police control room and the nearest police station. “The group started using vulgar language and abused the administration. They fished out wooden sticks and iron rods from inside their home and threatened to take us hostage. Within 10 minutes, a police team from Adarsh Nagar arrived and tried to intervene but they attacked all of us with sticks and rods ,” she said.  Kailash Chander, station house officer of Adarsh Police station, said that a team of 10 policemen had reached the spot and they had tried to pacify the residents. But some of them turned violent. “We called for backup to control the situation, as the suspects had called their neighbours and more than 20 people had gathered at the spot,” he said.  Sharma and two police personnel sustained injuries on their head, arms, shoulders, and legs in the incident, and were taken to a private hospital.  ASHA workers have been deployed by the district administration to conduct door-to-door survey in all the residential areas and collect data on people having cough, cold and fever symptoms. They act as a bridge between the community and the public healthcare system in India and since mid-March, they have been conducting surveys to gather information about those who are likely to be affected by Covid-19 in the state.  KK Rao, Faridabad’s commissioner of police, said that they often receive complaints from these ASHA workers. “We have informed all station house officers to take strict action against those who misbehave with ASHA workers or medical teams,” he said.  Faridabad deputy commissioner Yashpal Yadav also said that the health department and ASHA workers are facing regular harassment during these surveys. “We have requested police commissioner to act against anyone found abusing these workers or refusing to cooperate with them,” he said.

The infectiousness of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the COVID-19 disease currently overwhelming the global medical system was initially assessed at 2.2, meaning that without social distancing a person with the disease would infect slightly more than two others. The seasonal flu, by comparison, has an infectious rate of about 1.28.  Why does the infectious rate matter? The more infectious a virus, the more drastic the steps a society must take, absent a vaccine, to keep the virus from spreading. A drastically higher infectious rate, as indicated in the study released Wednesday, could mean the U.S. economy would have to be shut down significantly longer to prevent a second wave of the pandemic. And some economists are already suggesting that unless a semblance of normal economic activity resumes by May, the U.S. economy will nosedive into a depression.  The more doctors and scientists have studied SARS-CoV-2, the higher the estimated rate of infection has climbed. In February, studied abstracted on the World Health Organization’s site estimated an infectious rate of 2.2. A March 30 paper by mathematicians and doctors at the Imperial College of London indicated the infectious rate -- a metric known to epidemiologists as “R-naught” or “R0” -- is actually 3.87.  Both of those numbers, however, pale in comparison to the study published Wednesday on the “Emerging Infectious Diseases\" site of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which concluded the actual rate of infection is about 5.7. In statistical terms, they have 95 percent statistical confidence that the disease’s actual reproduction rate falls between 3.8 on the low end, and a stunning 8.9 on the high end.  The analysis, titled “High Contagiousness and Rapid Spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2,” immediately caught the attention of high-profile disease experts such as Eric Feigl-Ding of Harvard Medical School. He called it “a considerably different level of infectiousness.”  “Wowzers,” he tweeted. “This much higher SARSCoV2 RO value carries a lot of implications for vaccines, treatments, and containment measures needed.”  According to Fiegl-Ding, an infectious rate of 2.2 would mean that once 55 percent of the population had achieved immunity, either by receiving a vaccine or contracting the actual disease, the disease would naturally fade out.  But when you increase the infectiousness to 5.7, fully 85 percent of the population would require immunity before officials could rest assured a second wave of the disease would not follow the relaxation of social-distancing restrictions.  According to the Los Alamos study, a structural analysis of the virus “suggests SARS-CoV-2 has a much higher affinity to the receptor needed for cell entry than the 2003 SARS virus, providing a molecular basis for the high infectiousness.”  The study adds that “quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic persons can be effective when the fraction of unidentified persons is low. However, when 20 percent of transmission is driven by unidentified infected, high levels of social distancing efforts will be needed.”  A massive testing program in Iceland recently found that up to half of coronavirus victims either have no symptoms – meaning they are asymptomatic but may still transmit the disease -- or they assumed their symptoms were caused by something else.  The combination of much higher infectiousness than previously realized, combined with the asymptomatic tendency of the disease, means reopening society could be much more difficult until adequate vaccines are developed, which may not arrive until this fall.  It’s important to realize, however, that the infectiousness of the virus isn’t static. Weather and environment can push the number up or down. Also, as people become aware of a particular virus, they’re more likely to have themselves tested, treated, and quarantined before infecting others. Thus, social distancing also reduces infectiousness.

Despite a few initial hiccups in the system they set up for PPP causing applications to be delayed by a week, they were still able to submit and fund their clients during the first round. We’re a small startup (small PPP loan). and received our notice of SBA acceptance the day the first round ran out, and received our wire last week.  A few minutes ago SVB announced they are donating all fees from CARES to COVID-19 relief efforts.  It would be great to see other big banks do the same.  Full e-mail from the CEO below:   To Our Clients:  Last Thursday, we announced our Q1 2020 earnings and held our annual shareholder meeting. Following these events, I am reflecting on the changes we have all experienced since just the beginning of this year and wanted to share with you the status of some of our relief efforts and reinforce our commitment to doing everything we can to increase your probability of success. In good times and in challenging times, this is our mission.  Like you, we are moved by heart-wrenching hardships impacting companies and communities worldwide. We are inspired by the brave people who show up every day to provide us all essential services. SVB considers it our responsibility to support them and the larger community as well as we possibly can during this exceptionally tough time. None of our debt relief or community support efforts would be possible without our solid financial foundation, which allows us to invest in our business, offer immediate relief to clients and respond in robust ways to community needs.  Our long history of working with high-growth companies and their investors, private equity firms, premium wineries and private banking clients positions us well to help navigate adversity and help our clients manage successfully through this difficult time. Together, we are making a difference. There are SVB clients that are developing vaccines, contact tracing methods and faster healthcare delivery models. Our employees and locally-funded charities are helping students and seniors adapt to lockdowns and getting healthcare providers access to life-saving equipment and nourishment.  Consistent with our long tradition of supporting and giving back to our communities, we initially committed $5.5 million to local, regional and global COVID-19 relief activities in the eight countries and 15 states where we have offices. We just announced that we will also donate all net fees we receive from the US CARES Act Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to support pandemic relief efforts.  I want to share with you some of the highlights of our COVID-19 Response & Community Support Initiatives to date:  SVB Debt ReliefOur teams have worked with many of our clients to find some funding and payment relief to support their challenging situations. Since the beginning of April, our venture debt principal deferral program has enabled more than 1,000 startups to defer their principal payments for six months on loans of $10 million or less for a combined $2.1 billion in funded debt. The Premium Wine Division is enabling a majority of clients to defer principal payments for three to six months, and we have created a wine gifting program to support wine sales. In addition, SVB Private Bank clients have also been given the option to defer mortgage payments for 90 days.  Government ReliefSVB is actively working with industry groups and government leaders in the US, UK and other nations to help design and implement small-business economic relief programs to create stability and then prepare for recovery. In the first round of the PPP, SVB received more than 5,500 applications, of which more than 3,600 were processed through SBA’s online system, representing approximately $2.2 billion in relief, as of April 16. We will continue to support this program given new fund availability and will process as many previously received applications as possible. We continue to review other government programs for client eligibility.  Additional Startup and Small Business ResourcesSVB is supporting emergency small business grants of $10,000 each for qualified applicants through Hello Alice’s Business for All initiative. Hello Alice hosts a free COVID-19 Business Resource Center that is focused on linking women- and minority-owned businesses to relief programs, funding opportunities, mentors and other support programs. To learn more and apply for emergency grants, go to www.covid19businesscenter.com.  Engaging Community SupportWe have identified three primary focus areas for our philanthropic efforts: health, food security and shelter, and small business relief. The $5.5 million we committed to COVID-19 charitable relief initiatives, was accomplished through corporate contributions to global and national or regional charities, direct community-based giving and a 3:1 match for employees’ donations to relevant causes in their local area. We will expand donations with the net PPP loan origination fees we receive from the SBA program when they become available.  In partnership with Founders Pledge, SVB also developed the COVID-19 Global Impact & Innovation Fund, which we seeded with a $1 million contribution. The goal of the fund is to identify and consolidate into a single fund, high-impact organizations that are now focused on activities to help slow COVID-19’s spread and provide immediate relief to those affected. The fund is open for donations from the public.  Supporting Our EmployeesWe hear from our clients every day that our employees are our greatest asset. I agree. Their resilience and perseverance during this crisis has been remarkable. We know if we take care of our employees, only then can they take care of you. SVB is supporting our employees and their families with health, well-being and financial support programs. Our employees are pulling together to serve you.  For updates on SVB COVID-19 Response & Community Support efforts, please visit www.svb.com/covid-relief.  For more than 35 years, SVB has supported our clients through up and down cycles.

The outbreak of the coronavirus has led to a nationwide lockdown in Italy as the government is seeking to slow down its spread. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. (AP Photo/Luca Bruno)  (AP) — Sweeping travel bans accelerated around the globe Thursday, walling regions apart, keeping people inside their homes and slowing the engines of commerce to try to stem the unfolding coronavirus pandemic.  President Donald Trump, who had downplayed the virus for weeks, suddenly struck a different tone, delivering a somber Oval Office address announcing strict rules on travel from much of Europe to begin this weekend. The State Department followed with an extraordinary warning to Americans to “reconsider travel abroad” as well.  The European Union quickly slammed Trump’s “unilateral” decision, declaring the virus a “global crisis, not limited to any continent and it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action.”  The virus detected three months ago in China has produced crippling outbreaks in Asia, Europe and the Middle East, ignited global financial panic and in the last week has seen dizzying developments that are erupting by the hour.  Those include an official designation of “pandemic” from the World Health Organization, a dramatic halt to much travel between the United States and 26 European countries, and infections being announced in rapid-fire pace by Hollywood celebrities, sports stars and political leaders as well as ordinary folks on cruise ships.  “It’s similar to what you might think of as an infectious disease equivalent of a major earthquake that’s going to shake us for weeks and weeks,” said Dr. Jeff Duchin a top public health official for the Seattle area, which has one of the biggest U.S. coronavirus outbreaks.  Around the world, nursing homes emptied of visitors to protect the elderly, who are especially vulnerable to the virus.  More than 126,000 people in more than 110 countries have been infected. The vast majority are in just four countries: China and South Korea — where new cases are declining —and Iran and Italy, where they are not. More than 4,600 people have died worldwide.  In California, the governor advised officials to cancel any gatherings of more than 250 people, as well as any smaller meetings where people must be closer than 6 feet (2 meters) — a description that includes everything from dinner parties to political rallies.  In Italy, the center of Europe’s epidemic, new restrictions closed restaurants, cafes and retail shops Thursday after the prime minister imposed a nationwide lockdown on personal movement earlier in the week. Grocery stores, pharmacies and outdoor markets were allowed to operate, as were newspaper stands.  Rosanna Farina, whose family has run a newspaper kiosk in Rome’s historic center since the 19th century, was torn on whether it was worth staying open.  “So few people are out and about. People are terrorized,” she said, wearing a scarf around her face. “I’d rather be home. I’m worried, even if I’m keeping a distance.”  Ireland joined the growing list of countries shutting down their school systems, and Europe’s most successful soccer team, Real Madrid, put all its players into quarantine after one tested positive.  Even remote Mount Everest closed for business. Chinese mountaineering officials canceled spring climbs from their side of the mountain, while on the other side in Nepal, operators say cancellations were pouring in.  Europeans were adjusting to the American travel restrictions, which hit some of the world’s most heavily traveled routes and threw travel plans into chaos.  “We were going to get married in Las Vegas, with Elvis. It was going to be epic,” said Sandrine Reynaert, a Parisian who had to cancel the April 20 ceremony. Her future husband already has the date engraved in his ring.  Now Reynaert was cancelling each step of the trip that, as well as Las Vegas, also would have taken them to other iconic spots of Americana: Route 66, Joshua Tree National Park and the Grand Canyon.  Britain and Ireland were exempt, despite imposing far fewer restrictions in response to the virus than many EU countries, raising questions about the coherence of the U.S. policy. Trump has properties in both nations.  Trump accused Europe of not acting quickly enough to address the “foreign virus” and claimed that U.S. clusters were “seeded” by European travelers.  Across the U.S., where cases now number more than 1,300, a sense of urgency was pervasive.  Schools emptied of students and workplace cubicles went vacant. A rite of spring, college basketball’s NCAA tournament, was to be played in empty arenas, while in the NBA decided their pros won’t play at all for now. Joyous, booze-filled, green-splashed celebrations of St. Patrick’s Day were called off across the U.S. and Ireland. TV shows taped without audiences, rush-hour crowds in New York subway cars disappeared and families hunkered down, wondering what would come next.  “If we avoid each other and listen to the scientists, maybe in a few weeks it will be better,” said Koloud “Kay” Tarapolsi of Redmond, Washington, who has two children whose schools closed Thursday.  As the pandemic grips Europe and the U.S., it continues to ebb in China, where the first cases of COVID-19 emerged in December. It reported a record low of just 15 new cases Thursday. So far more than three-fourths of China’s patients have recovered.  Most people infected by the new virus have only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, though symptoms can be severe, including pneumonia, especially in older adults and people with existing health problems. Recovery for mild cases takes about two weeks, while more severe illness may take three to six weeks, according to the WHO.  Research published Wednesday found that the coronavirus can live in the air for several hours, and for as long as two to three days on some surfaces.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned her nation that, over time, two-thirds of the country could become infected since people do not have immunity to COVID-19.  “We have called every day for countries to take urgent and aggressive action,” said WHO’s leader, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “We have rung the alarm bell loud and clear.”  Double Oscar winner Tom Hanks said he and his wife Rita Wilson tested positive. Australian officials say the couple are in a Queensland hospital and their close contacts need to self-quarantine.  In Italy, soccer club Juventus said defender Daniele Rugani tested positive. In Iran, the senior vice president and two other Cabinet ministers were reported to have been diagnosed with it. In Spain, the equality minister was diagnosed, and her husband, a deputy prime minister, was in quarantine.  In Greece, where the Olympic torch for the 2020 Tokyo Games was lit behind closed doors, there was an urgent call from the government for more doctors and nurses.  “The time of the battle has come,” Health Minister Vassilis Kikilias said on live television. “The battle will be determined by how we respond as citizens.”  European and Asian markets plunged Thursday, following a drop of 1,464 points of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, putting the index 20% below its record set last month and into fearsome territory Wall Street calls a “bear market.”  “There’s a real feeling that we don’t know where this ends,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network.  For 83-year-old Natalina De Santis, fear of germs has led her to forgo all visits from her three adult children. She insists they leave care packages outside the door of her home in Rome, then goes to the balcony to wave.  “If I get sick, what would my children do?” she said in a telephone interview. “They’d have to come, they won’t be able to leave me alone. So, to avoid all this, I stay in my home.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 11, "positive": 30, "negative": 14, "sadness": 2, "disgust": 1, "joy": 3, "anger": 12, "surprise": 4, "fear": 13, "trust": 11}, "metadata": ["italy", "outbreak", "coronavirus", "nationwide", "lockdown", "mild", "donald", "virus", "announcing", "strict", "americans", "european", "cooperation", "china", "global", "united", "sports", "cruise", "infectious", "nursing", "vulnerable", "korea", "iran", "gatherings", "retail", "shops", "minister", "quarantine", "chinese", "canceled", "las", "park", "britain", "trump", "students", "workplace", "college", "nba", "families", "children", "pandemic", "infected", "symptoms", "immunity", "hanks", "hospital", "diagnosed", "de", "germs"]}, {"text": "MADISON, CT — In addition to myriad preparations that are under way and set to begin, Madison Public Schools has canceled a school-sponsored trip to Europe that was set for April, all in response to the coronovirus outbreak.

There have been no confirmed cases in Connecticut yea, but surrounding states including New York, Rhode Island and Massachusetts have. Madison Public Schools are installing hand sanitizer dispensers, posters reminding students to wash their hands thoroughly and regularly are in all schools, all schools will be supplied additional hand sanitizer, \"custodians have been instructed to remain vigilant when cleaning high touch traffic points such as hand rails, light switches, lunch tables, and chair seats\" and staff will be given disposable wipes to wipe down Chromebooks and iPads between uses, among other measures.  Here's the full letter to families: Dear MPS Community,  As COVID-19 or Coronavirus continues to spread, I wanted to make our school community aware of the steps being taken by the administration to keep our students and staff safe and healthy. Our goal as a district is to keep our community as informed as possible and do our part to slow the spread of germs.  Right now, Madison Public Schools is working closely with the Madison Health Department, in particular, the local Director of Public Health, Trent Joseph, Madison Public Schools Nurse Supervisor Stephanie Lesnik, and our Medical Advisor Dr. Karen Goldberg. Our experts are currently encouraging anyone who did not get a flu shot this season to please get one now.  We rely on the expertise of the professionals in the field of public health to guide any necessary responses.

Sources said Entercom COO Susan Larkin had a conference call with WFAN staff Thursday morning in which she laid out that contracted employees, like Francesa, Esiason and Giannotti, who make $250,000 or more will be asked to take a 20 percent pay cut.  Those in the $100,000 to $250,000 range will be requested to accept a 15 percent reduction.  Those in the $50,000 to $100,000 range will be asked to take a 10 percent cut.  Entercom CEO David Field said he would be taking a 30 percent cut in a memo first reported by the site Radio & Television Business Report.  Those without contracts will have no choice but to accept the new financial stipulations. Those with contracts could decline or negotiate new terms.  On Thursday afternoon, longtime update man, John Minko, a FAN original from 1987, announced on Francesa’s Radio.com show that he has taken a buyout. Friday will be his final day. The 67-year-old known as the “Mink Man” has been a part of the fabric of the station’s sound throughout its more than three decades.  Esiason, for one, told The Post he will help out Entercom.  “I’m willing to sacrifice for the betterment of everybody,” Esiason told The Post.  Esiason indicated the whole “Morning Show with Boomer & Gio” crew would stay intact and not be impacted by the dismissals.  Besides the furloughs, FAN will have layoffs. Entercom laid off hosts at other stations Thursday, but it is not known if anyone in New York will be a part of them. The reduction that Entercom plans to enact would be in effect, at this point, until July 23.   Entercom declined comment.  In other news, Francesa seemed as if he were attempting to shut down the Twitter account, @BackAftaThis, which is famous for replaying clips of his program. Francesa said that if anyone publishes audio or video from his show they will need express written consent of FAN/Entercom.  Francesa said they would be hearing from the company’s lawyers, if not.

We will remain supportive and flexible, which may affect individual paper processing times (more below). We are also carefully monitoring the health and well-being of our staff, managing and coordinating workloads, and supporting each other with flexibility. While the situation is far from normal in both of our primary locations (USA and UK), at this point we do not anticipate issues preventing the efficient publishing of our seven journals. We are facilitating the prompt evaluation of any papers related to the coronavirus and resulting pandemic, and all other papers are also being handled as per our standard processes.  Reassurance for Our Research Communities  We understand that the global research community is significantly but also variably affected by this pandemic, and so we want to provide the following clarifications and reassurance:   To Authors  We are flexible regarding turnaround times for revisions and other tasks during this stressful time.

(Arkansas Democrat-Gazette/Staton Breidenthal)  Gov. Asa Hutchinson unveiled projections Friday showing the number of coronavirus cases in Arkansas is expected to hit 3,500 in two weeks.  The state's first covid-19 diagnosis was March 11. On Friday evening, the state reported 386 cases, an increase of 37 from the day before.  The two-week projection by researchers at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences' College of Public Health was based on the current trajectory and didn't show when the cases will peak.  Hutchinson said the longer-term estimates \"range wildly based on the information that is put into those models.\"  [CORONAVIRUS: Click here for our complete coverage » arkansasonline.com/coronavirus]  But he said the state is taking steps to prepare for what some studies indicate will be more than 10,000 patients needing hospital care at one time within a few months.  \"It's too early to tell\" what the peak demand for hospital space will be, the Republican governor said.  \"We look at the data every day and make our best judgment as to where we're going in the future, but we have to plan further down the road, whether it's ventilators or hospital beds.  \"We have to plan for that worst-case scenario because we're committed not to have our health care professionals have to make difficult choices.

Health Department Secretary Nate Smith said it's hard to know how many the state will need. In some other areas, he said, 40%-50% of hospitalized patients have needed ventilators.  [Gallery not loading above? Click here for more photos » arkansasonline.com/328covidupdate/]  If that holds true for Arkansas, the state will need more.  As of Friday afternoon, 17 covid-19 patients were on ventilators, up from 13 a day earlier.  President Donald Trump issued an order Friday seeking to force General Motors Co. to produce ventilators, a move that Smith said \"bodes well for us\" depending on how soon the automaker can ramp up production.  \"In contrast to New York, where they're going to need stuff in the next couple of weeks, we need stuff in the next couple of months,\" Smith said.  [Interactive Arkansas map not showing up above? Click here to see it: arkansasonline.com/arvirus]  Attorney General Leslie Rutledge also announced Friday that she had allocated $1 million in lawsuit settlement proceeds to provide respirators, masks and other protective gear for health care providers.   SITES EXAMINED  The governor said he had authorized 10 members of the Arkansas National Guard to provide engineering and architectural support to the Health Department and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as they explore options for increasing the state's hospital capacity.  Corps spokesman Randall Townsend said sites ranging from War Memorial Stadium to hotels might be used as temporary hospitals or just an area for those who don't have a place to stay during the pandemic.  The Hot Springs Convention Center is one of the sites under consideration, Visit Hot Springs CEO Steve Arrison said.  He said the convention center, which has been closed to the public since March 17, was contacted by the National Guard about the possibility of setting up hospital beds there. Guard personnel plan to visit next week, he said.  \"I think they're looking at various other facilities around the state,\" Arrison said. \"So, if that's the case, we'll be ready to do whatever we have to do to get Hot Springs and Arkansas through this crisis.\"  Townsend said the Corps already has pre-planned designs for different sites and the teams will try to find the best buildings or facilities that can implement those designs. He said the state will make the final decision on which ones are used.   HOSPITAL BEDS  On Friday afternoon, 48 of the Arkansans diagnosed with covid-19 were hospitalized, or just over 12% of the total. That was up from 41 a day earlier.  Even if 700 -- 20% -- of the 3,500 people with the virus need hospital care in two weeks, the state's hospitals could easily accommodate them, Smith said.  \"My concern is where are we going to be in four weeks, six weeks and eight weeks,\" he said.  A report by the Arkansas Hospital Association, using a model created by the Harvard School of Public Health and Harvard Global Health Institute, estimates that, under a \"moderate\" scenario, 12,720 Arkansans will need hospital care, including 2,760 in intensive care, at the peak of the pandemic in the state, which it projects happening in June.  On the other hand, a University of Washington study predicts a peak of 2,183 hospital patients, including 328 in intensive care, happening toward the end of April.  \"If I was confident that the [University of Washington] model was absolutely the course that we were on, we really wouldn't need to do much of anything,\" to expand hospital capacity, Smith said.  But he said the state won't know which projection is more accurate until late April or early May.  In the meantime, he said he hopes to build the state's hospital capacity by about 2,000 beds over the next four or five weeks.  \"That would get us halfway to [the needed space for] our worst-case scenario and still leave us time to try to make it the rest of the way,\" he said.  Among the options officials are considering is increasing staff in hospitals with unused space, reopening shuttered hospitals, converting buildings into hospitals and setting up temporary tent hospitals in places such as War Memorial Stadium.  \"I'm not saying that's my first choice, but if we need it, that's not a bad place to put a mobile hospital,\" Smith said.  Using existing hospital space would be preferable, but ultimately the choice will be \"probably whatever we can do quickest,\" he said.  Of the state's 10,000 hospital beds, he said, only about 6,500 were staffed on Friday, and 4,200 of those had patients.  Hospitals in rural areas, in particular, tend to have lower occupancy and more room to take in patients.  The state had 340 available intensive-care beds, far fewer than the 2,760 that the hospital association study predicts the state will need.  But Smith said, \"It's not that hard to upgrade an acute-care bed to an ICU bed, or at least a ventilated bed.\"  \"It's harder to take a non-hospital room and make it into a hospital room,\" he said   ENFORCING RESTRICTIONS  A week ago, Hutchinson predicted the pandemic would reach its peak in the state in early May, requiring 1,000 Arkansans to be hospitalized.  The governor said Friday that could still happen if the state's efforts to limit the spread of the virus are successful.  He said he spoke with law enforcement officials from across the state on Friday to ask for their help in enforcing his executive order prohibiting social gatherings of more than 10 people.  Violation of the governor's order on meetings is a misdemeanor punishable by up to a month in jail or a fine of up to $500.  Arkansas State Police Col. Bill Bryant said police will seek \"voluntary compliance\" whenever possible.  \"Hopefully we won't have to use the enforcement component,\" he said. \"Being necessary, we will.\"  Other measures by the state have included closing public schools through at least April 17, and closing bars, restaurants dining rooms, fitness clubs and hair salons, among other businesses.  Hutchinson also has recommended that businesses have employees work from home to the extent possible; screen employees and visitors for symptoms; and \"enforce social distancing,\" a concept that health officials have said includes staying at least 6 feet away from other people.  \"Every person in Arkansas needs to have the same level of concern,\" he said.   'WAKE-UP CALL'  So far, three Arkansans have died from the virus. No new deaths were announced Friday.  Rhonda Henderson Mullins of the Memphis area said in a Facebook post Thursday that her father's death should be a \"wake-up call.\"  Terry Henderson, 73, died Wednesday evening at Baptist Health Medical Center in Little Rock, Mullins said.  His death was the second among the members of Greers Ferry Assembly of God Church, coming after the death Tuesday of Bill Barton, a 91-year-old member of the church who was a door greeter there.  In the Facebook post, Mullins said her father thought he had the flu and \"that he would just fight through it\" as he's done before, and refused to see a doctor until his pastor tested positive for the virus.  Terry Henderson's wife also had the virus, but is recovering and will be released from the hospital in the near future, Mullins said.  Mullins posted the information about her father because she wanted others to know the danger of the virus.  \"Please don't let his death be in vain,\" she wrote.  The Pulaski County coroner's office identified the first person in the state who died from the virus as Brian Dill Sr., 59, of Sherwood.  Dill died at 4 a.m. Tuesday at Baptist Health Medical Center in North Little Rock.   43 OF 75 COUNTIES  The virus emerged late last year in Wuhan, China, and spreads through respiratory droplets emitted when people sneeze or cough. Symptoms -- fever, cough and shortness of breath -- have been mild for many people. Studies have indicated that the virus can live for days on surfaces.  The elderly and people with chronic health conditions are considered most at risk of severe illness, including pneumonia.  As of Friday evening, the virus had spread to 43 of the state's 75 counties, including the first case ever reported in Baxter County.  Compared with the totals from the previous evening, the cases had increased by six, to 89, in Pulaski County; by three, to 49, in Cleburne County; by four, to 28, in Faulkner County; by one, to 24, in Benton County; by one to 20, in Garland County; by two, to 17 in Clark County; by four, to 17, in Van Buren County; by one, to 13, in Washington County; by five, to 12, in Crittenden County; and by one, to six, in Lincoln County.  The totals remained unchanged in Jefferson County, which had 23 cases, and White County, which had six.  All other counties with cases were listed as having fewer than five cases.  Smith said those who had tested positive as of Friday afternoon included 15 children or teenagers age 18 or younger; 124 people age 65 or older; and 242 people 19-64. The total number of positives was later updated Friday, but no breakdown was given.  Twenty-three Arkansans who tested positive were listed as having recovered, meaning that at least a week has passed since they fell ill and that they haven't had symptoms for at least three days.

But standing in the Rose Garden, Birx also mentioned another model, created independently, that “ended up at the same numbers.” That analysis, which is publicly available, paints a grim picture of what’s to come in the US, even with social distancing in place.  As of Monday morning, it estimates that more than 2,000 people could die each day in the United States in mid-April, when the virus is predicted to hit the country hardest. The model, which is updated regularly, predicts that 224,000 hospital beds — 61,000 more than we’ll have — will be needed on April 15, when the US is estimated to reach “peak resource use.”  And assuming social distancing will continue through May, it finds that, by August, around 82,000 people in the US could die from Covid-19.  Birx, pointing to the model on Sunday, said “you can see the concern that we had with the growing number of potential fatalities.”  The analysis relies on data from Italy, China and the United States, using past experiences to predict the future.  Like many models, the projections are imperfect, but the researchers behind the project still came to an unsettling conclusion: “Even with social distancing measures enacted and sustained, the peak demand for hospital services due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely going to exceed capacity substantially.”   ‘An alarming number’  Designed by the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the model relies on information from state and national governments, hospital groups and the World Health Organization.  Birx, the White House health official, also mentioned the model to Chuck Todd on “Meet the Press” this weekend. “No state, no metro area will be spared,” she said during the interview.  State and local officials should quickly react to the coronavirus threat and enact social distancing measures, she said, so that “we’ll be able to move forward together and protect the most Americans.”  Deaths could be higher if states don’t enact those measures — or if people don’t follow them.  The model, for example, assumes that officials will limit social contact through May: closing schools, enacting stay-at-home measures, and limiting travel and non-essential business. For states that don’t implement at least three of the four measures, the model’s estimates for hospital usage and deaths will go up.  “Our estimate of 81 thousand deaths in the US over the next 4 months is an alarming number,” the researchers wrote, “but this number could be substantially higher if excess demand for health system resources is not addressed and if social distancing policies are not vigorously implemented and enforced across all states.”  The nation’s top infectious disease specialist, Dr. Anthony Fauci, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday that substantially more people could die: “Looking at what we’re seeing now, I would say that 100,000 and 200,000” deaths could occur.  “But I don’t want to be held to that,” said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He cautioned that modeling is imperfect, and said, “I just don’t think that we really need to make a projection when it’s such a moving target that you can so easily be wrong and mislead people.”   States face difference challenges  In places already hard-hit by the virus, such as New York, that date is predicted to come sooner. The state will need around 71,574 hospital beds on April 9, leading to a shortage of more than 58,564 beds, according to the model. New York will also need about 8,855 ventilators.  The state’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, thinks the reality could be more dire.  He has called for 30,000 ventilators in the state, and on Saturday, he said New York will need about 140,000 beds at the virus’s apex, which he forecasted to be 14 to 21 days away. Perhaps driven by those predictions, the governor has worked aggressively to build hospital capacity.  On Monday, a 1,000-bed hospital is set to open in a New York convention center, and Gov. Cuomo said on Saturday that Trump had approved four new emergency medical facilities in the state, providing 4,000 additional beds. The USNS Comfort, a naval hospital, also arrived this week, bringing 1,000 beds, which will be used for patients who don’t have Covid-19.  Other states are expected to need far fewer beds, according to the model. Florida, for example, won’t hit “peak resource use” until May 3. And while the state is projected to need almost 17,000 hospital beds at that time, it will have at least 20,000 available. More than 6,000 people there, however, are still predicted to die by August.  Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, has worked to limit community spread in the state, focusing his ire on New Yorkers and setting up checkpoints for travelers from the state. “The point is we need those folks coming in to self-isolate for 14 days,” DeSantis said on Saturday.  For weeks, though, DeSantis resisted calls to take aggressive action in Florida — refusing to close the state’s beaches, and choosing instead to limit gatherings there to 10 people.  Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, said in a Sunday tweet that “Florida is at risk of becoming major epicenter of epidemic spread of #COVID19 in the coming weeks.”  He added that “Miami appears to be a major hot spot. The outbreaks were apparent there weeks ago. And the state was slow to implement mitigation steps, and probably exported a lot of its infection.”  As more information becomes available, the IHME coronavirus model could change, and outlooks for states could worsen if mandated social distancing is not enacted and followed.  “Uncertainty in the time course of the epidemic, its duration, and the peak of utilization and deaths is large this early in the epidemic,” wrote the researchers who created the model. “Given this, it is critical to update these projections as new data on deaths in the US are collected.”  As of now, though, the model predicts that another large state, California, will face no shortage of intensive care beds at its peak. But Louisiana, a far smaller state, will need 700 more than it has.  The southern state is a budding coronavirus epicenter, having seen more than 180 deaths so far. California, which has 35 million more residents, has reported about 120 deaths.  While Louisiana is expected to be hit hardest on April 10, the model predicts that California’s peak will come about two weeks later, giving the state more time to prepare for a surge in cases.  Birx, the White House official, acknowledged last week that timelines would differ around the country, saying that “each state and each hotspot in the United States is going to be its own curve, because the seeds came in at different times.”  Models are imperfect, researchers say  The researchers behind the model caution that its predictions are imperfect.  They’re based in part on information from the US and Italy, but the model also uses data from Wuhan, China, where officials aggressively implemented four social distancing measures: closing schools, shuttering non-essential businesses, ordering residents to shelter-in-place and restricting travel.  Researchers assumed that just three of those measures — not all four — would be enough in the US to follow a trajectory similar to Wuhan. But “it is plausible that it requires all 4 measures,” wrote the researchers in a paper accompanying the data.  In the US, for example, states have yet to order legally binding travel bans. But many regions have closed schools, ordered businesses closed and told people to stay inside.  There are countries and places “who have done a little bit more than these three measurements,” said Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.  “They have shut down airports and they have canceled travel in and out of the country,” said Mokdad, who worked on the model.  Many restrictions in the US have been voluntary, too, without the aggressive enforcement seen in China. The researchers wrote that “it will take time to evaluate whether social distancing adherence is fundamentally different in the US compared to Wuhan.”  The model does take into account some differences between countries — such as how old a population is — but it doesn’t consider other factors that could impact how many people die during an epidemic. The prevalence of chronic lung disease, for example, could affect mortality rates.  The analysis predicts specific numbers, such as 82,000 deaths in the US through August, but it also provides a range of possibilities. It estimates that total deaths in the US as of August could be as low as 39,000 for example, or as high as 141,000.  Fauci, the infectious disease specialist, said on Sunday that “when someone creates a model, they put in various assumptions, and the model is only as good and as accurate as your assumptions.”  Those models “give a worst case scenario and a best case scenario,” he said. “Generally, the reality is somewhere in the middle.”  Things can still change, researchers say  One thing does seem certain: As demand for medical care skyrockets, hospitals have faced — and will continue to face — difficult choices. In New York, for example, one hospital system banned all visitors including partners during childbirth, before being overruled by the governor.  In Queens, a health care worker told CNN that there was an “every man for themselves” mentality when it came to protective equipment in the hospital.  And a letter from one Michigan hospital system — drafted for a potential worst-case scenario — described how care could be rationed: “Patients who have the best chance of getting better are our first priority.”  But things could still improve, especially in states that are still weeks away from their peaks.  Canceling elective procedures and encouraging people to only seek necessary care could free up hospitals, researchers said. Repurposing unused space — such as operating rooms, staff quarters and hallways — could temporarily increase bed capacity. And hospitals could bring on additional staff by increasing overtime, rehiring workers and using volunteers.  In New York, the nation’s coronavirus epicenter, about 1,000 people have already died after being infected. But Cuomo on Friday announced that more than 60,000 medical professionals — including retired practitioners — have already offered to volunteer their services. As many as 10,000 people signed up on one day last week.  Mokdad, the professor who worked on the model, underscored the importance of that spirit, in the United States and around the world. “This pandemic has shown clearly for all of us that we need to work together,” he said.  “There’s nothing positive about this virus destroying people and economies,” said Mokdad. “But I hope that we work together as countries from now on, instead of saying it’s China, it’s Iran, and so on. Otherwise, it will impact all of us. This is a lesson for all of us to come together and save lives.”  Click here for more coronavirus coverage.

A makeshift cardboard box hotel has been set up at Japan’s Narita International Airport for travelers from abroad who can’t find room in a government site as they await their coronavirus test results, according to reports.  The unsightly set-up in the airport’s baggage claim area is staffed by workers clad in protective gear who provide snacks and water, CNN reported.  People on local social media have criticized the arrangement, saying it could actually promote the spread of the deadly disease.  “They don’t do much testing in Japan, but many returnees from overseas are infected,” tweeted Misachasu, who also described the experience of his Vietnamese pal who spent a night in a cardboard cubicle.  “We consider this space a high risk of infection,” he wrote.  Though flights at the hub are down so sharply that it has closed one of its runways, planes are still arriving with passengers arriving from countries including the US and Italy who must undergo tests before they can go home.  The travelers may receive results as quickly as six hours, but delays mean many have to wait as long as one or two days, a Health Ministry official told Channel News Asia on condition of anonymity.  The cardboard boxes, which were developed for use in evacuation centers during disasters, contain a mattress and a quilt.  “There are facilities near the airport for people to stay, so as far as I know the beds haven’t been used yet – or if they have, it’s only been very briefly,” the official told the outlet.  Japan, which last week declared a state of emergency in major population areas, has recorded at least 7,400 cases from COVID-19, with 137 deaths, according to public broadcaster NHK.

In. Out. In. Out.  Five miles away, in a hospital bed in Rochester, New York, her father lay dying.  At first, his breaths were steady white noise that any other day would fade into the background.As the hours passed, his breathing became harder. Tortured. Heavy with mucus.  Reinhard – a mom, a wife and a daughter – spent the next day and a half listening to her father die, praying he could hear her voice. Moment by moment, she detailed those agonizing hours in a wrenching Facebook post.  The terror I’ve felt today is unlike anything I've ever experienced, and I can only imagine how hard it has been for you, Dad. I’m so sorry you are going through this nightmare.  Don Adair, 76, was a father of four and a grandfather of five. A retired attorney who doted on his family, he'd traveled with them to Europe, sat on the floor to open Christmas presents, grinned wide at their graduations and bounced them on his knee.  Now, he lay alone in a bed, isolated from other patients at Highland Hospital. He'd fallen at home a few days earlier, and hospital staffers were helping him fight a minor infection.  Not a problem, Reinhard thought at first. Her dad, her rock, never got sick.  Then he developed a fever and a cough – coronavirus.  Reinhard, 41, called her brother, Tom, in Texas. It was late on April 4. They wondered whether an asymptomatic patient in the hospital had passed along the infection. They talked about how the prognosis was good, how his symptoms were minor.  It's a conversation so many Americans are having, fretting late at night, consulting doctors and scouring the internet for signs of hope, looking at the statistics that say most people will never get really sick.  \"He was very strong, physically. I'm sure he'll be fine, is what I told myself,\" she said. \"We went to bed thinking, chances are he's going to be OK.\"  Her husband made the kids french toast. They watched online Palm Sunday services, in which the pastor urged them to approach uncertainty with faith, not with fear.  Then came the call. A Highland nurse said things Reinhard tried to understand: \"Aspiration ... deterioration ... suffering ... not much time.”  The nurse put the phone to Adair's ear. He couldn't talk, but he could listen.  Pacing in her bathroom, Reinhard struggled to catch her own breath, to hide her sobs from her three kids. To listen. To speak.  \"I love you,\" she said.   \"Thank you.\"   \"I'm sorry.\"   \"I forgive you.\"  You settled down in between coughs, and I searched my heart for what to say.  I talked about our precious times at the lake. I remembered you playing your guitar around the campfire, and I clung to that image as if it were my saving grace.  The lyrics of those old campfire songs seemed so fitting now– “Milk and honey on the other side” and “He’s got the whole world in his hands.”  Laundry overflowed the basket in the corner. She talked, listened, prayed. She felt like part of her was outside her own body. It was too much to take in.  After half an hour, she realized she could conference in her siblings – Tom, Carrie in North Carolina and Emily in Denmark. They stayed on the phone for hours, singing more campfire songs, telling stories, remembering their childhood.  Over the next many hours, our conversation with you is one I will treasure for the rest of my life. Although we were each sitting in Dallas, Raleigh, Copenhagen or Rochester, we were together, unpacking memories we had stored away long ago. The lake, the Cape, and our Europe trip. Games, projects and important conversations. We also sang more campfire songs. I pray that you could hear it all.  Contact tracing helped end the Ebola outbreak: Public health experts say it can stop COVID-19, too.  Fact check: Herd immunity would not fully stop the spread of coronavirus  America has suffered great loss before: Here's how we may learn to cope with coronavirus death toll.  Reinhard broke away from the call to talk to the doctors. She threw a winter coat over her yoga pants and sweatshirt and headed outside.  It wasn't cold, but she wasn't warm.  Walking her neighborhood, sobbing, she listened through her headphones as the doctors laid out his prognosis: He was so far gone, they told her, putting him on a ventilator would only prolong the inevitable. His lungs, destroyed by the infection, would probably never recover.  She read and reread her father's living will. He was so strong, and she wanted to hope. But she knew what he would want: Pain relief only. No ventilator. No dialysis. No CPR. When she made the decision, the doctor sounded relieved.  She saw her neighbors, and her neighbors saw her, crying on the side of the road. Their first instinct was to hug. They didn't. They couldn't.  Her decision made, Reinhard returned home and dialed back into her father's room. The nurses propped the phone on his pillow, so his children could hear him breathe.  As she listened to his breath, Reinhard settled at a desk and began to type. She wanted to capture the experience, absorb it.  It feels so good to laugh and cry. To be connected on the phone with you and my brother and sisters. To bring the images of us from earlier years back to life. It also feels good to hear you breathe. That rhythmic, white noise is the background music to our call.  At times, his breathing fell silent. Long seconds, a minute. She held her own breath, fearing what silence meant.  Breathe, Dad. We need to hear you breathe.  Then, finally, he would inhale, and she let out a long, grateful sigh.  I have never loved and appreciated breath the way I love and appreciate breath right now.  Evening fell, and Reinhard and her husband put their kids to bed. She typed out her feelings during the long hours and fell asleep to her father's breath.  Monday came. Adair was still hanging on. His breathing became harder, his lungs thick with the mucus that has come to define many coronavirus cases. Reinhard likened the sound to someone using a straw in a cup of paste. She wondered: Should she have pushed the doctors to put him on a ventilator?  My own chest is feeling tight now, as I imagine your lungs filling, while the virus seeps in. You just moaned softly, and I don’t know if you’re trying to say you love us, or if you’re in pain.  I pray you can see angels behind your closed eyes. That you can feel their love – and ours. That you can hear us on the other end of the phone. That you can sense the stirrings of your soul even while your body is becoming numb.  OK, here come faint, short flicks of white noise. Thank God. I just said the Lord’s Prayer, in short bursts between my attempts at squelching my sobs so my kids can’t hear me. I feel the pressure of the wailing behind my eyes, as I whimper like a dog, and wipe the tears away. I feel it in my throat now too, the pressure.  Grief is a strange thing. It comes in unpredictable waves. At one point earlier, I felt slightly guilty because I actually felt OK. And now here I am, pushing back against a huge wave of pain as it crests and I try to breathe through it. I’m breathing. You're breathing. We’re OK.  The phone went silent. Ten minutes without a sound.  You’re back! The phone had slipped. Thank you, God. Now we hear short, shallow breaths – each one a miracle. You’re here. We’re here. With obvious relief, we're each telling you again how much we love you. Baby Skylar is hiccuping on Carrie’s line. This is life, and this is death. The newborn baby on the phone with the grandfather she’ll never meet.   We hear you, Dad.  She could hear the nurses repositioning him. They were heroes, she thought, risking their lives for his comfort. “Goodnight, Don,\" she heard one say. \"I’ll see you tomorrow.”  The siblings tired. The stories slowed. Reinhard ate a slice of pizza. Her 8-year-old daughter, Caroline, popped in to ask if Grandpa Don sounded better. Reinhard told her, truthfully, that he sounded more calm.  \"Yes!\" Caroline said. \"There have been a lot of recoveries.\" Then her smile faded. \"And a lot of deaths.\"  I wonder how the coronavirus will shape my kids and their generation? I think now about what shaped you and your fellow Boomers. Vietnam... a war against communism in a distant land. Today it’s the coronavirus ... a war waged against droplets in the air, all around us.  Reinhard and her siblings agreed to take a break. They needed to care for themselves, as their father would have wanted. They went to sleep, but no one hung up.  Just after midnight, another call came in. She knew what it was. She braced for it.   Gone. You’re gone.  She'd been on the line with him almost 36 hours. If she'd stayed on just one more hour, she could have been with him when he died. Maybe he didn't want his kids to hear him go.  If I'm honest, maybe part of me didn't want to hear your last gasps of air.  She looked down at her iPhone, still connected to his hospital line.  \"I love you, Dad,\" she said in to the phone.  She paused for a few moments. She pressed the red button to end the call.  Here comes the pain again. So heavy.  First, she emailed her writing to friends and family. They shared it with others. It inspired her husband's colleague to reach out to his estranged father. Moved by their reconciliation, Reinhard posted her writing publicly to Facebook. She wanted people to understand the toll of the virus.  As a business owner, she understands why people are aching to get back to work. She has 36 employees, and she worries about them, too.  Reinhard hopes her words can help other Americans understand that coronavirus isn't an abstract threat affecting only big cities. It's everywhere. It takes loved ones who should have lived healthy lives for years to come.  \"To experience that threat on an emotional level makes it more real,\" she said. \"To be 6 feet apart from your mom when you're crying? I haven't been able to hug my mom.\"  They buried Adair in the lonely new way – a few words, the Lord's Prayer and \"Amazing Grace.\" Nine people and five minutes at a graveside at the family plot 10 miles from where he died. Her siblings couldn't be there. She sent them a video.  \"Can you imagine? Seeing a video of your dad's burial?\"  Easter came, and her son turned 7.  She still talks to her father. She can still hear him breathing on the other end of the line.  I hear myself gasping as well. He, no longer in his body. And I, not quite in mine.  Staying Apart, Together.

It’s a defining question for a cloistered nation - and a political imperative for Trump. His reelection could ride on the pace of an economic rebound and Congress is sprinting to approve a $483 billion coronavirus aid package this week.  But a new survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows most Americans don’t believe it will be safe to ease the restrictions anytime soon, despite isolated protests in states aimed at lifting aggressive stay-at-home measures.  Here are some of AP’s top stories Wednesday on the world’s coronavirus pandemic. Follow APNews.com/VirusOutbreak for updates throughout the day and APNews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak for stories explaining some of its complexities.   WHAT’S HAPPENING TODAY:  - Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says it’s time to “push the pause button” on federal spending, even as Congress rushes to approve a $483 billion coronavirus aid package this week. The deal would replenish a small-business payroll fund and pump more money into hospitals and testing programs.  - Federal officials say two pet cats in New York state have tested positive for the new coronavirus, marking the first confirmed cases in companion animals in the United States and joining a small number of confirmed cases of the virus in animals worldwide. The cats had mild respiratory illnesses and are expected to recover.  - A survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that Americans largely believe restrictions on social interaction to curb the spread of the new coronavirus are appropriate. Despite pockets of attention-grabbing protests, the survey finds Americans remain overwhelmingly in favor of stay-at-home orders and other efforts to slow the spread of the virus.  - Health officials say two people died with the new coronavirus in California weeks before the first reported death from the virus. Santa Clara County officials said the people died at home Feb. 6 and Feb. 17.  - Tyson Foods suspended operations at an Iowa plant that is critical to the nation’s pork supply but had been blamed for fueling a massive coronavirus outbreak in the community. The company said the indefinite closure of the Waterloo, Iowa, plant would deny a vital market to hog farmers and further disrupt the nation’s meat supply.   ___  WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:  For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. The vast majority of people recover.  Here are the symptoms of the virus compared with the common flu.  One of the best ways to prevent spread of the virus is washing your hands with soap and water. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends first washing with warm or cold water and then lathering soap for 20 seconds to get it on the backs of hands, between fingers and under fingernails before rinsing off.  You should wash your phone, too. Here’s how.  TRACKING THE VIRUS: Drill down and zoom in at the individual county level, and you can access numbers that will show you the situation where you are, and where loved ones or people you’re worried about live.   ___   ONE NUMBER:  - 10 MILLION: There are over 70 million people worldwide who have been driven from their homes by war and unrest, up to 10 million are packed into refugee camps and informal settlements, and almost none have been tested for the new coronavirus.

When the news touches our daily lives, our personal story becomes a national one.  I’m inspired by what I see on my newsfeed: people making sense of a world event by reflecting on how it is changing them and their families. I am the director of an NGO called Video Volunteers , which has spent nearly 15 years helping the communities we work with in India do just that. And so, I feel a tremendous sense of hope, that we’re no longer in our silos, telling a million disparate stories.  What follows, then, is the Covid-19 story of my organisation as India finishes its fifth week of lockdown. Civil society organisations are critical to finding the brightest path out of the coronavirus crisis, and stories of grassroots adaptation and response are particularly needed now.  Across India right now, thousands of citizens are engaged in direct relief work, providing people with cash and food. From my neighbours in the village in Goa where I live, to the Video Volunteers correspondents in far-flung districts, untold numbers of citizens have become first-time activists, or better activists.  Our community correspondents — people like Shabnam, who profiled a starving seven-year-old old girl living under a tent, and Aamir, Laxmi, Bikash, Faisal, Jahanara and Zainab, who are distributing rations to thousands of people — are finding that their training has made them the ideal responders for this crisis.  Video Volunteers provides cash support to correspondents in Lucknow, Bhind, Gwalior, Patna, Cooch Behar, and Kishanganj to purchase rations for needy families. We provide direct support to 24 correspondents, with more on the way. We surveyed our network about their food security, asking them if any of them were having trouble accessing or purchasing food for two square meals a day.  Shockingly, 40 percent of our correspondents did not have the money to buy enough food. Despite their own suffering, many are doing relief work.  The reason millions are hungry in India is because the government announced the lockdown with almost no planning around protecting the poor. With no work and all public transportation stopped, millions simply started walking along the highways to home, as reported by Shambu in Rajasthan and by Roshan in Jammu .  I knew the situation was dire when, on Day 3 of the lockdown, Yasin from West Bengal, a man who has helped us build our garden, showed up at our doorstep saying he and 145 other daily-wage earners had no food. The mother of my children’s close friends, who works as a household help, has also needed our help in feeding her family. The Rs 700 a day they earn as labourers pays for that day’s food.  So, no work means no food.  A platform for citizen action that Video Volunteers has helped to set up in Goa, called ActforGoa.org, is helping to coordinate food for migrants. We’re also connecting the various citizen efforts and circulating fact-based information.  I am also feeling the pain of the under-resourced media in a time like this, something I know rural communities feel every day. Some newspapers tell us only what the government promises — more hospital beds, financial relief for migrants, new schemes — but not what the government is actually delivering. There’s sometimes a massive gap in ground reports in India.  Covid-19 has made this worse, with journalists unable to travel freely. Like everyone else, our reporters are under lockdown, at the time they are needed most. Our new show tries to fill that gap.  What does the future hold for India?  Hearing their many inspiring stories of citizen action makes me feel less alone; but hearing from them about the impending disaster, makes me very, very worried.  Though India’s number of cases is currently very low, one thing is for sure: when the pandemic hits the overcrowded slums and villages — all with barely-there medical facilities — it will be disastrous. This is a situation that the government absolutely cannot handle alone. The only hope at the community level is a coordinated effort by the government, civil society organisations, and engaged citizens.  Citizens need to know and do three things:  1. They need to be aware and motivated. That’s why our “work from home” project for our correspondents is to build local WhatsApp groups that will share verified information and help the village prepare for the crisis.  2. They need to know the ground realities: That’s why we’ve drafted a village-level preparedness survey that will help the villages where we work ascertain which public infrastructure and services most urgently must be fixed.  3. Finally, they need to monitor the local government programmes that will be crucial for people’s survival in the coming year, and then demand improvements. This, thankfully, is what correspondents have always done so well.  The time is now, not tomorrow, for India to improve public health and governance in rural areas and small towns. Our correspondents, as well as numerous NGOs and civil society organisations, are ready to unleash their talents on a crisis they are uniquely suited to tackling.   ***  Journalists are on the ground, bringing you untold stories from areas often ignored by the public eye.

They've been warning about the next pandemic for years and criticized the Trump administration's decision in 2018 to dismantle a National Security Council directorate at the White House charged with preparing for when, not if, another pandemic would hit the nation.  'It would be nice if the office was still there,' Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Health, told Congress this week. 'I wouldn't necessarily characterize it as a mistake (to eliminate the unit). I would say we worked very well with that office.'  The NSC directorate for global health and security and bio-defense survived the transition from President Barack Obama to Trump in 2017.  Trump's elimination of the office suggested, along with his proposed budget cuts for the CDC, that he did not see the threat of pandemics in the same way that many experts in the field did.  'One year later I was mystified when the White House dissolved the office, leaving the country less prepared for pandemics like COVID-19,' Beth Cameron, the first director of the unit, wrote in an op-ed Friday in The Washington Post.  She said the directorate was set up to be the 'smoke alarm\" and get ahead of emergencies and sound a warning at the earliest sign of fire \" \"all with the goal of avoiding a six-alarm fire.\"  It's impossible to assess the impact of the 2018 decision to disband the unit, she said. Cameron noted that biological experts remain at the White House, but she says it's clear that eliminating the office contributed to what she called a 'sluggish domestic response.' She said that shortly before Trump took office, the unit was watching a rising number of cases in China of a deadly strain of the flu and a yellow fever outbreak in Angola.  'It's unclear whether the decision to disband the directorate, which was made in May 2018, after John Bolton became national security adviser, was a tactical move to downgrade the issue or whether it was part of the White House's interest in simplifying and shrinking the National Security Council staff,\" Cameron says.  The NSC during the Obama administration grew to about 250 professionals, according to Trump's current national security adviser, Robert O'Brien. The staff has been cut to about 110 or 115 staffers, he said.  When Trump was asked on Friday whether closing the NSC global health unit slowed the U.S. response, the president called it a 'nasty' question because his administration had acted quickly and saved lives.  'I don't know anything about it,' Trump said.  Earlier, when asked about it, he said: 'This is something that you can never really think is going to happen.\"  On Saturday, John Bolton, a former Trump national security adviser, dismissed claims that 'streamlining NSC structures impaired our nation's bio defense are false.'' In a tweet, he said global health \"remained a top NSC priority, and its expert team was critical to effectively handling the 2018-19 Africa Ebola crisis. The angry Left just can't stop attacking, even in a crisis.''  For many years, the national intelligence director's worldwide threat assessment has warned that a flu pandemic or other large-scale outbreak of a contagious disease could lead to massive rates of death and disability that would severely affect the world economy. Public health experts have been blowing whistles too.  Back in mid-2018, Fauci told Congress: 'When you have a respiratory virus that can be spread by droplets and aerosol and ... there's a degree of morbidity associated with that, you can have a catastrophe. ... The one that we always talk about is the 1918 pandemic, which killed between 50 and 100 million people. ... Influenza first, or something like influenza, is the one that keeps me up at night.'  The White House says the NSC remains involved in responding to the coronavirus pandemic.  A senior administration official said Friday that the NSC's global health security directorate was absorbed into another division where similar responsibilities still exist, but under different titles. The work of coordinating policy and making sure that decisions made by Trump's coronavirus task force are implemented is still the job of the NSC.   Some lawmakers aren't convinced.  Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., and Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, have introduced a bill that would require future administrations to have experts always in place to prepare for new pandemics.  'Two years ago, the administration dismantled the apparatus that had been put in place five years before in the face of the Ebola crisis,' Connolly said. 'I think, in retrospect, that was an unwise move. This bill would restore that and institutionalize it.'  Connolly said the bill is not meant to be critical of the Trump administration. He said it's a recognition that Trump had to name a coronavirus responder just like Obama had to name one for Ebola in 2014. 'We can't go from pandemic to pandemic,' Connolly said.  The House Foreign Affairs Committee on March 4 passed the measure, which is co-sponsored by 37 Democrats and five Republicans. The full House has not yet voted on the bill.  Chabot said one of the bill's main goals is to would require personnel to be permanently in place preparing for pandemics.  'Specifically, we need someone, preferable at the NSC, to quarterback the U.S. government's response since that response inevitably involves several agencies across the government,' Chabot said. 'Our bill would make this position permanent.\"  Former Obama administration officials insist that the Trump White House would have been able to act more quickly had the office still been intact.  'I think if we'd had a unit and dedicated professionals looking at this issue, gaming out scenarios well before ... we might have identified some of these testing issues,' says Lisa Monaco, President Obama's homeland security adviser, said at a recent forum on coronavirus. 'There would have been folks sounding the alarm in December when we saw this coming out of China, saying 'Hey, what do we need to be doing here in this country to address it?'  Ron Klain, who managed the government response to contain and mitigate the spread of Ebola in 2014, agreed.  \"If I were back in my old job at the White House ... I'd be pushing to have us do 30 million tests \" to test people in nursing homes, to test people with unexplained respiratory ailments, to test the people who regularly visit nursing homes, to test healthcare workers,\" Klain said recently at the event hosted by the Center for American Progress in Washington.

The US Department of Energy’s (DoE) emergency petroleum supply will be filled to the brim, Trump said at the White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing on Monday.  “We are filling up our national petroleum reserves. We are looking to put as much as 75 million barrels into the reserves themselves,\" Trump told reporters at a daily news conference. \"That would top them out. That would be the first time in a long time it has been topped out.\"  The DoE had previously moved to allow companies to lease space in the strategic reserve’s tanks for up to 77 million barrels of oil.  The Strategic Petroleum Reserve was established after the 1973-74 oil shock, when Arab oil-producing nations sought to punish Western support for Israel in the Yom Kippur War by sharply hiking petroleum prices. The network of underground tanks in Louisiana and Texas is capable of holding some 797 million barrels of crude oil.  Trump initially announced his intent to fill the reserves “up to the top” on March 13, when he first declared a national emergency. At that time, the move was intended to mitigate economic fallout from the COVID-19 crisis, which at the time had infected just 1,800 Americans and killed 41. On Monday, the US had registered 770,000 cases and seen more than 37,000 Americans die.  However, the DoE ditched a plan to buy up 30 million barrels after congressional lawmakers did not include funding for the purchase in national economic stimulus legislation. A separate bill explicitly providing $3 billion toward the initiative was introduced earlier this month, but has failed to progress.  The move comes amid historically low oil prices as petroleum producers run out of storage space. May futures for West Texas Intermediate petroleum collapsed on Monday, falling to negative $13.10 per barrel after hitting a low of negative $40.32 per barrel, even as OPEC+ nations have struck a deal to mutually slash oil production.  Trump told reporters he believed the negative oil futures were “a short-term squeeze,” adding it was mostly a financial phenomenon in which “a lot of people got caught” short-selling. He also noted he would look into stopping oil shipments from Saudi Arabia to the US amid the market glut.

Most have moved out of dorms. Their classes have moved online. Labs and performing arts classes now bear little resemblance to normal.  But one thing hasn't changed, at least at some colleges: They're still being graded.  A chorus of students from across the country is lobbying schools to stop grading on a traditional letter scale this semester. Instead, students are asking for a pass-or-fail system.  It's hard enough to manage the major disruptions caused by COVID-19 without having to worry about grades, they argue. Moving to online classes brings its own difficulties, too, as some subjects typically require in-person, hands-on elements that don't translate well to video.  Pass/fail grading allows students to receive either a P for pass or F for fail instead of a standard A-F letter grade. Students in favor of this grading option say it helps ensure they learn the required material sufficiently without adding in the pressure of letter grades.  Their efforts have gained traction in some states.  In Florida, three large state universities announced March 24 they would switch to pass/fail grading in response to student petitions.  The University of Wisconsin-Madison declared on March 26 that the \"unprecedented situation\" called for a pass/fail grading option. Allowing the option means other academic policies may have to adjust, too, the school said.  \"Maintaining instruction and the quality of academics is and has been our most important campus goal, short of preserving the health and safety of our community,\" the university said. \"Recognizing that our lives have been significantly impacted by COVID-19, our grading and credit policies must adapt.\"  But so far, efforts by some students haven't succeeded in convincing administrators. Some colleges have made small concessions: The University of Arizona is allowing students to request pass/fail grading from professors.  The argument in favor of pass/fail grading focuses on how students from more privileged backgrounds likely will fare better in the coronavirus-era environment of online courses and staying at home.  All students have to weather the pandemic, but some have lost their income, and their parents have lost income. Some don't have family safety nets to fall back on. Some are struggling to find a safe place to stay or healthy food to eat. Some are getting sick, or their family members are. Some don't have reliable internet access.  The fair move is to take grades off the table for now, advocates say.  \"The students that may be subject to homes in which they don't have decent internet access, or they're concerned about their parents and very anxious about what's going to be happening for the rest of the world, those are the students that are going to be very, very disenfranchised,\" said Alejandro Urbina, a 19-year-old sophomore honors student studying aerospace engineering at Arizona State University, who is lobbying for pass/fail.  \"And there are many more of them than there are students that might not get their 4.0.\"   The argument against pass/fail  In an emailed response to Urbina, Vice Provost Frederick Corey explained that ASU has more technology and experience for working online than other universities. He said grades are important to students, employers and graduate programs. It wouldn’t be fair to high-achieving students to institute pass/fail options, Corey wrote.  “To award everyone performing at A, B, C or D levels a grade of Passing is unfair to those who excel in their classes and could, ultimately, be a significant disservice to students with high aspirations for graduate school, law school, medical school or other endeavors where grades play an important role in competitive admissions,” Corey’s email to Urbina said.  But at the University of Arizona, administrators are now allowing students to change a course to pass/fail if they want. An individual student can ask for a class to be counted as pass/fail for them up until the last day of classes, an email to students from Provost Liesl Folks states.  Some colleges already changed grading  Ivy League schools, the country's most elite institutions, have largely put some type of alternative grading in place, either as an option or mandatory change. Students at some of these universities are now pushing for \"universal pass,\" where every student passes this semester. Students at Yale University, for instance, are now behind a movement called \"No Fail Yale.\"  Clemson University in South Carolina said a few of its courses could be taken pass/fail, but otherwise the university has not heeded a student petition with thousands of signatures.  Aleah Cherry, who started the Clemson petition, said she was concerned about keeping up with the demands of being a STEM major in online classes.  “I started voicing my concerns to my friends when I realized they were worried too,” Cherry said. “I have friends with ADHD and learning disabilities who already struggle with learning in the classroom and others who have never taken online classes, and we are concerned that the switch to online will negatively affect (our) academic performance.”  Little time to adjust to online classes  The University of Tennessee, Knoxville will allow students to opt in to a pass-fail grading scale for most undergraduate and some graduate classes, campus officials announced last week.  Haylee Maniaci, a fourth-year psychology student at UT, said she was \"overwhelmed\" when she first learned classes were shifting online. As cancellations and closures across Knoxville piled up, things got much harder.  \"I am a restaurant manager, and we are working a lot just to keep the doors open,\" said Maniaci, who is managing her course load and her job.  She lives alone in Knoxville and is working more not just because her employers need her, but also because she needs the income. School is the last thing on her mind.  \"There are just too many other stressors going on in the world right now,\" Maniaci said. \"I had two exams yesterday, which I couldn't focus on because I was at work all day trying to make enough money to keep (the restaurant) open and stay employed.\"  Contributing: Zoe Nicholson of The Greenville News in South Carolina and Allie Klouse of the Knoxville News Sentinel in Tennessee  Contact reporter Rachel Leingang by email at rachel.leingang@gannett.com or by phone at 602-444-8157, or find her on Twitter and Facebook.

The project received $1 million from the International Development Research Centre as part of the $27 million in coronavirus research the federal government announced Friday.  The technology being developed by Keith Pardee, an assistant professor of pharmacy at the University of Toronto, aims to make it possible for people in remote areas to test for the virus very quickly. Xinyu Liu, an associate professor of engineering at the university, is working to make the test portable.  The ultimate goal is to create a kit that would fit into a container about twice the size of a standard moving box, which would contain the diagnostics and hardware to perform 14,000 COVID-19 tests.  “What we are trying to do is make that functional clinical capacity available more globally,” Pardee said.  The World Health Organization has warned of the danger of the virus spreading in countries without the capability to detect it in patients, which could facilitate an even larger global outbreak. Pardee hopes this technology will eventually be able to help curb that.  It could also be useful here at home, in remote northern communities for example, or ports of entry.  “In places like Canada, our technology would be best suited for decentralized places, like airports and maybe your neighbourhood pharmacy.”  Pardee first developed the technology while working on his post-doctorate in 2014, which allowed he and his fellow researchers to make paper sensors for particular diseases. The team tested the technology on the Zika virus and have validated the diagnostics in patient trials with teams in Brazil, Ecuador and Colombia.  The technology is already reliable in a lab setting, Pardee said, and the grant money will go toward making it accessible to people without specific scientific skills.  Once it’s finished, the lab-in-a-box could be repurposed to respond to future potential pandemics with only a few weeks’ lead time.  Four labs are working on different parts of the project, including teams of viral respirologists in Vietnam and Brazil who will be focused on patient testing.  The federal $27-million package will support 47 research teams from across Canada to develop, test, and implement ways to deal with the global COVID-19 outbreak.  “This is about making sure that Canada is able to participate in this research that is happening globally, that we have Canadian solutions being developed,” Health Minister Patty Hajdu said Friday in Montreal.

By Caitlin Johnstone   CaitlinJohnstone.com  Former President George W. Bush is in the news and once again it’s not for the only legitimate reason that he should ever be in the news, namely a war crimes tribunal. No, it’s because his voice was used in a cutesy feel-good video about unity during the Covid-19 pandemic.  “Let us remember how small our differences are in the face of this shared threat,” Bush is heard saying. “We are not partisan combatants. We are human beings, equally vulnerable and equally wonderful in the sight of God.”  And, needless to say, Democrats are all over social media orgasming in their pants about it.  “This video made me ugly cry,” tweeted actress-turned-McResistance pundit Alyssa Milano.  “A REAL president,” tweeted the other Alyssa Milano, Debra Messing.  “In a million years I never thought I’d be crying watching this, thinking how much better we’d all feel if Bush were president today,” tweeted former Democratic Congresswoman Katie Hill to thunderous online applause.  >>Please Donate to Consortium News’ 25th Anniversary Spring Fund Drive<<  The Intercept‘s Mehdi Hasan spent all day on Twitter defending his position that Dubya is superior to Trump, at one point even arguing “You can be a sane warmonger. You can be a warmonger but be an ok human being to your friends and family. You can be a warmonger and be able to handle a domestic public health crisis.”  In a million years I never thought I’d be crying watching this, thinking how much better we’d all feel if Bush were president today. Wtf. https://t.co/SSR3ieZEFP — Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) May 2, 2020  For years rank-and-file Democrats have been giving the true Butcher of Baghdad a majority approval rating, running with the common narrative that while Bush perhaps made some “mistakes,” Trump is spectacularly worse. Here are five things that are highlighted by that common perspective:  No. 1. It shows how little Democrats care about the lives of human beings overseas.  By the end of his first term Bush had launched two full-scale ground invasions, murdered a million Iraqis, destabilized an entire region in a way that would shortly give rise to ISIS, and ushered in a whole new level of unprecedented U.S. military expansionism and imperialism. Trump has done none of these things. He has inflicted many evils upon our world and, like former President Barack Obama, has continued and expanded the warmongering of his predecessors. But he has done nothing that rises to the level of depravity of Bush’s wars.  The fact that Democrats see Trump’s evils as not only equal to but far in excess of Bush’s reveals as plain as day that, for all their supposed bleeding-heart liberal sensibilities, they simply do not place much value on the lives of foreigners. Sure, they might enjoy a little masturbatory melodrama over kids in cages when it shows up on their doorstep, but kids getting ripped to shreds by cluster bombs and being born severely disabled from depleted uranium munitions simply does not register for them, because they don’t have to look at it.  They do not care. Rude tweets and racism are worse than institutionalized mass murder for them, because they have to look at one but not the other.  No. 2. It shows that Trump-era Democrats are Bush-era Republicans.  The problem is that Bush and Cheney’s operatives, speechwriters, policy advisers, propagandistas and top aides are the close friends and colleagues of media liberals and DC Democrats and their beloved pundits, so they have to whitewash Bush’s evil to justify themselves: https://t.co/Z1C3CB7JQn — Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) May 3, 2020  “Dems have no choice but to rehabilitate George Bush because their core narrative is the US was a fundamentally good and decent land before Trump vandalized it,” journalist Glenn Greenwald tweeted in response to Democrats’ fawning over Bush, adding, “How do you join with Bill Kristol, Nicole Wallace, Rick Wilson, David Frum and the CIA without whitewashing Bush’s crimes?”  Indeed, Bush-era neocons have been able to fully ingratiate themselves to and integrate themselves with Democrats in the age of Trump by posing as moral opposition longing for a more civilized time when presidents would politely butcher humans by the hundreds of thousands without using offensive language like “shit hole.” A gentlemanly time for gentlemanly presidents to unfold gentlemanly torture and surveillance policies all around the world without posting rude tweets about celebrities they don’t like.  Trump-era Democrats are Bush-era Republicans. That’s how far to the authoritarian right the party has moved in the last few years on important matters like foreign policy. You can see this by the shrieking, hysterical response they had to Tulsi Gabbard calling for what more or less amounted to a simple reversion back to pre-9/11 U.S. foreign policy. It has been necessary for Democrats to gaslight themselves into this position because for three presidential campaigns in a row–Obama 2012, Clinton 2016, and now Biden 2020–they’ve had to find ways of convincing themselves that a politician who has facilitated Bush’s foreign policy agendas would make a good commander-in-chief.  No. 3. It shows how the amnesia-inducing effects of the mass media news churn make it difficult to retain perspective.  The News Churn Memory Hole: How The MSM Lies Even When Telling The Truth \"It’s not enough to simply expose the truth. You must also fully, repeatedly and consistently expose the ones who are telling lies.\"https://t.co/OSW6eFQVAn — Caitlin Johnstone ? (@caitoz) December 18, 2019  Mass media propagandists are able to distort perception even while telling the truth using the news churn memory hole. Even when forced to report on uncomfortable truths like not finding any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq or the fact that the occupation of Afghanistan has been justified by an entire generation of lies, the memory of that reporting can be made to fade into the background by frantically reporting on what’s happening right now without referring back to the previous revelations.  Russiagate alone did so much to distort people’s perceptions in mainstream liberal circles. Having the baseless narrative breathlessly promoted year after year after year that the Kremlin had literally seized control of the highest levels of the U.S. government left rank-and-file Democrats who subscribed to it without any sense of scale or proportion, because they were constantly being told that the Most Important Thing Ever was about to happen. How can you hold perspective on a million dead Iraqis when you’re being told day after day, year after year in myriad ways that Russian Hitler was controlling your country but Super Mueller is going to swoop in to the rescue any minute now? It would be very difficult.  No. 4. It shows the glaring difference between fact and narrative.  Most of the mass media reporting on Trump has been factual, it’s just had a ton of narrative spin attached to the facts. It is a fact that Trump frequently says and does dumb, obnoxious and horrible things. It is a fact that many racists think he’s the cat’s pajamas. It is a fact that there was an impeachment and a collusion investigation. But the narrative overlay that has been heaped upon those facts while they’re being reported — the urgency, the alarmism, the hyperbole — leaves viewers with the distinct impression that this U.S. president is awful in a way that is unique and historically unprecedented, and he simply isn’t.  Trump is not worse than Bush, the mass media just yell about him a lot more. If the narratives matched the facts, mass media consumers would be aware that nothing Trump has done is as evil as Bush’s invasion of Iraq alone. In reality Trump didn’t wind up being another Hitler, he wound up being another Obama (not a compliment). And if the narrative spin matched the factual reality, people would understand that.  liberals have the baffling ability to simultaneously believe both that George W. Bush was a good president whom they love and miss dearly AND that Ralph Nader is a piece of shit who's going to burn in hell for supposedly getting George W. Bush elected — i bless the rains down in castamere (@Chinchillazllla) May 3, 2020  No. 5. It shows that this simply is not working.  Imagine you’re out in the woods with a friend you trust in the dark. You know there’s a horrible monster out there stalking you, and suddenly you hear it in the distance coming crashing towards you. It has picked up your scent and it will be upon you in moments.  You turn to run, but your friend grabs you and won’t let you move. He falls to the ground grabbing your legs screaming “No! No! We must stay here! We mustn’t move an inch!”  Who do you need to fight first? The monster? Or your “friend?”  That’s why I focus so much of my criticism on the Democratic Party instead of the Republicans. Ultimately, they’re the party which could actually allow for positive changes to be made to the world, but instead they keep moving further and further into the warmongering totalitarianism they once purported to despise in George W. Bush.  Relying on either head of the two-headed one-party system to make meaningful changes simply is not working, and will not ever work. No institution that would so warmly rehabilitate and welcome a bloodthirsty monster like Bush is going to help humanity one iota. In fact, its sole purpose is to do the exact opposite.

Victoria will go into shutdown from Monday with only essential services remaining open as part of an unprecedented nationwide effort to stop the spread of coronavirus.  The new rules come as Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced sensational new rules all Australians must follow, ahead of stage one of a nationwide shutdown.  Speaking in Canberra on Sunday night, Mr Morrison said social distancing was “our biggest weapon” to dealing with the spread of coronavirus.  “The failure of our public to do that will put people at risk,” Mr Morrison said, after a cabinet meeting of all Australian states.  As of midday on Monday, Mr Morrison said the following would be closed: clubs, licensed premesis, entertainment venues, cinemas, casinos, restaurants and cafes will be restricted to takeaway only, and places of worship.  The Prime Minister also address speculation that schools in certain states would be closed from Tuesday.  “Children should go to school tomorrow,” he said.  He also added the National Cabinet would meet again on Tuesday night.   What will remain open:   — Supermarkets   — Banks   — Pharmacies   — Petrol stations  — Freight and delivery services  — Butchers, bakeries and greengrocers   — Newsagencies   — Bottle shops  — Accommodation section of hotels   What will shut down:  — All schools from Tuesday  — Hospitality businesses including bars and cafes  — AFL season, suspended for two months  — Retail stores expected to close but can continue selling products online   — Casinos   — Cinemas   — Nightclubs  — Licensed sections of hotels  What we don’t know is affected   — Public transport   — Worksites  All Victorian schools will be shut from Tuesday, as 67 new coronavirus cases were confirmed overnight.  This is the largest 24-hour increase yet, and brings the state’s tally to 296 cases – at least three of which were acquired through community transmission.  The shutdown follows news the AFL will suspend its season until at least May 31.  How well Australia’s health services will cope as cases of the coronavirus continue to grow was up to Australians, according to Prime Minister Scott Morrison.  “If Australians choose not to self-isolate, if Australians choose to not observe the medical advice of keeping the distance that we’ve recommended then, we’d obviously be forced to take very draconian measures in shutting down,” Mr Morrison said in an ABC interview on Sunday night.  “If Australians don’t play their part, they can’t then believe that the system won’t come under greater stress. And this is why we’re trying to be so clear about this.”  Victoria’s earlier move to close school is a breakaway from the federal government’s national approach, the deputy chief medical officer said.  Mr Andrews said a decision on whether to reopen schools after the term break would be “determined following advice from the Chief Health Officer”.  “I will have more to say on these measures tomorrow morning,” he said.  “All measures to be implemented by Victoria are consistent with the health advice provided by the Victorian Chief Health Officer.”  “This is not something that we do lightly, but it’s clear that if we don’t take this step, more Victorians will contract coronavirus, our hospitals will be overwhelmed and more Victorians will die.”  This story will no longer be updated.

RETAILERS REMAIN UNDETERRED BY SHUTDOWN  Major shopping centres including Chadstone, Emporium, The Glen, Northland, Eastland and Box Hill Central will continue to open their doors tomorrow until otherwise directed by the State or Federal governments.  Target, Kmart and Myer also plan to open with business as usual tomorrow.  Vicinity Centres, one of Australia’s largest retail landlords, admits the expected announcement of a shutdown of all non-essential services over the next 48 hours may impact many of the centres, but are waiting for confirmation of what “essential services” are before announcing further plans.  Several smaller and family-run retailers within the centres have already shut their doors, a spokesman confirmed.  “We are currently awaiting guidance from Government around the ‘essential products and services’ that shopping centres provide. If put in place, ‘essential services’ within our centres would remain open to enable the community to purchase and access products and services and could include: supermarkets, fresh food, household items, medical services, health funds, banking, baby supplies, food specialty and delivery, grocers, pet stores, and office/technology supplies any other items deemed essential,” a statement says.  Vicinity CEO and Managing Director Grant Kelley says Vicinity’s teams have been working for several weeks to prepare the business and its retailers and are operationally mobilised to put in place any necessary Government measures as they come into effect.  “We will continue to work with all retailers and services to provide a safe and hygienic environment cleaned thoroughly and regularly so that customers who need to access essential household items, and vital services, can continue to visit our centres with confidence,” he says.  “We know these are uncertain times which call on rapid, decisive measures and we continue to work with all levels of government to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our customers, retailers, teams and the communities in which we are operating.”  This story will no longer be updated.

VICTORIA BREAKS AWAY FROM NATIONAL SCHOOL APPROACH  Speaking shortly after midday on Sunday, deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly said it was not his advice for schools to be closed, despite signals from the NSW and Victorian governments that they were moving that way, regardless of Morrison Government support.  “The Prime Minister is very keen on keeping a federal, national approach but each of states and territories have their own particular issues that they need to deal with,” he said.  “For schools at the moment, there is no change but … things are moving quickly.”  He said the risk to students was low and there were still very few cases of children with the coronavirus.  “There is much that schools can do and are doing to protect kids and to protect staff,” Professor Kelly said.  “There have been very few cases of COVID-19 in children in Australia.  “Kids are not getting sick at the moment.  “In terms of school closures, that could be effective later in the epidemic. My own view is that is not necessary at the moment.”  He said Education Minister Dan Tehan was working closely with state and territory partners to manage the situation.  AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan announced the season’s suspension. Picture: Darrian Traynor/Getty Images  FOOTY OFF: AFL SEASON CANCELLED INDEFINITELY  Football is facing its biggest crisis in history, AFL chief Gillon McLachlan has declared.  The 2020 AFL season is on hold for two months as coronavirus continues to grip the globe, while no AFL Women’s premier will be anointed.  McLachlan said the decision by a number of states – including Victoria – to close borders and impose travel bans had left the league with little choice.  “It was time for the AFL to stop the AFLW and AFL competitions,” he said.  “Over the next 48 hours, the AFL and clubs will detail the drastic and immediate steps we need to be taken to cut costs.  “The AFL industry is facing its biggest financial crisis in our history. But our key priority is to do everything possible to keep players, staff and supporters healthy and well throughout this pandemic.  “Our industry provides livelihoods for thousands and thousands of people. But our key focus at the moment, like every organization in the country, is to do everything that needs to be done to slow the spread of this virus and to keep people as healthy as possible.”  Read more on the AFL’s cancellation, here.   UNIS CANCEL IN-PERSON CLASSES  RMIT has cancelled all face-to-face learning amid government shutdown advice and growing COVID-19 concerns.  In a statement issued by RMIT on Sunday night, the university said as the situation evolves it will follow the advice from authorities.  “RMIT has made the decision to suspend all face-to-face learning and teaching activity on our Australian campuses effective immediately,” the statement read.  “We continue to ask our community to please follow the clear, expert advice available, so we can all play our part in containing the transmission of COVID-19.”  The university is arranging digital assets and services to provide alternatives to traditional learning.  Students will be able to access specific information and resources through the online Canvas portal.  67 NEW CASES CONFIRMED, 3 FROM COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION  Six people are recovering in hospital, 70 people have recovered completely, and more than 22,900 Victorians have been tested to date.  The new cases include 42 men and 25 women, with people aged from late teens to early eighties.  Of the confirmed cases in Victoria, the Department of Health has revealed that three of them were acquired through community transmission.  A total of 256 of the cases are in metropolitan Melbourne with the remaining 25 cases in regional Victoria.  There are eight cases in the Greater Geelong area and three in Ballarat, while the Surf Coast, Warrnambool and Macedon Ranges recorded two each.  Latrobe, Yarriambiack, Gannawarra, Hepburn, Moorabool, Mitchell, Mildura and Greater Shepparton have all recorded one case also.  In a new statement, the Department of Health warned that those who don’t comply with social distancing regulations could receive a fine of up to $20,000, while companies face fines of as much as $100,000 with Victoria Police enforcing the directives.   PRINCIPALS APPLAUD SCHOOL CLOSURES  Principals groups have welcomed the plan to close Victorian schools.  And with just four days left of the school term — Victoria has announced a statewide student-free day for Friday — the impact of school closures was expected to be less keenly felt in Victoria than other states.  Victorian Principals Association president Anne-Marie Kliman said closures were “inevitable” and that there had been a high level of community pressure to shut campuses down.  “Principals are already having to deal with high pressure in their communities,” she said.  “People are already taking their kids and walking away,” she said.  Data from Compass shows student absences in schools across Australia skyrocketed through the week.  On Monday, 18.5 per cent of students were not in school and were using the education platform off-site — double the rate of student absence to the same time in 2019.  By Friday, the number of pupils away had risen to 27.5 per cent.  Australian Principals’ Federation federal president Julie Podbury said if schools close “there will be a lot of relieved people”.  “Staff are really starting to panic.”  As stronger measures to deal with the coronavirus pandemic were announced through the week, education staff raised heightened concerns over the potential of exposure in schools for those who were medically vulnerable or with sick and elderly loved ones.  The Department of Education then urged principals to assist in allowing medically vulnerable staff to work from home.  But that direction caused further issues for principals, who still required staff to care for students while campuses were still open.  Victorian Association of State Secondary Principals president Sue Bell said it wasn’t known whether a school closure would mean the campus was completely shut, or if staff could still work on-site.  She questioned whether the closures would include childcare centres.  “Closure if a very strong word and we don’t know what that means yet,” she said.  She believed teachers would be pleased if schools were shut amid raising health and safety concerns.  Victoria is entering into a shutdown. Picture: Andrew Henshaw  Federation Square was near-deserted over the weekend. Picture: Getty Images  PRIME MINISTER ANNOUNCES NEW STIMULUS MEASURES  All non-essential travel will be halted under new strict regulations being announced by the Prime Minister this morning.  Scott Morrison highlighted that some Australians were not abiding by social distancing measures, and as such, state premiers may have to introduce “draconian measures”.  “What happened at Bondi Beach yesterday was not OK … Too many Australians are not taking these issues seriously enough,” he said  “We need [Australians] to comply with the healthy distancing, the social distancing measures that we have put in place.”  Mr Morrison said a $189 billion package will support pensioners and other vulnerable members of the community, cushion the blow for small businesses and shield from bankruptcy.  “There is no quick solution. We have to steel ourselves for at least the next six months,” he said.  The measures include doubling job seeker allowances, early access to superannuation and up to $100,000 cash for small to medium businesses.  Asset tests and waiting periods will be waived for unemployed Australians trying to access welfare payments.  Mr Morrison said non-essential travel included interstate and long-distance travel rather than getting to work or picking up food at the shops.  But he warned that families should cancel their school holiday travels, despite the impact it will have on those communities relying on tourism.  “It does mean those holidays you might have been planing to take interstate over the holidays … cancel them,” he said.   ANGLICAN CHURCH SERVICES SUSPENDED  Melbourne’s Anglican services will be suspended from tomorrow to try and contain the spread of COVID-19.  The Archbishop of Melbourne called an emergency meeting on Saturday after which he wrote to Anglicans advising of the mass suspension.  All public services and parish organised group activities have been suspended indefinitely.  Pastors have moved to running online services and using social media to publish sermons and other messages to their communities.  The move follows a similar initiative by the Catholic Church who last week suspended masses across much of the country.  Anglican Archbishop Philip Freier said the decision was not a closure of all ministry.  “The need for Christian ministry is only likely to be heightened over the new weeks and months but it will need to happen in new forms,” he said.  “I hope that our churches can remain open for prayer and contemplation within the current restrictions but can imagine that further tightening of these restrictions may also close that option off.”  Archbishop Freier said Easter services would not proceed as planned.  “The public reports of the number of COVID-19 infections show that we are at the beginning of an exponential rate of infection,” he said.  “It is to be hoped that this can be stopped but the restricted availability of testing means that the reports of infection we are seeing are unlikely to account for all cases of infection.”  CEO of VicHealth Dr Sandro Demaio is encouraging young Victorians to stay home.  VICHEALTH CEO URGES VICTORIANS TO STAY HOME  Dr Sandro Demaio, CEO of VicHealth has encouraged Victorians, especially young people, to stay at home as much as possible  “It’s really common sense, limiting the interaction we have with other people,” he told 3AW.  “Limit the time you’re spending outside and spending with others.”  “For everyone, regardless of their age, regardless of how they feel … We are really encouraging everyone to practice social distancing.”  Dr Demaio said that leaving the house should only be for essential trips.  “If you’re going to the shops, go and do a shop for yourself and your neighbours,” he said.  “If you’re going for a walk, don’t go with other people or interact with other people.”  “There’s no need to panic and there’s no need to close essential functions, but I think having people over for dinner is not necessary.  “We can do that in a month or two months when all this passes.  “It’s a delicate balance not wanting to overstep and send people into a panic.  “Young people going for walks, going out for drinks, could be doing a lot more.”  The same sentiment has been echoed by health professionals Australia wide, with clinical immunologist Dr Dan Suan urging people to take social isolation seriously.  “Stay at home and don’t leave the home unless you absolutely have to,” he told the ABC yesterday.  “Social isolation is not an act of fear, it’s an act of love.  “The reason you’re doing it is in order to protect yourself, your family, your friends and their family.  “The safest thing you can do for yourself and all the people that you love is to bring yourself back into your home, stay safe at home, and not be part of the transmission process of this virus.  “We have to break the transmission from person to person, that’s the only way we’ll flatten the curve.”  VICTORIANS URGED TO DO THEIR ‘CIVIC DUTY’  The Premier admitted that Victoria will “get to a very bad place in terms of public health” in the weeks and months ahead.  Mr Andrews urged Victorians to listen to the government’s advice on isolation measures and social distancing, saying that efforts to contain the virus are “no joke”.  “Thousands of people are almost pretending this isn’t real. It is real,” the premier said. “We have to play a part, the social distancing measures are serious. There is no joking about this.  “If we don’t flatten the curve and suppress the number of people testing positive, the spread of the virus (will continue), hospitals will be overwhelmed and that means more people will die.  Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton echoed the Premier’s words, saying young people in particular need to take social distancing rules more seriously.  “Someone is dying every two minutes in Italy from coronavirus and so, if you care about the people around you, if you think about protecting your family then you have to think about making that distance between you and other people in all settings at all times whatever size,” he said.   FORESHORE CAMPS CLOSE  Campers have been evicted from the Mornington Peninsula foreshore in extreme measures by the council to curb the spread of coronavirus.  Ron and Lorraine Hulme are among dozens of people who had set up home at Rosebud campground and now must leave with amenities being switched off at 5pm today.  Mornington Peninsula Shire notified the campers on Friday that council-managed campgrounds along the McCrae, Rosebud, Rye and Sorrento foreshores would close as it was “a necessary step to protect our community and do our part to flatten the curve of this pandemic”.  Mr Hulme, 73, said the measures “didn’t make sense”.  Lorraine and Ron Hulme have been told they need to leave the Rosebud Forshore Camping Reserve. Picture: Josie Hayden  “They say they want to assist in controlling the spread of the virus, but what are we meant to do, disappear into thin air? Where are we going to go?” he said.  The Hulmes, who had lived in Frankston for 40 years and sold everything three years ago to travel around Australia, have been at the campground since October and had paid to stay until April 25.  Mornington Peninsula Shire mayor Sam Hearn said the council was disappointed its camping season had to end early. “We had advice from health authorities, because there’s the share amenities, to start the process of closing the camp site and we’ll refund the fees pro rata,” he said.  BATTLE OVER START TO FOOTY  The AFL has warned community and junior footy leagues against taking to the field in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.  The Yarra Junior Football League intends to start its season on May 3, despite the AFL urging all Victorian leagues and Auskick centres to halt play until at least May 31 to fight the spread of the virus.  The state’s 82 leagues had been told not to play, said AFL Victoria’s Will Carter.  “Protecting participants, spectators, coaches, umpires and volunteers to help mitigate risks of COVID-19 spreading in public environments is the number one priority,” the league spokesman said.  “Continuing operating Community Clubs and programs risks those environments becoming a mode for spreading the infection.”  YJFL chief executive Tim Murray said the league would monitor the situation and take advice from the Federal Government but hoped to resume training and start playing matches within weeks.  “The AFL recommends games starting on May 31, and we completely understand the AFL’s rationale for this recommendation,” he said.  “The AFL has to consider the gathering of larger crowds, individual leagues’ ability to follow hygiene protocols generally and any issues relating to the movement of AFL players into the VFL competition.  “Not all these criteria are relevant for us.”  The Picola and District Football and Netball League is expected to start its season on April 4 and other leagues are weighing their options.   — Peter Rolfe   CRACKING THE EGG PROBLEM  Victorians have turned to planting their own vegie patches and even stocking up on hens to ensure a supply of eggs as supermarket shelves remain empty.  Darren and Rebecca Walker and their son Benjamin, 11, drove almost 70km to Talking Hens poultry suppliers in Merricks yesterday to buy two chickens.  Ms Walker said a lack of produce at their local supermarket in Mount Waverley, including dwindling numbers of eggs, had prompted her to buy the young laying birds. “The eggs your own chickens lay are magnificent, so I’m building up my flock at the moment due to the shortages at the shop,” she said.  Darren, Benjamin and Rebecca Walker with their new chickens from Talking Hens in Merricks. Picture: Josie Hayden  Talking Hens owner and manager Jason Nethercott said supermarket shortages had led to a tenfold increase in visitors to the farm. “We usually have 100 people or so a week, but this last week it was shy of a thousand and now our whole flock is gone,” he said.  Mr Nethercott said families were trying to be more self-sufficient when it came to food production.  “When people discovered there were no longer eggs on the shelves at supermarkets, they decided it’s a good idea to have a few good laying breeds in the backyard,” he said.   – Rhiannon Down  This story will no longer be updated.

As the predominantly Shiite country marked the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, a day later than much of the Muslim world, another 76 fatalities were declared, raising Iran’s official death toll to 5,650.  Iran has in phases since April 11 allowed the reopening of a number of businesses that were closed as part of measures to curb coronavirus (COVID-19).  The spread of the disease has slowed since the start of April, but Alireza Zali, the anti-coronavirus coordinator for the capital, on Saturday criticised “hasty reopenings”.  They could “create new waves of sickness in Tehran and complicate efforts to bring the epidemic under control”, he said, quoted by the official news agency IRNA.  ALSO READ: Zimbabwe councillor charged with insulting president over coronavirus  Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said Iran has now recorded 89,328 cases of COVID-19, including 1,134 over the past 24 hours, since its first case in February.  The number of Iranian casualties is widely thought to be much higher, however.  Jahanpour reiterated that social distancing and hygiene measures to guard against the novel coronavirus needed to remain in place.  The ministry’s infectious diseases department head, Mohammad Mehdi Gouya, warned of “signs of a fresh outbreak” in provinces such as Gilan and Mazandaran in the north and Qom in central Iran “where we made great efforts to control the epidemic”.  Iran, already weakened by tough US sanctions, has struggled to contain the virus outbreak since reporting its first cases on February 19 — two deaths in the Shiite holy city of Qom.

When humidity was cranked up to 80%, the half-life dropped to six hours. With temperature at 95 degrees and 80% humidity, the half-life of the virus was only one hour. It even worked with no sunlight.  >>> When can America reopen? The National Coronavirus Recovery Commission, a project of The Heritage Foundation, is gathering America’s top thinkers together to figure that out. Learn more here.  Bryan said the test was done on nonporous surfaces such as door handles and stainless steel.  “As the temperature increases, as the humidity increases, with no sun involved, you can see how drastically that half-life goes down on that virus,” Bryan said. “The virus is dying at a much more rapid pace just from exposure to higher temperatures and just from exposure to humidity.”  Bryan stressed that this is not a reason to stop social distancing in summer months, and that continued testing will be done.  President Donald Trump was enthusiastic that outdoors might be preferred to indoors.  “I think a lot of people are going to go outside all of a sudden. People that didn’t want to go outside, they’ll be going,” Trump said.  Even before Bryan’s presentation, Vice President Mike Pence said the White House coronavirus task force looked forward to early summer.  “Our task force actually believes, Mr. President, that if we continue these mitigation efforts in the days ahead as states implement their policies, including phased reopenings that will preserve those gains, we do believe that by early summer we can be in a much better place as a nation with much of this coronavirus pandemic behind us,” Pence said.  Pence said that 16 states have released formal reopening plans—13 of those since the Trump administration issued its three-phase “Opening up America” guidelines for governors last week.  “To your point, Mr. President, states are beginning to make those plans,” Pence said. “We are encouraged to see so many states embrace the phased approach to reopen their economies.”  However, in response to a question, Trump again expressed his anger with Georgia’s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp for allowing spas, salons, tattoo parlors, and other similar businesses where germs can easily spread to reopen.  “I want the states to open more than he does,” Trump said, adding, “I wasn’t happy with it and I wasn’t happy with Brian Kemp. I wasn’t at all happy, and I could have done something about it if I wanted to, but I’m saying let the governors do it. But I wasn’t happy with Brian Kemp.”  On another front, many hospitals across the country feeling financial strain from the COVID-19 virus heard welcome news.  “Given the unique burden on hospitals, we are now encouraging states to restart elective surgeries wherever possible, either statewide or on a county-by-county basis,” Pence said. “We recognize the role elective surgeries play in finances for local hospitals. We will be working with states to enable that.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 11, "positive": 18, "negative": 5, "anger": 7, "surprise": 6, "fear": 3, "trust": 3}, "metadata": ["pandemic", "virus", "coronavirus", "america", "distancing", "donald", "trump", "reopening", "guidelines", "kemp", "germs", "elective", "surgeries", "statewide"]}, {"text": "Mike Fielder was laid off from his energy-sector job before the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic hit.\"It's never a good feeling to get laid off,\" Fielder said.He told KOCO 5 that the oil and gas industry has been hurting for a while, but he never expected the price to drop into the negatives per barrel.\"It was the same thing -- lower oil prices, lower gas prices,\" Fielder said. \"It doesn't make sense.

Sign up here.  About 94 percent of the U.S. is under “stay-at-home” orders due to the novel coronavirus, with millions having to apply for unemployment and finding themselves in situations that just a month ago seemed unthinkable.  The many unknowns surrounding COVID-19, including when this may be over, is causing stress and anxiety that many are seeing seep into their dreams, prompting the hashtag #PandemicDreams.  'SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN EXPECTED' TRACES OF CORONAVIRUS DISCOVERED IN MASSACHUSETTS WASTEWATER  To avoid nightmares, experts advise removing potential triggers, which can be difficult given today’s circumstances. But it’s also important to remember that nightmares are normal occurrences.  “Nightmares are normal nocturnal events that everyone has experienced during their life, especially during childhood,” Dr. Jeffrey Durmer, a leader in sleep health care and the chief medical officer of Nox Health, told Fox News. “One reason we think children may have many more parasomnias like nightmares and sleep terrors is that one of the primary functions of sleep in children is neurodevelopment.”  “The incorporation of learned facts and fears, like snakes, spiders and heights, into the memory of developing child is dependent on their daytime experiences and the natural cycles of sleep,” he explained. “Expressing these learned memories is a normal part of brain development and even during childhood it is clear that our experiences, like COVID-19, can induce sleep-related memory systems to activate. Nightmares are one of the potential results of this activity. This is also one of the principal features of PTSD, which underscores the natural function of sleep in the memory formation and learning process.”   AMERICA TOGETHER: UPLIFTING IMAGES  The concern, Durmer said, is when the nightmares begin interfering with sleep on a consistent basis, which he considers to be two or more times per week. In these instances, Durmer said it is likely that the trigger or stimulus that’s causing the nightmares has not been discovered and therefore cannot be avoided.  “In terms of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, nightmares related to this should dissipate following the resolution of the pandemic,” Durmer said. “Continued nightmares or parasomnias may indicate a form of PTSD, which your medical or mental health professional should be able to help you with. Also with the anxiety of social distancing and stay-at-home orders, many people have increased their use of substances like alcohol, marijuana or other stress-relieving chemicals – this is another factor that could trigger both REM and non-REM sleep parasomnias, and should be considered when frequent nightmares or sleep terrors are noted.”  It's also important not to stress over the occasional nightmare, as everyone experiences disruptions in their sleep from time to time, Durmer said.  “A poor night sleep is something that your natural sleep cycles are designed to accommodate by increasing ‘sleep pressure’ in your nervous system resulting in enhanced deep non-REM sleep the following night,” he said.  MYSTERIOUS CONNECTION BETWEEN CORONAVIRUS AND THE HEART  It becomes a concern when the sleep disruption is occurring night after night, which can put you at risk for several health issues such as heart disease, arrhythmias, weight gain, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, depression, stroke and even cancer.  “When sleep disruptions occur night after night, your natural ability to ‘respond’ is diminished and your body and brain immediately suffer the loss of sleep in numerous ways,” he said. “Initially, your mood, memory and other higher cortical functions become impaired, but in addition we now know that sleep-dependent physiological processes like removing toxic metabolites from the brain, managing blood glucose, regulating appetite hormones, resetting insulin receptor sensitivity, controlling blood pressure and immune function begin to fail.”  Talking through your experiences, like sharing them on social media under a specific hashtag, can also help “defuse” the experience and up your chances of getting a restful night's sleep.  “Remember, our ‘new experiences’ activate our emotional and memory systems, which is natural and normal,” he said. “By reducing the emotional impact of new information on our thoughts, we improve the chances of parasomnias from occurring.”  Speaking with a health care physician can also help you find relief, especially one who specializes in sleep medicine. There can be other underlying factors at play, including obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome or even insomnia.  CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE  “Treating the underlying cause of parasomnia and not the symptoms of parasomnia is essential to resolving the situation,” Durmer said. “This is why ‘trying’ over the counter medications or even prescription medications before understanding the cause can be very detrimental. Many people who have recurring sleep-related problems like parasomnias benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy where the underlying fear-evoking issue is explored and new strategies developed to deal with the thoughts and/or behavioral response to [a] specific fear.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 12, "positive": 22, "negative": 6, "disgust": 1, "joy": 1, "anger": 5, "surprise": 1, "fear": 3, "trust": 2}, "metadata": ["coronavirus", "unemployment", "massachusetts", "fox", "children", "america", "stimulus", "distancing", "media", "physician", "syndrome", "symptoms"]}, {"text": "MORRISTOWN, New Jersey -- New Jersey's biggest names both entertained audiences and reminded them that we're all in this together...from a socially acceptable distance.\"Jersey 4 Jersey\" featured a star-studded lineup to raise money to fight the coronavirus pandemic during a special one-hour event on Wednesday night.Money raised benefits the New Jersey Pandemic Relief Fund.Tony Bennett, Jon Bon Jovi, Halsey, Charlie Puth, Bruce Springsteen and Patti Scialfa, and SZA provided musical performances from their home.

(Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images)  Federal, State, and Local Governments Shed Over 170 Regulations to Fight Pandemic  The federal, state, and local governments in the United States have shed more than 170 regulations in order to fight the CCP virus pandemic, according to a list maintained by a taxpayer advocacy group.  The waived regulations fall into roughly two categories: The absence of some makes it easier for doctors, hospitals, and health care companies to respond to the pandemic. Others were shed to help Americans deal with the unprecedented repercussions of closing down vast swaths of the economy.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave states more leeway to test for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) virus, commonly known as the coronavirus. The FDA also loosened restrictions on the distribution and use of newly developed tests, issued dozens of emergency authorizations for new test kits, and eased rules on the production and use of ventilators.  The Department of Health and Human Services lifted restrictions on medical licensing to allow professionals to treat patients across state borders and waived privacy restrictions that prevented doctors from providing telemedicine.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services waived more than a dozen regulations to give doctors more flexibility to provide telehealth services and ease the burden on health care providers by temporarily suspending reporting requirements and audits, among others.  The Department of Transportation lifted restrictions on truckers who drive essential supplies.  The list was compiled by Americans for Tax Reform (ATR), a nonprofit advocacy group.  “The Trump administration and state and local governments are wisely suspending regulations to help fight the coronavirus,” ATR said in a statement.  “Many of these rules and regulations were not necessary in the first place, given their tendency to reduce innovation and access to care, not to mention their restriction on American liberty.”  The growing list, which has been updated regularly as of April 7, includes dozens of regulations shed by state and local government, including the suspension of the ban on plastic bags in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, and New York. The goal of the suspensions is to prevent customers from bringing reusable bags to stores, since they are more likely to spread the CCP virus.  Virginia, Colorado, and North Dakota suspended requirements for car inspections and driver license and registration renewals, according to the list.  Even more regulations can be scrapped to empower American industry to help with the crisis, according to a list released by the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) on April 7. The institute flagged a list of 30 major regulatory hurdles it believes should be addressed as part of the next stimulus bill.  A call to scrap regulations that slow down the approval of new medicines and COVID-19 test kits are at the top of CEI’s list. The institute also calls for the repeal of all state-level “certificate of need” laws, which require health care providers to seek the approval of a state regulator in order to expand their facilities.  While a number of states have waived and loosened medical licensing regulations, CEI notes that more needs to be done in the area, including suspending regulations that restrict physicians’ assistants and nurses from performing procedures they have been trained to carry out.  The institute also calls for shedding restrictions imposed on medical supply sterilization plants, several of which have shuttered after the Environmental Protection Agency issued what CEI calls a “faulty analysis” about a chemical used in the sterilization process.  “We have already seen that many regulations have proven to hinder or delay appropriate policy responses,” CEI said in a statement.  “Other regulations are or were making things worse than they otherwise would be. In many cases, it is now clear that these regulations were never needed, or that whatever justification they once had has been superseded.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 12, "positive": 17, "negative": 10, "joy": 1, "anger": 8, "surprise": 2, "fear": 8, "trust": 6}, "metadata": ["pandemic", "united", "virus", "americans", "unprecedented", "chinese", "fda", "dozens", "borders", "providers", "suspending", "reporting", "nonprofit", "trump", "ban", "institute", "stimulus", "medicines", "kits"]}, {"text": "A Big W store has been forced to immediately close its doors after years of low sales, while the COVID-19 pandemic continues to batter Australia's already embattled retail industry.  The store, which employed 70 people locally in Calmavale, Brisbane, had 'underperformed for some time', bosses said.  It is feared to be one of several potential closures as part of an 'ongoing review' by Big W's owners, Woolworths.  Three Sydney stores were closed in January, with the brand announcing in April 2019 it planned to close up to 30 of its beloved shops.  The Big W store in Calamvale (pictured) has closed its doors with immediate effect, with its 70 staff to be sent to work in other shops  The coronavirus lockdown has left shopping centres deserted as retailers temporarily close their doors (pictured, Westfield in Parramatta on April 1)  A spokesman for Big W said closing the store had been a 'difficult decision', but that the staff would be redeployed to other shops.  Luckily for locals, there are three more Big W stores within 7km of the closed Calamvale store, one at Browns Plains, one at Underwood and the third at Upper Mount Gravatt.  'Today we have made the difficult decision to close our Calamvale BIG W store in Brisbane,' a spokesman told Daily Mail Australia.  'These decisions are never taken lightly, however as part of our ongoing network review, we need to monitor the future potential of each store and unfortunately this one has underperformed for some time.  Kmart is trialling the closure of three stores to focus on the demand on the online service (pictured, Kmart in Parramatta Westfield)  'Under the terms of the lease at Calamvale, we’re obliged to cease trading immediately after giving notice to terminate. We regret the short notice it gives to our team and community.  'We do not anticipate that any future store closures would be subject to such tight time frames.  'We are committed to doing the right thing by our team and will guarantee the redeployment of all current Calamvale team members to one of many neighbouring stores - whether they're full time, part time or casual.'  The store was closed immediately after Big W made the decision not to extend its lease at Calamvale Central shopping centre.  It comes as sweeping changes to Australian retail were brought in during the coronavirus pandemic, which has seen thousands of shops shut their doors.  Australia's retail industry was already struggling with declining sales, which has only been made worse by the lockdown.  Kmart is trailling the closure of a number of stores across Australia as more shoppers choose online shopping during the pandemic.  Certain stores across Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria have temporarily closed while coronavirus restrictions remain in place.  Three out of some 240 stores will trial the closure and instead become online delivery centres to keep up with the current demand for online services.  The department store is offering free delivery for orders over $45.  Myer temporarily closed all its stores and stood down 10,000 staff in March, after suffering a serious decline in footfall.  All Myer stores across Australia will be closed for at least a month due to the coronavirus pandemic (pictured in Sydney)  Bosses said the Australian institution, which is 120 years old, would still be open online.  General Pants, Smiggle, and Peter Alexander have also temporarily closed due to the coronavirus fallout.  Fashion giant H&M has also closed all 49 of its stores in Australia until further notice because of the coronavirus crisis.  The company shutdown will leave as many as 1,300 people without jobs across Australia.  Target owner Wesfarmers is considering selling the department store chain or converting some stores into Kmarts in a bid to save the struggling retailer from extinction.  Target (pictured, its Sydney store) could be sold or converted into Kmarts after the department store's revenue and profits took a 'significant' hit during the coronavirus pandemic  Chief executive Rob Scott has revealed the company is looking to make changes for Target to become 'commercially viable', following a worse than expected slump in sales from the coronavirus lockdown.  The department store's revenue and profits have taken a 'significant' hit during the pandemic, which have left shopping centres deserted as retailers temporarily close their doors.  Australian bootmakers R.M. Williams has also shut all of its stores due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The renowned brand said the coronavirus crisis had 'stopped us mid-stride' and forced it to temporarily close its doors.  The Australian Retailers Association has warned larger fashion companies are most at risk as non-essential services go into lock down and consumers save their money.

Well, unfortunately due to COVID-19, that’s precisely what GMs, coaches and scouting department personnel are going to be doing out of necessity to a much greater extent than usual this draft season. While I always wanted as much information on prospects as possible, I don't think it's a bad thing for teams to be forced to go to the game tape more extensively.  This is all an offshoot of the NFL's pronouncement that prohibits all in-person pre-draft visits and medical re-checks with players until further notice. Thus the usual process has been thrown into turmoil due to the health crisis, and it’s hard to envision how this edict would be lifted before the draft that is now just a few weeks away.  While it will be a detriment for many small college players who weren’t at the Combine or Senior Bowl and have had pro days canceled so more information is needed on them, I can see it actually working in favor of players such as Tua Tagovailoa.   NFL MOCK DRAFT 2020:  49ers, Vikings take advantage of new picks  Teams probably will not be able to have their medical staff fully examine Tagovailoa before the draft. He will continue to share edited workouts via social media (as he did this week) in an attempt to show he is fully recovered from the dislocated hip that ended his 2019 Alabama season after nine games. Players such as Tagovailoa will have their agents and personal physicians send teams filtered information on their physical status.  Teams will be allowed to do video conferencing for up to an hour three times per week with players, and some teams will surely try to watch players working out in these sessions. But that will be of limited benefit compared to seeing a player in-person.​  Tagovailoa is the most prominent player with physical uncertainty in this year's draft. He was examined extensively by team doctors at the Combine, but he wasn’t cleared to work out in Indy and had targeted his April 5 pro day for his full on-field workout, which is now scrubbed. In the video he tweeted, he appeared to move well with his side-to-side and backpedaling movement. But skeptics in the team ranks will wonder if the speed of the video was perhaps altered. And it doesn't show Tua running full speed ahead.  Practicing social distancing with the long ball today. Feels good to spin it again. #Process pic.twitter.com/BZnBF7Sfdc — Tua. T 🇦🇸 (@Tuaamann) March 24, 2020  With no in-depth physicals or re-checks allowed, I see teams talking at length with their medical staff on the likelihood of a full recovery from the injury Tagovailoa sustained along with a discussion on his overall projected durability since he also has dealt with ankle problems and other minor injuries. There will be similar discussions on other players coming off significant injuries.  Assuming a relatively positive response from the team doc, it will be back to the video, which will be a great thing for Tagovailoa. He went 22-2 in his college career, played in two national championships (winning in 2017 when he was the game MVP) and set a new NCAA FBS passer rating record the next year. Over his two seasons as the Crimson Tide starter, he threw an impressive 87 touchdown passes against 11 interceptions and added nine rushing TDs. The video will show a player with great accuracy, QB smarts and mobility for the all-important ability to extend plays before finding the open receiver or running for a first down.  MORE: Will the 2020 NFL Draft be rescheduled?  Despite the caution flags, there's a good chance Tagovailoa will be picked third in this draft after LSU QB Joe Burrow and Ohio State pass-rusher Chase Young. The Dolphins are likely to use their draft capital (six picks in the first three rounds, including three No. 1s) to trade up and not risk losing him — unless they feel the safer pick durability-wise is Oregon QB Justin Herbert at their No. 5 spot. But Herbert won’t get the South Florida ticket buyers as excited as Tagovailoa will.  I think it will work out fine for Tua and other Power 5 conference players who have been well scouted during their college careers and at the Combine and perhaps the Senior Bowl. I believe the greatest negative impact from the pre-draft restrictions will hit the small school players who were relying on their now-canceled Pro Days to showcase their skill sets to NFL GMs, coaches and scouts. And then they were hoping to be invited to team facilities for closer looks.  There also were plenty of Power 5 players who didn’t work out at the Combine, so for them, teams might only have an estimated 40-yard dash time and miss other measurables such as vertical leap. But there’s plenty of game video on them against top competition, so it shouldn’t affect their status as much.   (Getty Images) https://images.daznservices.com/di/library/sporting_news/1c/62/tua-tagovailoa-110719-getty-ftrjpg_13hbd1dmz4dzp1dfg6yw7fxqxc.jpg?t=1194375326&w=500&quality=80  A handful of pro days were held before the shutdown that will benefit players from non-Power 5 schools. Air Force, for example, had one of the last pro days on March 9. For so many other players, it's no such luck.  The problem for such players is that, unless they played several non-conference games against the big schools, it’s difficult for scouts to grade them without seeing them play against NFL-caliber competition.  I also understand this issue through my work with an NFL agent group, as we have several small school rookies who we expected to have good pro days and gain a higher profile on the NFL scouting radar. Now the more likely result is that these players will go undrafted and should be signed as priority free agents after the draft.   MORE NFL DRAFT:  Each team's biggest regret | Weirdest moments  As long as players get signed and compete in a training camp, they will have opportunities to prove their worth in order to make a final roster or practice squad. These under-the-radar players can certainly become eventual starters and stars. That was the case when I signed undrafted defensive tackle John Randle with the Vikings in 1990. He wound up in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  The good news for these players most affected by the current scouting system semi-shutdown is that teams need plenty of late-round picks and undrafted players to make the team at close to minimum salaries in order to balance out the salary cap with the high-priced stars.  In the final analysis, while the NFL has not yet been impacted as much as the other major pro sports leagues have, it’s still strange days indeed for this draft class and the team personnel who are evaluating them.

Two hundred workers at grocery stores, gas stations, restaurants or other businesses that have been open during the county's stay-at-home order will be eligible for testing on a first-come, first-served basis, health department director Clay Goddard said Tuesday.  The idea is to get a \"snapshot\" of how prevalent the disease is among those people who have had contact with the broader community as Greene County sees a slowdown in new cases.  As of Tuesday afternoon, the county hadn't seen a new confirmed case in four days, and mobile testing sites were not using the daily amount of allotted tests.

They do not need a physician's referral.  But if others have symptoms, Goddard said they need to reach out to a doctor to get tested.  Over the weekend, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expanded the possible coronavirus symptoms from fever, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue to chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and a loss of taste or smell.

However, the state order will allow cities and counties to make their own guidelines, and in a City Council lunch meeting Tuesday, local officials indicated they would be releasing stricter guidelines than the state order later this week.  Goddard said at that meeting he thought Greene County had reached its initial peak in infections but cautioned that if additional measures weren't taken, the area could see a graph looking like\"mountain range\" in reoccurring infection rates.

Austin Public Health Interim Authority Dr. Mark Escott, along with Austin Deputy Medical Director Dr. Chris Hewitt, said this testing allows for people to simply fill out a form and see if they qualify for a test given the still-limited amount of tests available.  That means you no loner need a primary care physician referral to get tested.  An algorithm goes through the form, and if the patient is eligible for a test, they can schedule an appointment at one of the testing sites.  This increases testing access to people and is one of the many steps the city needs to reopen businesses, Dr. Escott said.  “I expect thousands of people may want to be tested. And I want to say, in addition to symptomatic individuals, this system allows us to identify areas that have high rates of infection and allow us to, say in those particular areas, we also want to test asymptomatic people,” he explained.  “I am impressed about the direction we’re headed, however we aren’t out of the woods yet,” Dr. Escott said. “It’s important to remember the steps we’ve taken to get to where we are now … it’s working, and we need it to continue working. We have to continue to stay home and only go out for essential needs, we have to continue to social distance.”  Dr. Escott also mentioned the doubling time of confirmed cases has stretched out from 2 days to 10, and with the requirement to wear face coverings in public settings, things are moving in the right direction, but there’s still an increase in total cases.  Over the last seven days, Austin-Travis County has had 394 new cases, Dr. Escott said. The seven days prior to that there were 291 cases, and seven days prior to that there were 214 cases.  Dr. Escott said there needs to be a decrease in cases over a 14-day period so “we can be in a better position to reopen businesses and get people back to work.”  Dr. Hewitt says the goal for the testing sites are to be as efficient as possible.  “We average about eight minutes per person going through out sites,” Hewitt said. “We have tested over 1,000 people at our sites so far, and plan to increase that capacity to up to 2,000 per week as we go forward.”  Hewitt said getting the results quickly is critical, especially when it comes to contract tracing — tracking down people who have come into close contact with a COVID-19 positive patient and monitoring them for any symptoms.  The need for rapid testing  Dr. Escott said right now, it takes about two days get the test results back from local labs. Once the new online portal launches, he said the wait period will remain around two to three days.  “We need much greater scale testing, and we need it quicker and we need it cheaper,” the Interim Health Authority said. “We need a test that would reliably be able to tell us yes or no, this person is infected within a few minutes, 10 or 15 minutes.”  Escott added: “I think the better capacity we have for that, the better ability we’ll have to control this outbreak and do so safely as we reopen businesses.”  Dr. Rodney E. Rohde, who teaches at Austin Community College and Texas State University, said developing fast, reliable testing, especially for a brand new virus, can take months.  “We just didn’t have any background on the virus so we’re starting from ground zero,” he said. “The reason there’s some delay with this is because if a test is only 50 percent effective, what good is it?”  Rohde said he’s hopeful reliable rapid testing will become more widely available in about one to two months. “I think everybody in the country and the world is working on this. We have a lot of smart people working on it. It’s a matter of getting that technology down,” he said.  He told KXAN another problem with testing in general is a shortage in lab workers.  “We only have about 310,000 medical lab professionals in the U.S. So if you look at the population of 350 million, that’s about 1 of me for every 1,130 of you,” he explained.  Escott said he expects in about a month or two, more rapid testing will be available.  “Our ideal situation is to be able to tell people their results within about an hour when they get tested,” he said.

Ten students and a faculty member from Walsh University who were studying abroad in Italy are on their way home today.  Walsh made the decision to bring back the students after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel health notice that recommended avoiding all nonessential travel to Italy and South Korea. It’s due to the spread of the coronavirus, which was first identified in December in Wuhan, China and causes flu-like symptoms that can range from mild to serious. No vaccine to prevent COVID-19 and no specific antiviral treatment currently exists.  Most of the cases of the COVID-19 have been reported in nothern Italy, not in the region of Italy where the students were studying.  No one covers community school news like we do >> Go here for more Stark County education news  Ohio State University and Kent State University are among the other Ohio colleges and universities that also have announced plans to bring their students back from their study abroad programs in Italy.  The CDC on Sunday issued a recommendation that all higher education institutions consider postponing or canceling upcoming student foreign exchange and study abroad programs and should consider asking current program participants to return to their home country. The recommendation applied to travel to any country, including those not yet witnessing an outbreak.   Trip cut short  The Walsh students had arrived in Rome nine days ago to begin their eight-week Global Learning experience in the Eternal City where they were to learn about Italian language history, art, culture, literature and archaeology, as well as visit other destinations in Italy.  They are expected to return to Canton tonight. Walsh has asked the students to remain off campus and to self-monitor for the virus for at least 14 days as a precautionary measure.  Rachel Hosler, associate dean for experiential learning at Walsh, said this is the first time in the 13-year history of Walsh’s Global Learning program in Italy that students have been brought home early.  \"They’re obviously extremely disappointed,\" said Hosler, who has overseen the university’s Global Learning program for the past seven years. \"A lot of them have saved money to study abroad and have been planning this for over a year, but they’re also extremely understanding and know that their health is a priority.\"  Hosler said Walsh is working with the returning students to ensure they can continue their studies without interruption. She also said the university plans to reimburse the students’ some of their costs for the trip. The students have asked for privacy.  Walsh, which is assembling a team to monitor COVID-19 developments, already has canceled its planned student trip to Guadalajara, Mexico, which was to take place over spring break and involved nine students.  Hosler said the two Walsh students who have been studying in Mexico with the university’s partner institution since January have been given the option to return home but they have chosen to stay. No decision has been made on whether the university’s summer global learning experiences will proceed, she said.  According to the CDC, the risk of contracting the coronavirus in the United States remains low and no confirmed cases in Ohio have been reported.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren and the Sierra Club, among other activists, are saying such a move is tantamount to the EPA eliminating the country’s “bedrock environmental and public health laws.”  Warren’s criticisms came a month after the Democrat suggested in March that the government cancel federal student loan payments for the duration of the health crisis.  The Environmental Protection Agency called out Sen. Elizabeth Warren and the Sierra Club on Monday for suggesting the agency is using the virus as cover to allow energy producers to nix regulations.  EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler is effectively eliminating the country’s “bedrock environmental and public health laws,” Warren said. The Sierra Club is jumping on board as well, pushing a petition asking activists to call out President Donald Trump for supposedly gutting regulations.  The EPA is dismissing Warren and the Sierra Club’s characterization, calling the claims “false.”  “EPA’s enforcement authority and responsibility remains active and does not allow for any increases in emissions,” EPA spokeswoman Andrea Woods told the Daily Caller News Foundation.  She added: “It is not a nationwide waiver of environmental rules,” before noting that the agency will continue working to ensure regulations are met. EPA gave manufacturers leniency in March to help those that are struggling with compliance amid a pandemic that has killed more than 150,000 people worldwide and nearly 40,000 in the United States.  “We’re in a state of national emergency, but the Trump administration isn’t going to let any good crisis go to waste,” the group noted in an AddUp campaign, which asks activists to send a letter to the EPA demanding the agency do more to administer environmental rules.  “[W]heeler has ordered his agency to stop enforcing basic environmental safeguards,” the Sierra Club wrote before adding: “Yes, that means polluters can pollute as much as they want with no restrictions, and no protections for you, your family, and your community.”  A bipartisan group of attorneys general also got in on the act. Wisconsin AG Josh Kaul and 13 other AGs explained their concern in a letter Thursday to Wheeler, who eased some rules in March on energy companies and manufacturing plants to help them cope with economic lockdowns.  “We will continue to enforce our state environmental laws in a reasonable manner, and stand ready to hold regulated entities accountable under critical federal environmental laws if EPA will not,” Kaul and the other state law enforcement officers wrote.  Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, etched out a similar argument in an April 3 letter to Wheeler. (RELATED: Trump’s EPA Deals Blow To Regulation Conservatives Say Drove Obama’s So-Called War On Coal)  “Despite the global focus on combating the pandemic, agencies throughout the Trump administration appear determined to use this crisis to advance President Trump’s ‘agenda of environmental deregulation,'” Warren and Sen. Ed Markey wrote, citing The New York Times’ reporting. The Massachusetts Democrat added that the EPA should react on a case-by-case basis.  However, the EPA makes clear in the directive that the shift is temporary and restricted only to certain manufacturers hit hard by coronavirus, or COVID-19.  “At the EPA, we are cognizant of potential worker shortages due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” the agency noted. It stated in the directive that such policies are based on individual cases.  “The consequences of the pandemic may affect facility operations and the availability of key staff and contractors and the ability of laboratories to timely analyze samples and provide results,” the EPA stated before noting that such limitations will make it hard to comply with a slate of rules.  The EPA also lists several conditions required before the agency provides leniency.  Facilities that are obligated to comply with rules should “act responsibly under the circumstances” during the pandemic, “identify the specific nature and dates of noncompliance,” and “identify how COVID-19 was the cause of the noncompliance.”  Reasons for noncompliance must also be documented, according to the directive.  Meanwhile, other federal agencies are easing up on regulations to help lubricate action amid the virus’s spread. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for instance, issued a policy in February allowing laboratories to more quickly develop diagnostic tests spotting the virus.  Warren, for her part, proposed in March to cancel federal student loan payments for the duration of the health crisis. Her proposal would require the government to make the monthly payments for everyone with federal student loans.

Normally used when patients are far away or unable to travel due to the weather, virtual visits have increased 10- to 20-fold in recent weeks, said Dr. Lee Schwamm, a Massachusetts General Hospital neurologist, director of MGH’s Center for TeleHealth, and vice president of virtual care for Partners HealthCare.  “The current crisis makes virtual care solutions like telehealth an indispensable tool as COVID-19 spreads across U.S. communities,” Schwamm said. “I believe it can help flatten the curve of infections and help us to deploy medical staff and lifesaving equipment wisely.”  Boston Medical Center launched telehealth visits on March 16, and within 48 hours went from almost zero to 1,500 scheduled, said Dr. Rebecca Grochow Mishuris, an internal medicine physician and associate chief medical information officer at BMC.  “Before the pandemic, we were doing almost no telemedicine,” Grochow Mishuris said. “(But) we have made a concerted effort to reduce the number of patients coming to our facility for ambulatory visits … to reduce the risk to our patients and to ourselves.”  Telemedicine also has freed up doctors and nurses to focus on emergency and urgent cases, she said, and to attend to patients who become seriously ill from COVID-19 after showing symptoms including fever, dry cough and shortness of breath.  “We are all now living in an uncertain time and doing our best not to overwhelm the health care system,” Grochow Mishuris said. “At Boston Medical Center, it is up to the physician as to whether to do appointments by phone or video, and the patient is allowed to decline.”  Patients’ insurance should cover telehealth visits, she said, and their co-pays remain the same.

Gavin Newsom’s plan to make stimulus payments to illegal immigrants to help them out during the coronavirus crisis.

A judge rejected that request.  The state praised the ruling.  “California is taking legally and morally justified action to assist all Californians impacted by COVID-19,” said Scott Murray, deputy director of public affairs for the California Department of Social Services.  Mr. Newsom has earmarked $75 million in state money to go specifically to illegal immigrants. He’s also working with a charity to collect another $50 million.  The Democratic governor says that will cover 150,000 payments. He’s also working with a charity that’s trying to raise another $50 million to supplement the state’s funds.  Judicial Watch says federal law requires state legislatures to enact legislation to grant benefits to illegal immigrants. The conservative public interest law firm, which sued on behalf of two state taxpayers, said Mr. Newsom’s independent move violates that standard.  Judicial Watch said the judge agreed Mr. Newsom didn’t have the authority to spend the money, but rejected the temporary restraining order because there was an immediate public interest in getting the money out the door quickly during the coronavirus crisis.  “It is astonishing that a court would allow a public official to ignore the law and spend tax money with no legal authority,” said Tom Fitton, the group’s president, who vowed an appeal.

While the anxiety is high for everyone, we recognize these conditions may be especially hard for our tenure-track colleagues.  Yesterday, the deans of Harvard's schools discussed the situation and agreed we feel it is important to provide relief. Each school will move forward with a plan that reflects their unique circumstances and context. After conversation with Kathleen McGinn, Gary Pisano, and Valerie Porciello, we have decided that at HBS, all Assistant and Associate Professors who are not currently under review will be granted an automatic clock and contract extension of one year. Thus, for these faculty members, their next scheduled review will take place one year later than planned, and the end date of their appointment will be pushed out by one year. Anyone who wishes to come up earlier (e.g., on their original schedule) of course will be able to do so.  We will send all affected tenure-track faculty members a letter extending their contracts and providing additional details later this spring. For now, we wanted to reassure everyone that their careers will not be affected adversely by the coronavirus crisis and the challenges it is causing.  Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.   Best,   Nitin   ---------------------------------------   From: Dean Claudine Gay  Date: Thu, Mar 19, 2020 at 2:52 PM  Subject: Promotion Reviews and Appointment Extensions   To:  Dear FAS Tenure-Track Faculty Colleagues,  I write to offer what I hope will be welcome news regarding timing for reviews for promotion to associate professor or to tenured professor.  The FAS (including SEAS) is offering to current FAS tenure-track faculty options for extending appointments and postponing promotion reviews, according to the following eligibility guidelines.   Associate professors:  Current FAS associate professors whose review for promotion to tenure is scheduled to begin in Fall 2020 or later may, if they wish, have their tenure review postponed by one year and their current associate professor contract extended by one year.  Current FAS associate professors whose tenure review was scheduled to begin in Spring 2020 (and whose review may or may not have already begun) may, if they wish, opt to have their tenure review postponed until Fall 2020 and their current associate professor contract extended by one additional semester, i.e., until June 30, 2022.  Current FAS associate professors whose tenure review began in Fall 2019 and is still in progress will continue their review as scheduled and are not eligible for this option of an appointment extension and review postponement.  Current FAS associate professors whose tenure review has been completed are not eligible for an extension of their associate professor contract.   Assistant professors:  Current FAS assistant professors whose review for promotion to associate professor is scheduled to begin in Fall 2020 or later may, if they wish, have their associate review postponed by one year and their current assistant professor contract extended by one year.  Current FAS assistant professors whose associate review was scheduled to begin in Spring 2020 (and whose review may or may not have already begun) will continue their review as scheduled and may, if they wish, and if their review is successful, opt to have their associate professor appointment extended by one year.  Current FAS assistant professors whose associate review began in Fall 2019 and is still in progress will continue their review as scheduled and may, if they wish, and if their review is successful, opt to have their associate professor appointment extended by one year.  Individuals whose associate review began in Fall 2019 and was completed with a successful outcome of promotion to associate professor, may, if they wish, opt to have their associate professor appointment extended by one year.  We are offering these options because we recognize that the coronavirus has significantly disrupted academic and personal life, including the transition to remote teaching, the ramping-down of research laboratories, the closure of K-12 schools in Massachusetts, changes in childcare arrangements, and restrictions on travel. I know that these circumstances have an impact on your time and productivity in doing research, building your teaching portfolio, developing your roles as advisors, mentors, and Harvard citizens, and otherwise advancing your professional careers. In addition, once circumstances become more favorable, I know that many of you would appreciate the extra time to restart your research enterprises and to bring them back to full capacity.  If you are eligible for an appointment extension and/or postponement of your review, your assistant dean from the academic divisions or SEAS will soon send you a letter that will describe the options available to you and will ask you to indicate your preference for an extension and/or review postponement. If you wish to have an appointment extension and/or review postponement, you must indicate this in writing to your assistant dean by June 30, 2020.  I recognize that, once you come up for review, you may want it to be clear to external reviewers that the timing of your review was extended due to the coronavirus situation. We plan to insert new language into the templates used for soliciting feedback from external reviewers to make this fact clear.  I hope that this plan will allow you to focus on your teaching for the rest of the semester. Ensuring that we continue to deliver on our educational mission will take flexibility and imagination. I appreciate the calm leadership that I know you will show our students.  In the midst of these difficult times, I hope that this news brings some relief. I know that you are adjusting to many changes, in all areas of life. I am grateful to each of you for persevering in our shared mission.

Nala is one of 35 dogs and cats that have been placed with Omaha-area families as part of an emergency foster care program.\"I just felt like, with all the virus stuff going on, it just seemed like a need we could help with,\" Simeon said. \"We're all quarantined anyway. I mean, what a perfect opportunity to do something good.\"Amid an avalanche of bad news, Simeon's story and thousands like it across the country are prompting smiles as suddenly isolated people rush to care for animals, easing a burden on shelters and providing homes - even if just temporarily - for homeless dogs, cats and other pets.Shelters from California to New York have put out the call for people to temporarily foster pets. Thanks to an overwhelming response from people who suddenly found themselves stuck at home, shelters say they have placed record numbers of dogs, cats and other animals. If past trends hold, many of those who agree to temporarily care for a pet will ultimately decide they want the animal to stay for good.\"We have a waiting list of 2,000 people wanting to foster,\" said Dr. Apryl Steele, president and CEO of Dumb Friends League shelter in Denver. It's the largest animal shelter in the Rocky Mountain region, caring for an average of 22,000 animals a year.Steele said the initial push there to foster animals came not from the shelter, but the community.\"We had people reaching out to us all of a sudden,\" she said. \"People just wanted to do something to help. We realized pretty quickly that we could soon be facing a shutdown of our adoptions and got on board.\"Shelters have several reasons for pushing to foster out animals, Steele said, including the fear that they might have to stop adopting out animals if people can't visit them or that they might see an influx of people surrendering animals amid economic woes. But the overriding factor, she said, was concern for workers' health.\"We need to get to a skeleton staff, stat. We can't do that if the shelter is full,\" she said.Stephanie Filer, spokeswoman for Animal Rescue League of Iowa also noted that shelters are seeing a drop in donations - a normal occurrence during an economic downturn. The Des Moines-based organization and others have also had to cancel fundraising events because of virus containment efforts.The good news is that when Filer's group put out a call for temporary homes for at least 80 cats in their care, it received some 160 applications within 12 hours. She noted that 60% to 70% of people who foster an animal opt to keep the animal permanently.\"A crisis brings out the worst in people and the best in people, so we are thrilled to see some exciting things come from this awful situation,\" she said.Since mid-March, the San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has seen 1,600 people volunteer to foster, and the Oregon Humane Society in Portland has seen 1,000 new foster volunteers.The outpouring comes at a critical time because animals produce lots of litters in the spring, said Dr. Jennifer Scarlett, president of the San Francisco SPCA.\"You have shelter leaders around the country who are just looking at this tidal wave that is coming our way,\" Scarlett said.In Washington, D.C., the Humane Rescue Alliance said more than 1,000 people signed up to foster in a 10-day period this month.One of those was first-time foster volunteer Katie Lee, who is now caring for Calvin, a 2-year-old terrier mix. A move to working from home during the coronavirus scare prompted her decision, because \"at least I'm home a lot.\"Ina Offret, of Anchorage, Alaska, agreed to foster 10-year-old Kelsey after a local shelter called saying it had no room for more animals and was desperate to clear space. Kelsey, a poodle mix, joined Offret's poodle Suzie.If she had been asked a month ago if she was ready to take in another dog, Offret said, she would have politely declined, noting she had had three dogs under her roof until last year, when old age took the other two.\"I had reached a point in my life when I decided I don't want multiple dogs,\" Offret said. \"Then the coronavirus hit.\"Offret said she hasn't changed her mind about wanting to be a single-dog family, but said Kelsey has a home until another family can be found.\"I'm going to keep her until whenever that is,\" Offret said.

It is a shock to all of us, players, people involved in the sport, fans, and lovers of the sport. It is a shock to the system but what we are going through is nothing in the grand scheme of things,\" he added.  Tom also admitted that the chances of getting a break like this are very less so each player needs to utilise it properly.  \"I'm using it as a time to get refreshed mentally. It is a terrible time of course, but we seldom get a break like this in what would be the middle of our summer. We are trying to stay positive so that when we do come back we're in a good position to kick on mentally and physically for the years to come,\" Tom said.  Amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) had also announced measures to protect jobs, including salary cuts \"ranging between 25 percent to 10 percent\".  Earlier, the board decided to suspend all professional cricket till May 28 due to COVID-19.  The UK has so far recorded 12,107 deaths as a result of the coronavirus.

Despite the surge, Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the health system had been coping but warned of the dangers facing seniors in nursing homes.  \"The fact that Canada's fatality rate is at one per cent indicates that the health care system is not currently overwhelmed,\" Tam said. \"These fatalities could be reduced further by preventing the illness in our most vulnerable population.\"  New infections and deaths were reported across the country. A 91-year-old man in a seniors home became the eighth person in Quebec to succumb to COVID-19, authorities said. Premier Francois Legault reported 1,629 confirmed cases, up by 290. Ontario reported 170 new cases, pushing its total closer to 900 — along with six deaths since Wednesday. Fifteen people have died.  The pandemic, which is taxing the health-care system, has idled large swaths of the work force in a matter of days. Claims for employment insurance benefits have skyrocketed.  To ease the financial devastation, governments across the country have opened the money taps. They've also urged creditors to go easy on those suddenly unable to make rent or other payments.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the federal government was asking banks and credit card companies to lower interest rates for financially struggling Canadians. The government was also looking at extending lower-interest credit directly to consumers, Trudeau said on Thursday.  Parliament on Wednesday approved the flow of $52 billion in direct financial aid to Canadians and another $55 billion in tax deferrals. Still, it could be weeks before needy recipients start getting cash in their hands.  The grim situation was being seen around the globe, with more than half a million people identified as infected and about 23,000 deaths reported. Italy has seen more than 8,000 deaths and the United States has reported close to 70,000 cases, about 1,000 fatal. China, where the virus is believed to have originated, has gradually begun returning to normal.  Frantic efforts to develop a vaccination or cure are ongoing around the world and experts are warning about the risks of unproven treatments. British Columbia's College of Pharmacists urged health professionals to resist demands for access to anti-viral or anti-malaria drugs not proven safe or effective for treating the virus infection.  If therapies such as the anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine are prescribed outside of a clinical trial, pharmacists have been instructed not to fill the prescription, the college said.  COVID-19 is highly contagious and can strike anyone, although it is older people and those with less optimum health who are most at risk of succumbing to the flu-like illness, experts say. People can also infect others without showing any signs themselves.  Government and health authorities repeated their pleas for people to keep their distance from others and to wash hands frequently, with fines or jail threatened for those violating rules to self-isolate or avoid larger gatherings.  Activists pressed concerns about the difficulties facing the homeless. The closure of coffee shops and drop-in centres has only made it harder for those without homes to wash their hands and keep their distances from others. Vancouver said it would open two emergency centres downtown for homeless people.  Grocery Gateway, which delivers supermarket goods ordered online in and around Toronto, said one of its drivers has tested positive for COVID-19. The company, which bills itself as Canada’s largest online grocery delivery service, said it had alerted customers who had contact with the driver over the past 14 days.  For those returning to Canada, a mandatory 14-day quarantine is now in effect. Scofflaws face a maximum $750,000 in fines or six months in jail. Tam said random checks including home visits, would be done to ensure people abide by the quarantine law.  Trudeau said he was talking to the United States about ensuring the Canada-U.S. border remains free of military presence. The U.S. was reported as considering troop deployment to its northern border to thwart irregular border crossers, something the Trudeau government said was essentially a domestic American decision.

He said mistakes were made, but he denied other allegations.\"We were accused of three things,\" he said. \"One of them is true, which was a very minor thing. It was a genuine mistake and something we will never do again...To be very honest with you, this is my first pandemic. And I believe it is for you as well.\"Between March 25 and April 8, Singh allegedly received deliveries at his retail store and warehouse of 40 shipments of disposable face masks weighing more than 1.6 tons, 14 shipments of disposable surgical gowns weighing more than 2.2 tons, six shipments of hand sanitizer weighing more than 1.8 tons and seven shipments of digital thermometers weighing approximately 253 pounds.\"As charged in the complaint, Singh's amassing of critical personal protective equipment during a public health crisis and reselling at huge markups places him squarely in the cross-hairs of law enforcement armed with the Defense Production Act,\" United States Attorney Richard Donoghue said. \"This office is working tirelessly in coordination with the COVID-19 Hoarding and Price Gouging Task Force to prevent a pandemic of greed by profiteers.\"These and other items - some of which had been officially designated as scarce - were advertised and sold at Singh's retail store at prices far in excess of prevailing market prices. For example, records obtained during a judicially-authorized search of the store indicate that three-ply disposable face masks that Singh purchased for a per-unit price of $0.07 were resold by Singh for a per-unit price of $1.00 - a markup of approximately 1,328 percent. The seized records also reveal that Singh completed bulk sales at inflated prices to organizations serving vulnerable senior citizens and children battling the virus.On April 5, Nassau County fined Singh's store for allegedly selling N95 masks that were not actually N95 certified and selling them at an inflated price.On April 14, Postal Inspectors executed a search warrant at Sigh's retail store and a consensual search of the warehouse and seized 23 pallets containing more than 100,000 face masks, 10,000 surgical gowns, nearly 2,500 full-body isolation suits and more than 500,000 pairs of disposable gloves.

Lebanon says it won’t play PIAA tournament game vs. Eastern Pa. team because of coronavirus   By:  Wednesday, March 11, 2020 | 12:46 PM  Christopher Horner | Tribune-Review Mt. Lebanon boys basketball coach Joe David calls a play during a game against Upper St. Clair.  Mt. Lebanon School District administrators, concerned about coronavirus, informed the PIAA that its boys basketball team wouldn’t participate in Wednesday night’s playoff game against Eastern Pa. opponent Cheltenham.  As a result, the PIAA postponed the second-round game until 7 p.m. Thursday at Chambersburg to give the PIAA “some time to evaluate all the information being provided by both schools and the (Pennsylvania) Department of Health,” PIAA executive director Bob Lombardi said.  However, Mt. Lebanon seems unlikely to play Thursday either.  The school district sought advice from the Allegheny County Health Department, which advised the team not to participate in Wednesday’s game, according to a letter athletic director John Grogan sent to parents. The team won’t compete unless the ACHD considered it safe, said Mt. Lebanon spokesperson Cissy Bowman.  Cheltenham, a suburban Philadelphia school district in Montgomery County, announced Monday that its building would be closed through Friday for deep cleaning and disinfecting. Cheltenham administrators said the action was taken because a district parent was the caregiver to a patient with a presumptive case of covid-19.  In his letter to parents, Grogan said: “The health and well-being of our students, staff, and community are of the utmost importance to us. After fully considering the totality of the information our District received from the Cheltenham School District, we consulted with the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) who advised the district not to participate in the game.  “After speaking to the PIAA leadership, the Mt. Lebanon School District administration has made the decision to not send our team, coaches, and other personnel to compete in the game,” Grogan added. “In that we cannot ensure the health and safety of our students, coaches, and community, the District administration could see no other viable scenario to permit our team’s participation.”  There are 15 presumptive positive or confirmed cases of coronavirus in Pennsylvania, according to the Pa. Department of Health. Nine are in Montgomery County.  Cheltenham has no intentions of forfeiting, athletic director Suni Blackwell said.  “In collaboration with the PIAA, the district stands firm on wanting the game to go on as planned,” Blackwell said in an email. “The decisions made with regard to covid-19 had nothing to do with students or faculty being exposed. Though we weren’t mandated to, in an abundance of caution, we decided we’d take a number of days to engage in deep cleaning and follow CDC’s recommendation of sanitizing high-contact areas. While engaged in deep cleaning, the district has also been creating the foundation for our staff to support a quality remote learning experience.  “We have no intention of withdrawing from this tournament and will follow PIAA bylaws,” Blackwell added. “Though Mt. Lebanon has stated its refusal to play, Cheltenham will not be forfeiting.”   Mt. Lebanon statement  “Our boys basketball team was scheduled to compete against Cheltenham High School’s team on Wednesday, March 11 in Chambersburg as part of the PIAA playoff structure. The Cheltenham School District recently released information about their response to the covid-19 virus because of exposure within their community.  “To reduce or mitigate the possible exposure to their students and staff, the Superintendent of the Cheltenham School District communicated to his community that the Cheltenham School District has closed its schools for the week, suspended field trips through April 13, and are prohibiting outside groups from utilizing its facilities. Although the Cheltenham School District deemed it appropriate to continue participation in the PIAA playoff structure, the Mt. Lebanon School District does not under these circumstances.  “The health and well-being of our students, staff, and community are of the utmost importance to us. After fully considering the totality of the information our District received from the Cheltenham School District, we consulted with the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) who advised the District not to participate in the game.

In that we cannot ensure the health and safety of our students, coaches, and community, the District administration could see no other viable scenario to permit our team’s participation.  “The District has communicated its position to the PIAA and is awaiting its response. It is our position that our team should not be disqualified from this game and tournament.  “We extend our support to the Cheltenham School District as it is reported to be dealing with an evolving covid-19 situation.”  Chris Harlan is a Tribune-Review Staff Writer.

Governments have locked down commerce, beefed up health care measures and earmarked billions of euros into Europe's famed safety nets to cushion the economic blow to businesses and blue-collar workers alike from measures meant to contain the virus.  But trimmed commuter train schedules at Atocha, the main gateway into the Spanish capital for the working classes, meant that huge crowds formed on the platforms, defeating the government's appeal for 'social distancing.\" Layoffs looming and real meant that those who still had work reported for duty - with or without protective masks - even if they would have preferred to stay home.  'I fear the coronavirus, but I fear more not being able to pay the utility bills,' said Mari Carmen Ramírez, 55, who was commuting to her 950-euro ($1,100) a month job as an office cleaner. 'When this is all over, how are we going to eat?'  As European governments pass sweeping spending measures to address the pandemic, they are being called on to look out for the workers who are not only losing their jobs - the waitresses and tour guides, hairdressers and hotel maids - but those who still must show up because they can't work from home. Europe's famed safety nets are being stretched thin, at a time when many economies were already skirting recession and wealth gaps have grown.   Will it be enough?  Governments from Prague to Paris, Lisbon to London are deferring tax payments, approving short-term unemployment schemes and paid sick leave to cover even those in preventive quarantine. Hardest-hit Italy approved 25 billion euros in measures, including vouchers for babysitters. The Czech government offered a 750-euro stipend for students studying abroad who opt to stay abroad through Easter. Denmark said it would pay 75% of employees' salaries if companies promise not to fire staff.  \"This epidemic will be a catastrophe for all countries of the world,\" warned French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire in announcing 45 billion euros ($50 billion) in aid for small businesses on top of the tens of billions already promised for individuals forced to stop working because of workplace closures.  'The shock will be violent.'  In Spain, now in second place in Europe after Italy in terms of infections, the left-wing coalition government is set to announce its economic measures Tuesday.  Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is under pressure to increase government spending and announce subsidies and significant tax cuts to cushion the blow that has already seen German carmaker Volkswagen's Spanish unit temporarily lay off more than 14,000 from its Martorell plant, near Barcelona. The company said the workers would be paid 80% of their wages until they are re-hired. More than 100,000 workers were affected by similar temporary layoff schemes across industries, Spain's Cinco Días business newspaper calculated.  Spain is still feeling the aftereffects of the global financial crisis. While the percentage of people classified as economically vulnerable - those who are poor, face high debt or unemployment - inched down from 29% in 2013 to 26% in 2017, it is still much higher than the European Union average of 22%.  'I have no gloves, no mask, but supermarkets are to remain open, we have been told,' said G�nesis Suárez, a 25-year-old supermarket clerk who commutes from Atocha and whose father was fired from his construction job on Friday.  'With my father at home, I need to contribute to the family's cashbox. We are still going to receive the electricity bill at the end of the month, aren't we?'  The initial aid measures by governments and central banks focused on keeping the financial system running with interest rate cuts and injections of cash for banks.  Governments have also pledged loans. Germany is offering at least 460 billion euros ($513 billion) in guarantees and like several other countries expanded a short-term work program that was successfully used during the 2008 financial crisis, helping companies keep people on the payroll.  But again those measures help companies and are not addressing the needs of the most vulnerable: the poor but also manual laborers like cleaners and contractors without a fixed salary.  'We have about 50% slump in food collection,' said Sabine Werth, head of the 'Berliner Tafel' food bank in the German capital, where donations are drying up. Already seven of the food bank's 45 distribution points have closed, depriving the neediest of food close to home.  While some governments, like those of France and Denmark, have promised to guarantee the majority of individuals' salaries, detail on how they will do that is still largely unclear - though urgent.  Jim O'Neill, the former chief economist at Goldman Sachs who is now chair of the U.K.-based Chatham House think tank, said cash should be funnelled directly to people.  That would be an evolution of the monetary stimulus central banks have been providing since the global financial crisis 12 years ago, in which they injected newly printed money into the banking system.  'At the core of these views is the notion of giving money to people, especially lower income people, directly paid for by our central banks printing money,' he said in a note. 'Until recently, I found myself having very little sympathy with these views but, as a result of COVID-19, I have changed my mind.'  Governments, meanwhile, are bolstering and broadening existing safety nets.  Britain will ensure workers are entitled to the legal minimum sick pay from the first day of illness rather than from day four. It's unlikely to be enough, however, since the legal minimum is a mere 94.25 pounds ($115) a week.  An analysis by the Resolution Foundation think tank in Britain suggested that a typical self-employed worker could see income fall by three-quarters if forced into quarantine, while a typical worker eligible for the legal minimum would lose over two-thirds of normal pay.  Governments are also postponing the payment of taxes, social insurance and mortgages and offering extra paid leave, though the measures appear to be piecemeal.  ''Many Italians are in the front-line trenches: in the hospitals, in the factories and in the pharmacies, behind the cash registers at the supermarkets,\" Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte said in a national address.  ''No one will be abandoned,'' he vowed.  The workers reporting for the night shift at the Tenaris steel plant in Bergamo, Italy, felt more than abandoned. They felt terrified. They had been demanding for over a week to be allowed to take vacation rather than continue working with coronavirus claiming more infections in the province of Bergamo than anywhere else in Italy.  Factories had been exempted from the government's March 11 shutdown decree, meaning the blue-collar workers of Italy's industrial heartland were forced to report for duty. Last week, workers at plants across Italy began going on strike or threatening to do so.  'We were really afraid, to be sitting side-by-side for eight hours without knowing what the conditions were,' Tenaris steelworker Giambattista Morali said. 'The company disinfected and gave us some more masks, but it wasn't enough because we couldn't guarantee that we'd be working one meter apart.'  While many people suffer relatively mild symptoms from the virus, the mortality rate has been particularly high in Italy, thanks in part to its elderly population.  The same health concerns abounded this week at the Atocha station, where railway officials weren't doing anything to distance commuters jostling to catch their trains.  'What is this?' wondered Antonio Galiano, a 38-year-old commuter. 'Be serious, please, it's our lives that are at stake.'   ___  Winfield reported from Rome.

Vincente Fusco died Thursday at CentraState Medical Center in Freehold, one day after his mother and brother died of the virus, Roseann Paradiso Fodera, a cousin and lawyer representing the Fusco family, told NJ.com. His sister died days before.  Grace Fusco, 73, a mother of 11 from Freehold, died Wednesday at CentraState Medical Center. Her son, Carmine Fusco, a New York- and New Jersey-based horse racing trainer, died that same day at St. Luke’s University Hospital-Bethlehem Campus in Pennsylvania. Both had tested positive for the coronavirus.  NEW JERSEY WOMAN WHO TESTED POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS REMAINS 'AT LARGE' AFTER GIVING FALSE NAME, ADDRESS  Her daughter, 55-year-old Rita Fusco-Jackson, died last Friday at the hospital in New Jersey. She tested positive for the coronavirus after her death, which deemed her the second person in New Jersey to die from a COVID-19 illness. She was a parishioner and a confirmation teacher in the Co-Cathedral of St. Robert Bellarmine.  “To imagine a week ago to get a phone call like this — if someone told me this story, I wouldn’t believe it,\" Roseann Paradiso Fodera, a cousin serving as the family’s attorney, told NJ.com. “It’s inconceivable to me.”  Three other family members remained hospitalized in critical condition as of Wednesday, reports said. Nineteen additional relatives, including spouses and children of those hospitalized, have been tested for the coronavirus and have quarantined themselves in their separate homes before results become available.  “This has been devastating for all of us,” Elizabeth Fusco, 42, of Freehold, said before her brother and mother’s deaths. “Our hearts are broken over losing our sister, Rita. We just need help in saving our family members with life-saving medication.”  It is believed the novel virus spread between relatives at a recent family gathering on March 10.  The family had ties to the first person to die after becoming infected with the coronavirus in New Jersey – a man named John Brennan, a horse trainer who lived in Little Ferry, NJ.com reported.

About 100 research groups are pursuing vaccines with nearly a dozen in early stages of human trials or poised to start. It’s a crowded field, but researchers say that only increases the odds that a few might overcome the many obstacles that remain.  “We’re not really in a competition against each other. We’re in a race against a pandemic virus, and we really need as many players in that race as possible,” Dr. Andrew Pollard, who is leading the University of Oxford’s vaccine study, told The Associated Press.  The hard truth: There’s no way to predict which - if any - vaccine will work safely, or even to name a front-runner.  As Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government’s top expert, put it: “You need more shots on goal for a chance at getting a safe and effective vaccine.”  The first cautious tests of March, when small numbers of volunteers got injections to check for side effects, have turned into larger studies in China, the U.S. and Europe to look for hints that different vaccine candidates really protect.  Next: Finding out for sure if any of the vaccines work in the real world by testing large groups of people in areas where the virus is circulating - a tricky prospect when study participants may be in places where the virus is fading or they are told to stay home - and finding a way to quickly distribute lots of doses of any successful candidates.  Policymakers are devising plans to try to overcome both obstacles in an attempt to compress the years it usually takes to develop a vaccine. Asked if a vaccine by January was possible, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator, told Fox News Sunday “on paper, it’s possible. It’s whether we can execute,” she said.  Fauci has cautioned that even if everything goes perfectly, 12 to 18 months to develop a vaccine would set a speed record - and January will mark a year since the National Institutes of Health began creating its own COVID-19 vaccine, now in trials with Moderna Inc.  MULTIPLE SHOTS WORK IN MULTIPLE WAYS  Depending how you count, there are between eight and 11 vaccine candidates in early stages of testing in China, the U.S., Britain and Germany - a collaboration between Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech last week began a study in Germany that’s simultaneously testing four somewhat different shots. More study sites are about to open in still other countries - and between May and July another handful of different vaccines is set to begin first-in-human testing.  There’s no shortage of volunteers.  “This allows me to play a small role in fighting this thing,” said Anthony Campisi, 33, of Philadelphia, who received his first test dose of Inovio Pharmaceuticals’ DNA-based vaccine at the University of Pennsylvania last month. “I can be a guinea pig.”  The initial vaccine candidates work in a variety of ways. That’s important because if one type fails, maybe another won’t.  Different types of vaccines work better in some virus families than others. But for coronaviruses, there’s no blueprint. Back in 2003 when scientists attempted vaccines against SARS, a cousin of the new virus, animal studies hinted at safety problems but then SARS disappeared and vaccine funding dried up. Vaccines against another COVID-19 cousin named MERS have only reached first-step safety testing.  “In 20/20 hindsight, we should have worked harder on coronavirus vaccines back then,” said Dr. Sten Vermund, dean of the Yale School of Public Health. Now, “we’re obligated to try a variety of strategies if we want fast results.”   PROS AND CONS  China’s Sinovac and SinoPharm are testing “inactivated” vaccines, made by growing the new coronavirus and killing it. The companies have revealed little information about how the shots differ. But the technology is tried-and-true - polio shots and some types of flu vaccine are inactivated virus - although it’s hard to scale up to rapidly produce millions of doses.  Most other vaccines in the pipeline aim to train the immune system to recognize a piece of the new coronavirus - mostly, the spiky protein that studs its outer surface.  One way: Use a harmless virus to carry the spike protein into the body. It’s easier to produce but determining which virus is the best “carrier” is a key question. China’s CanSino Biologics brewed its vaccine using a common cold-causing adenovirus, engineered so it won’t spread in the body. And in case people’s immune systems fight off the cold virus before the vaccine can do its job, Pollard’s Oxford team instead chose an adenovirus that normally infects chimpanzees.  Another way: Inject a piece of the coronavirus genetic code that instructs the body itself to produce spike protein that in turn primes the immune system to attack. It’s a new and unproven technology but one that promises even faster production. Vaccines made by NIH and Moderna, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, and that Pfizer-BioNtech collaboration use genetic code approaches.  Still more methods are next in line: Vaccine made of spike protein nanoparticles, and even a nasal spray alternative to shots.   PROVING THEY WORK  Most vaccine studies so far are tracking safety and whether volunteers’ blood shows any immune reactions. Some have jumped to larger numbers quickly, but there’s still concern about being able to prove real-world protection.  If study participants are holed up at home or live in areas where the virus has quit spreading rapidly, then too few may get sick for scientists to tell if the vaccine or social distancing was what protected them. The Oxford study, for example, will track about 1,000 people, half given the real vaccine. But the team plans a later-stage study with another 5,000 volunteers for a final answer and knows it might have to move to other countries.  “When you’re chasing a pandemic, the place that looks like the right one to go to today will be the wrong place two weeks from now. And that makes it really difficult,” Pollard said.  In the U.S., some lawmakers have urged a different and controversial experiment: Recruit young, healthy volunteers who agree to be deliberately infected with the new coronavirus to prove if a vaccine protects them. But some healthy adults do die from COVID-19 - and until doctors better understand why, that so-called “challenge study” makes for a risky proposition with serious ethical questions, Yale’s Vermund noted.  The World Health Organization last week called for countries to offer to be test sites for an international project that will speed the timeline by admitting on a rolling basis promising vaccine candidates for further study in locations where COVID-19 remains widespread at the time.  In the U.S., the Trump administration is planning its own project dubbed Operation Warp Speed that will overlap studies of “different candidates that are made differently and act differently,” Birx said.  If early evidence was strong enough and the virus is still widespread, the Food and Drug Administration might even consider emergency use of a vaccine before final test results were in, Dr. Peter Marks, who directs the FDA office that oversees vaccines, recently told reporters.   SUPPLYING THE WORLD  Whenever the first useful vaccine is identified, there won’t be enough for everyone. So a growing number of vaccine makers say they’re already starting to brew tons of doses - wasting millions of dollars if they bet on the wrong candidate but shaving a few months off mass vaccinations if their choice pans out.  “We need to start building new manufacturing sites now,” said Wellcome Trust vaccine chief Charlie Weller. “And we need to accept that some of these sites will be created for vaccines that will ultimately fail.”  It’s not just a gamble for shareholders. The U.S. government already has deals with Moderna and Johnson & Johnson that together total nearly $1 billion and include scaling up production.  “The critical thing at the beginning is just to make as much stuff as we can,” said Dr. Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, which is funding several COVID-19 vaccine attempts around the world.  Even if one works, expect rationing early on as policymakers determine who most needs the first doses - possibly health workers or the elderly - until there’s enough for the world, rich and poor countries alike.  “I am concerned about what I call vaccine nationalism. That’s the tension between obligations elected leaders will feel to protect the lives of their citizens” versus the imperative for equitable global sharing, Hatchett said.  And with billions who’ll need a dose or maybe several, just one winner in this race won’t cut it.  “It’s not likely that one manufacturer or one candidate vaccine is going to be able to deal with the global need and supply that need,” Pollard said.   ___  The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

The COVID-19 outbreak is expected to further exacerbate the weakness in the domestic demand, following significant negative impact on its end consumer industry, real estate sector, given the expected slowdown in project execution and new launches,\" Icra Vice-President and Head, Mid-Corporate ratings Suprio Banerjee said quoting the report.

Icra further stated that along with being the largest producer and consumer of the world, China also is the largest exporter.  India ranked fourth after Spain and Italy, while Iran is fifth largest exporter.  During the fourth quarter of FY20, the tiles export from India witnessed a decent jump due to temporary lockdown in China and other major exporting countries.  India's exports stood close to 20 per cent of its total production.  The top 5 export market for India are Saudi Arabia, UAE, Mexico, Iraq and Oman with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries forming 40-45 per cent of total India's exports.  \"Our channel-check suggests that given the relatively lower impact of coronavirus in India's key export destination, demand recovery in export market will be faster compared to the domestic market,\" Icra said.

But a scary bout of COVID-19 that began last month with headaches and fevers, progressed to breathing problems and led to a hospital visit has now left him eager to disclose as much as possible to help halt the virus’ spread.  Karosis has already shared personal details with Massachusetts health investigators. And if he was asked to comply with a disease-tracking phone app that monitored his whereabouts but didn’t publicly reveal his name and Cambridge street address, he said he’d do that, too.  PEYTON, ASHLEY MANNING DONATE HUNDREDS OF MEALS TO TENNESSEE HOSPITAL  “I’m sick and I’m under a quarantine -- hold me accountable for it,” the 27-year-old software salesman said. “You have the potential to kill other people.”  As countries around the world edge toward ending lockdowns and restarting their economies and societies, citizens are being more closely monitored, in nations rich and poor, authoritarian and free.  New systems to track who is infected and who isn’t, and where they’ve been, have been created or extended in China, South Korea and Singapore. And a range of other surveillance systems – some utilizing GPS location data, some gathering medical data – have been debated or piloted in Israel, Germany, the U.K., Italy and elsewhere.  The challenge: achieving the tricky balance between limiting the spread of disease and allowing people freedom to move outside their homes.  Whether the prospect on the table is “immunity passports” or cellphone-based tracking apps, the aim is to protect public health. But experts say it’s also important to avoid a slippery-slope scenario where data collected to minimize the spread of disease is stored indefinitely, available without limits to law enforcement or susceptible to hackers.  GLOBAL COORNAVIRUS CASES SURPASS 2 MILLION MARK  “We need to build necessary guardrails for civil liberties,” said Jake Laperruque, a lawyer at the nonprofit Project on Government Oversight in Washington. “If new data is being collected for public health purposes, it should only be used for public health purposes.”  Right now, there is no single official plan for reopening the United States, where the constitutional system gives states responsibility for maintaining public safety and where deaths from COVID-19 continue to rise steeply.  Scientists believe that the hundreds of thousands of people who already have recovered from the virus worldwide are likely to have some immunity to future infection, but they aren’t sure for how long. To ensure new cases don’t overwhelm hospital capacity, any plans to relax lockdowns will include provisions to track infections.  “The virus is not going away – if we all just come out on a certain date, it will spread widely again,” said Dr. Tom Frieden, an infectious disease expert and former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “That means we need to think carefully about how and when we come out.”  Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House’s top disease expert, said the administration has looked at the idea of issuing certificates of immunity to people whose blood tests reveal they have developed antibodies to fight the virus, among other possible plans. Yet they haven’t concluded that approach would be effective, he told The Associated Press on Tuesday.  “I know people are anxious to say, ‘Well, we’ll give you a passport that says you’re antibody-positive, you can go to work and you’re protected.’ The worst possibility that would happen is if we’re actually wrong about that” and those people get infected.  CORONAVIRUS PATIENTS MAY BE CONTAGIOUS 2 TO 3 DAYS BEFORE SYMPTOMS SHOW, RESEARCH WARNS  Meanwhile, public health agencies from Massachusetts to the city of San Francisco have hired a surge of people to run “contact tracing” teams. Their mission is to identify anyone who has recently been in contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19, then encourage those people to get tested and perhaps isolate themselves. These meetings can be sensitive and require training, and support, to pull off effectively.  Aiming to take the tracing approach to a new scale are tech giants Apple and Google, which are jointly working to build smartphone technology that alerts users if they shared a park bench or grocery store aisle with a stranger later found to be infected with the virus.  Unlike the more invasive location-tracking methods attempted by some governments, the Apple-Google approach uses Bluetooth beacons to detect physical proximity and encrypted keys to maintain people’s anonymity. The companies say they’re building the software for public health departments only, on the condition that they won’t make use of them mandatory.  In addition to developing the technology, experts warn that the implications of deploying such devices need to be carefully considered. Who will collect and verify the data? How long will it be held? Will enough people use a voluntary app for it to be helpful?  “We know from history that ‘emergency measures’ too often last long beyond their initial expiry date,” said Deborah Brown, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.  CHILE COUNTS PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED FROM CORONAVIRUS AS 'RECOVERED' BECAUSE THEY CAN'T INFECT ANYONE ELSE  She also noted that systems that monitor cellphone location or GPS data reveal more than just where someone has recently been. “Your contacts and associations can be gleaned, potentially your religious or political beliefs,” she said -- for instance, if you’ve visited a church or mosque.  Susan Landau, a cybersecurity professor at Tufts University, said she has doubts about the effectiveness of relying on smartphone-based approaches, even if the apps are carefully designed to protect individual privacy.  “My real concern about the whole thing is I think it’s being oversold,” she said. “Does it reduce spread? I don’t doubt that. Does it enable us to eliminate social distancing? No, not as long as there’s a high portion of people who are asymptomatic.”  Collecting data should complement, but not substitute for, well-managed public health interventions, said Deborah Seligsohn, a political scientist at Villanova University.  It’s one thing to merely send a phone alert that someone exposed to a COVID-19 case should self-isolate for 14 days. It’s another to have government workers bring them groceries or other essentials to make that quarantine period possible if someone would otherwise have trouble complying, she said.  After the various lockdowns lift, it’s not clear how readily Americans will submit to tracking efforts.

STATE OFFICIALS SAY THEY HAVE HIRED HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE AND  Advertisement Pennsylvania unemployment system still stressed by virus Share Shares Copy Link Copy  More than a month after Pennsylvania’s unemployment compensation system buckled under the strain of COVID-19, Colleen Angeli has yet to receive a dime -- and May bills are coming due.Angeli, a 60-year-old receptionist from Hershey, is among the record 1.6 million workers who’ve applied for unemployment since mid-March, when the administration of Gov. Tom Wolf began closing nonessential businesses in an effort to slow the spread of the new coronavirus.The business closures unleashed an unprecedented flood of new claims, and the Department of Labor & Industry was unable to keep up. Officials say the claims backlog has been whittled down, but have not revealed how many people have actually received unemployment assistance.Meanwhile, Angeli has yet to receive an identification number from the unemployment office, let alone a determination letter that would tell her she’s been approved or how much she can expect to receive. The most infuriating part is she can’t get anyone on the phone to give her an update. Email isn’t any better -- the agency has a 25-day backlog.“I’m one of those paycheck to paycheck people,” said Angeli, and without unemployment, she’ll have to pick and choose which bills to pay. “If I make my rent payment, I can’t pay my other bills. If I pay my other bills, I can’t pay my rent.”Labor & Industry Secretary Jerry Oleksiak said $3.5 billion in unemployment benefits has been paid out so far, but acknowledged that means little to unemployed workers who haven’t gotten anything yet.“We know that there are people who are frustrated, feeling desperate,” he said. “We want to help them. We are doing all we can as quickly as we can.”Like others around the country, the state’s unemployment office was wholly unprepared for the pandemic, operating with a staff thinned by budget cuts and capable of handling only a relatively small number of claims.Complicating matters is that Pennsylvania relies on a 40-year-old computer system to process unemployment claims -- a system so creaky it can’t easily handle applicants reporting six-figure salaries. A replacement computer system, under development since 2006, has been plagued by delays and cost overruns.The state's chief fiscal watchdog, Auditor General Eugene DePasquale, warned in 2017 that the unemployment office’s mainframe computer was “being held together with bubble gum and rubber bands.” He said Tuesday that while the timing of the pandemic was unforeseeable, it’s been known for years that an economic recession and resulting spike in unemployment claims would overwhelm the system.“I think they did the best they could with the funding they had,\" DePasquale said. \"They needed more help from funding through the budget process to really fix this system. I do believe there are a lot of very dedicated employees there that are dealing with the angry phone calls, doing the best they can. It’s not their fault.”The new claims system is finally projected to launch in October.“We wish we had it before the pandemic started, but timing’s everything,” said Susan Dickinson, director of the state Office of Unemployment Compensation Benefits Policy.On the staffing side, meanwhile, Labor & Industry has brought in hundreds of workers to help answer calls and emails, and hundreds more are being trained, Oleksiak said.Separately, the agency is preparing to administer a new federal benefits program, called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, for self-employed and gig-economy workers and others barred from receiving traditional unemployment. The state has processed more than 100,000 of those claims since the platform went live April 18, but says it won’t be ready to start making payments until early May.Carolyn Butera, an independent contractor who processes real estate transactions, applied for the new unemployment program and is waiting for the money to start flowing. She said people like her were deprived of the ability to earn a living under Wolf’s business shutdown.Those same workers have now gone more than a month without any income, she said.“You left everyone without a job,” Butera said. “How did you not know this many people were going to be filing?”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 20, "positive": 12, "negative": 14, "joy": 1, "anger": 7, "surprise": 1, "fear": 10, "trust": 12}, "metadata": ["unemployment", "stimulus", "pittsburgh", "pandemic", "virus", "wolf", "nonessential", "unprecedented", "labor", "acknowledged", "reporting", "state's", "timing", "economic", "recession", "spike", "funding", "100,000"]}, {"text": "CHICAGO/WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) — At a Wayne Farms chicken processing plant in Alabama, workers recently had to pay the company 10 cents a day to buy masks to protect themselves from the new COVID-19 virus, according to a meat inspector.  In Colorado, nearly a third of the workers at a JBS USA beef plant stayed home amid safety concerns for the last two weeks after a 30-year employee of the facility died following complications from the virus.  And since an Olymel pork plant in Quebec shut on March 29, the number of workers who tested positive for the COVID-19 virus quintupled to more than 50, according to their union.   ADVERTISEMENT  The facility and at least 10 others in North America have temporarily closed or reduced production in about the last two weeks because of the pandemic, disrupting food supply chains that have struggled to keep pace with surging demand at grocery stores.  According to more than a dozen interviews with U.S and Canadian plant workers, union leaders and industry analysts, a lack of protective equipment and the nature of “elbow to elbow” work required to debone chickens, chop beef and slice hams are highlighting risks for employees and limiting output as some forego the low-paying work.  Companies that added protections, such as enhanced cleaning or spacing out workers, say the moves are further slowing meat production.  Smithfield Foods, the world’s biggest pork processor said April 12 it is indefinitely shutting a pork plant that accounts for about four to five percent of U.S. production. It warned that plant shutdowns are pushing the United States “perilously close to the edge” in meat supplies for grocers.   ADVERTISEMENT  Lockdowns that aim to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus have prevented farmers across the globe from delivering food products to consumers. Millions of labourers also cannot get to the fields for harvesting and planting, and there are too few truckers to keep goods moving.  The United States and Canada are among the world’s biggest shippers of beef and pork. Food production has continued as governments try to ensure adequate supplies, even as they close broad swathes of the economy.  The closures and increased absenteeism among workers have contributed to drops in the price of livestock as farmers find fewer places for slaughter. Since March 25, nearby lean hog futures have plunged 35 percent, and live cattle prices shed 15 percent, straining the U.S. farm economy.  North American meat demand has dropped 30 percent in the past month as declining sales of restaurant meat such as steaks and chicken wings outweighed a spike in retail demand for ground beef, said Christine McCracken, Rabobank’s animal protein analyst.  Frozen meat in U.S. cold storage facilities remains plentiful, but supply could be whittled down as exports to protein-hungry China increase after a trade agreement removed obstacles for American meat purchases.   ADVERTISEMENT  “There’s a huge risk of additional plant closures,” McCracken said.  The latest came April 13 when JBS said it will shutter its Greeley, Colorado, beef plant, which accounts for about five percent of the country’s production, until April 24.  JBS previously had to reduce production at the facility because about 800 to 1,000 workers a day have stayed home since the end of March, said Kim Cordova, president of the local United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union that represents employees.  The union knew of at least 50 cases and two deaths among employees as of April 10.  Plant worker Saul Sanchez, known affectionately as “Grandpa” among some co-workers, tested positive for the virus and died on April 7 at 78 years old, according to his daughter, Beatriz Rangel. She said he only went from home to work before developing symptoms, including a low fever.  “I’m heartbroken because my dad was so loyal,” Rangel said.  JBS confirmed an employee with three decades of experience died from complications associated with COVID-19, without naming Sanchez. He was never symptomatic while at work and never worked in the facility while sick, according to the company.  JBS said it was working with federal and state governments to obtain tests for all plant employees.  Weld County, where the plant is located, had the fourth highest number of COVID-19 cases of any county in Colorado on April 10, according to the state. Health officials confirmed cases among JBS workers.  JBS said high absenteeism at the plant led the process of cutting carcasses into pieces of beef to fall behind slaughter rates. The company disputed the union’s numbers on worker absences but did not provide its own. It took steps, including buying masks and putting up plexiglass shields in lunch rooms to protect employees, said Cameron Bruett, spokesman for JBS USA.  At Wayne Farms’ chicken plant in Decatur, Alabama, some workers are upset the company recently made employees pay for masks, said Mona Darby, who inspects chicken breasts there and is a local leader of hundreds of poultry workers for the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.  “My life is in jeopardy because we’re working elbow to elbow,” she said.  Wayne Farms, with annual sales exceeding $2 billion, is trying to obtain masks to distribute to employees, though supplies are limited, spokesperson Frank Singleton said. He did not know of any instances where employees were charged for masks, he added.  Workers at a Tyson Foods’ chicken plant in Shelbyville, Tennessee, bought their own masks when the facility ran out, said Kim Hickerson, who loads chicken on trucks there and is a union leader. Some are talking about quitting because they are scared of getting sick, he said.  “I just put it in God’s hands,” he said.  Tyson, the top U.S. meat producer, is working to find more personal protective equipment for employees, spokesperson Worth Sparkman said. The company increased cleaning at facilities and sought to space out employees, which can both slow production, according to a statement.  Workers have lost their trust in Olymel after an outbreak of the COVID-19 virus closed a plant in Yamachiche, Que., according to union spokesperson Anouk Collet.  “They do not feel that the company took all the measures they could have taken to keep them safe,” she said.  Company spokesperson Richard Vigneault said the plant will reopen April 14 with new measures in place, such as separating panels, masks and visors.  Marc Perrone, international president of the UFCW union, said meat plant workers are increasingly weighing concerns about their own safety and their responsibility to produce food.  “If we don’t take care of the food supply, the American people are going to panic,” he said.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss the matter before an official announcement.  Modly's designated replacement will be James McPherson, a Navy veteran who is currently serving undersecretary of the Army. He was confirmed in that position by the Senate last month. Prior to that he was the Army's general counsel.  Modly had created a combustible controversy by firing the Roosevelt's skipper, Capt. Brett E. Crozier, last week, saying Crozier had shown 'extremely poor judgment' in widely distributing by email a letter calling for urgent help with the COVID-19 outbreak aboard his ship.  Modly then flew to the ship, at port in Guam, and delivered a speech to the crew Sunday in which he lambasted Crozier, saying he was either 'too naive or too stupid' to be in charge of an aircraft carrier.  On Monday night, at Esper's insistence, Modly issued a public apology, but by then the calls among Democrats in Congress for his resignation were mounting. On Tuesday morning, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Modly must go.  'Sadly, Acting Secretary Modly's actions and words demonstrate his failure to prioritize the force protection of our troops,\" Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a written statement. 'He showed a serious lack of the sound judgment and strong leadership needed during this time. Acting Secretary Modly must be removed from his position or resign.'  Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Modly had fired Crozier against the advice of Navy military leaders.  \"The new leadership of the Navy must do better in leading and protecting sailors, Marines and their families in this unprecedented crisis,' Reed said.  As of Tuesday, the Navy said 79% of the Roosevelt crew had been tested for the coronavirus, and 230 of them were positive. About 2,000 of the 4,865 crew members had been taken off the ship.  The episode, which began when the Roosevelt reported its first COVID-19 case among the crew on March 22, two weeks after making a port visit in Vietnam, is one of the more extraordinary dramas in recent U.S. military history. In addition to the health threat posed to the crew of more than 4,800 sailors, the outbreak has sidelined the warship indefinitely and created conflict at the highest levels of the Pentagon.  Esper had publicly expressed his support for Modly's decision to fire Crozier, but after Modly's speech about the ship, Esper grew unsettled. Just hours after Modly issued a statement Monday defending his words, Esper compelled Modly to reverse course and issue a public apology.  \"I want to apologize for any confusion this choice of words may have caused,' he wrote, referring to his speech aboard the Roosevelt. 'I also want to apologize directly to Captain Crozier, his family, and the entire crew of the Theodore Roosevelt for any pain my remarks may have caused.'  Esper's staff had told Modly he must apologize, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private conversation.  Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday that he might get involved, agreeing that Modly's criticism of Crozier was 'a rough statement.' He said Crozier made a mistake when he sent a memo to several people laying out his concerns about the crew and the virus. In the memo, which was leaked to the media, Crozier said: 'We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die.'  Trump said Crozier had a good career prior to this incident, adding, 'I don't want to destroy somebody for having a bad day.'  Modly, in his apology, reframed his earlier remarks that Crozier was \"too naive or too stupid' to command. Instead, he said he believes Crozier is 'smart and passionate.'  'I believe, precisely because he is not naive and stupid, that he sent his alarming email with the intention of getting it into the public domain in an effort to draw public attention to the situation on his ship,' Modly wrote.  Aboard the ship, Modly had urged the crew to stop complaining.  'It is the mission of the ship that matters,' he said. 'You all know this, but in my view your Captain lost sight of this and he compromised critical information about your status intentionally to draw greater attention to your situation.'  Modly, a 1983 Naval Academy graduate, became the acting Navy secretary last November after Richard Spencer was ousted from the position. Trump last month nominated retired Rear Adm. Kenneth Braithwaite, the current ambassador to Norway, to be the next Navy secretary.  In his remarks aboard the Roosevelt, Modly raised issues likely to please Trump. He accused the news media, for example, of manipulating a political agenda to divide the country and embarrass the Navy. He said China 'was not forthcoming' about the coronavirus when it began spreading there months ago, echoing Trump's oft-repeated statement that China could have done more to prevent a pandemic.  And Modly invoked the name of Trump's chief Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, noting that the former vice president had said Modly's decision to fire Crozier was almost criminal. 'I assure you it was not,' Modly said.

As coronavirus infections nearly overwhelm New York City’s medical capabilities, the president on Saturday attended the launch of USNS Comfort, one of the Navy’s two hospital ships, which is headed to New York City. At 1,000 beds, the vessel also has several operating rooms, a pharmacy, and fully functional laboratory, staffed by more than 600 skilled military medical personnel.  “Our country is at war with an invisible enemy,” the president said, referring to COVID-19. “We are marshaling the full power of the American nation … to vanquish the virus, and we will do that.”  Trump and Esper watch the USNS Comfort leave the pier pic.twitter.com/5YmqZFnREc — Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) March 28, 2020  Meanwhile, the president has authorized the Pentagon via executive order to call up 1 million reserve and retired medical military personnel to be deployed to the hardest-hit regions of the country as more than 110,000 Americans (as of this writing) and counting are infected with the disease.  He may yet have to take more drastic action, however.  As reported by The Wall Street Journal on Saturday, Trump is seriously considering placing a quarantine on New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, all hard-hit by virus, to prevent its spread:  The president didn’t specify what a quarantine would entail, but said it could include restrictions on travel from New York and New Jersey. New York City alone has more than 23,000 cases, nearly a quarter of all the cases in the country.  The largest number of cases continues to be in the state of New York, where 52,318 people are infected and 728 had died from the virus as of Saturday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said during a morning briefing.  ‘I don’t even know what that means’  “We might not have to do it, but there’s a possibility that sometime today we’ll do a quarantine,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One enroute to seeing off the USNS Comfort as it began its journey north.  As for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, he told reporters he hadn’t had any discussions with the president about a quarantine.  “I haven’t had those conversations. I don’t even know what that means,” Cuomo said at a Saturday press briefing. “I don’t know how that could be legally enforceable, and from a medical point of view I don’t know what you would be accomplishing.” (Related: Dear clueless America: You are now living under the tyranny you deserve, for you said nothing when the Big Tech censors came for the truth-tellers who warned you this would happen.)  As for why the quarantine might be necessary, Trump referenced an executive action taken by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who, on Monday, ordered travelers from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to self-isolate for 14 days, the infection cycle for the virus. And also earlier last week, Trump administration officials issued the same recommendation to anyone leaving New York.  “Some people would like to see New York quarantined because it’s a hotspot — New York, New Jersey, maybe one or two other places, certain parts of Connecticut quarantined,” the president told reporters outside the White House earlier in the day, according to Fox News.  “I’m thinking about that right now. We might not have to do it but there’s a possibility that sometime today we’ll do a quarantine — short term, two weeks for New York, probably New Jersey and certain parts of Connecticut,” he added.  I am giving consideration to a QUARANTINE of developing “hot spots”, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. A decision will be made, one way or another, shortly. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2020  Trump explained that if he did put a quarantine in place, it would most likely consist of restrictions on residents of those states traveling to other parts of the country. It would not affect truckers or trade, however.  “This will be an enforceable quarantine, but hopefully we won’t need it,” the president added.

Promoter Rosendo Álvarez, a former two-time world champion, had dismissed the threat of the virus,  “Here we don’t fear the coronavirus, and there is no quarantine. The three deaths (reported so far by the Ministry of Health) came from outside and nobody within the country has been contaminated,” Álvarez, known as “El Búfalo,” said before the event.  But his offer of free tickets appeared to fill only about a tenth of the 8,000 seats in the Alexis Argoello gym. Officials did not announce attendance figures.  The fights were broadcast by Nicaragua's state-owned Canal 6 and ESPN Latin America through its ESPN KnockOut program.  Alvarez said he signed up the 16 local boxers for the card because they needed to work.  “Nicaragua is a poor country and the boxers have to eat. They can’t stay shut up in their house,\" he said.  The government insists Nicaragua has been barely touched by COVID-19. The Ministry of Health reports only 11 positive cases and the three deaths. Meanwhile, in neighboring or nearby countries the regional Central American Integration System has reported roughly 13,000 cases and about 500 deaths.  The Nicaraguan baseball and soccer leagues are still playing, and Saturday's local sports pages included stories on a triathlon and school wrestling tournaments. President Daniel Ortega recently ordered 1.8 million students back to school and 170,000 state employees back to work following a 15-day vacation.  This month alone, the government Tourism Institute promoted at least 81 mass events, including carnivals and parades. The government's approach has prompted expressions of concern from the Pan American Health Organization and alarmed local experts.  “Popular celebrations, massive funerals, marches and similar activities increase the risk of multiple simultaneous outbreaks in the whole country,” warned epidemiologist Álvaro Ramírez. “I still don't understand what the government is betting on.\"  Álvarez said his organization was taking protective measures at the bouts. Spectators were told to stay at least 2 meters (6 1/2 feet) from the ring, and medics checked temperatures when they entered. Face masks were required.  Boxers also had to have “a rigorous medical checkup,” he said. But he said there were no tests for the coronavirus, because “none of them have symptoms nor have they gotten sick in training.”   share story  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 10, "joy": 2, "negative": 3, "disgust": 1, "positive": 6, "anger": 3, "fear": 3, "trust": 5}, "metadata": ["facebook", "twitter", "sports", "coronavirus", "dismissed", "deaths", "ministry", "america", "students", "tourism", "institute", "government's", "epidemiologist", "protective", "masks", "symptoms"]}, {"text": "The government is likely to unveil an economic stimulus package as the country battles to curb the spread of coronavirus, a source from Finance Ministry told ANI on Wednesday.

Since 2010, companies trading on the S&P 500 stock index spent over $5.3 trillion on stock buybacks. Allowing companies to borrow money so they can buy back stock and issue dividends is wrong. It destroys future growth and earnings, and it impairs a company’s ability to self-finance in a crisis while artificially pushing stock prices higher. Share buybacks involve a conflict of interest because top executives owe a fiduciary duty to their companies and simultaneously profit from exercising stock options. If the borrowed money was used to stimulate organic growth or maintain capital buffers to protect companies from economic recessions, executive pay would be less excessive and bailouts would not be needed.  Multi-billionaire Richard Branson owns the majority of shares in Virgin Atlantic airlines, an airline which will likely seek a £7.5 billion government bailout. Had Branson deployed capital to strengthen Virgin Atlantic’s balance sheet rather than using leverage to purchase Flybe, which has since gone bankrupt, perhaps a bailout of Virgin Atlantic would not be necessary. Why shouldn’t Branson use the excessive compensation he took from his company to bail out his company?  EasyJet’s Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou and his relatives own over thirty percent of EasyJet’s shares and have received more than $300 million in dividend payments while failing to adequately capitalize their company with “buffers” in the case of an economic recession. Now Sir Stelios comes begging for taxpayer bailouts? Really?  The UK needs to wake up. Remember Gordon Brown, the PM who claimed he ended “Boom and Bust.” From 1999-2002, Brown bailed out the Bullion Banks by selling all of the UK’s gold for an average of around US$275 an ounce. At today’s prices that gold would be worth over $10 billion more than the price Brown sold it for. In 2008, Alistair Darling and Vince Cable bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Bank and the Royal Mail. Remember how RBS boss Fred “The Shred” Godwin destroyed RBS and walked away with over £20 million in compensation? Goodwin’s pension is worth £17 million, yet UK taxpayers remain on the hook for those bank shares twelve years later.  In the USA, the government is about to launch ANOTHER bailout program worth at least US$6 trillion. Warren Buffett, one of America’s richest men, is a majority shareholder in several of the US airline companies seeking bailouts — nearly all of whom used excessive leverage to repurchase shares and paid shareholders like Buffett hefty dividends and funded the incentive-based CEO bonus pools. Why should taxpayers be on the hook when leverage goes wrong because CEOs suck the lifeblood out of their companies?  After handing out trillions in bailouts and guarantees in 2008, a furious public demanded answers. Politicians in the UK and US governments held public inquires and promised that irresponsible corporate leaders would be held accountable and that similar bailouts would never happen again. The 2020 $6 trillion bailout package tells us these promises were lies.  So, what created this mess? The financial system has too much debt, too much credit and too much leverage. Oligarchs now hold taxpayers hostage and demand trillions in bailouts that no country can afford.  This is not capitalism. Capitalism is simple. You let winners win. You let losers lose. Regulate the whole show to the minimum degree realistically necessary to protect workers, consumers and citizens. These simple rules have been forgotten. Instead, we have an adulterated form of capitalism that, as far as finance is concerned, has no losers.  You’ve bought some stupid assets or made some stupid investments? Don’t worry, central banks will bail you out. The economy is looking weak? Don’t worry, central banks will roll those printing presses. Your bank, airline or shale oil company is over-leveraged, badly run and insolvent? Don’t worry, your friend the President, Prime Minister, Central Banker, Exchequer or Treasury Secretary is bound to have a solution.  Capitalism without bankruptcy is like Catholicism without God. Right now, we do not need bailouts — fewer bankruptcies will occur in the future if we require bonus claw-backs and make share buybacks illegal. It’s time to let capitalism be capitalism.  0 0 vote Article Rating  Help us grow. Support The Duran on Patreon!

New York nursing homes have become a painful place Amid the Corona virus outbreak. A tragic end toa life were at some facilities. There is no dying with dignity. Bodies are being placed in rooms where their patients in the rooms alongside the body, severe understaffing and a lack of testing has led to atleast 2500 patients dying out of 96,000 residents, according to the state company. People get tested in the nursing home. If you have advanced testing, then you'll have a better idea what percent of your population has actually been exposed.

When it comes to staffing, they deserve to know that their families are being kept safe and they're practicing social distance. They're being tested these air lives that every second count.  Advertisement 'Heartbreaking' report shows virus ravaging New York nursing homes Share Shares Copy Link Copy  The despair wrought on nursing homes by the coronavirus was laid bare Friday in a state survey identifying numerous New York facilities where multiple patients died over the past few weeks.Nineteen of the state's nursing homes reported 20 or more deaths linked to the pandemic, the survey said.One Brooklyn home, the Cobble Hill Health Center, was listed as having 55 deaths. Officials at the facility, which has more than 300 beds located in a 19th-century former hospital in a tony section of Brooklyn, didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.Four more homes, in the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island, were listed as having at least 40 deaths.“These have been surreal times, and we are suffering, as is everybody else,” said Dr. Roy Goldberg, medical director at Kings Harbor Multicare Center, a 720-bed home in the Bronx which reported 45 fatalities.“Every death is heartbreaking,” he said.The survey's release came after days of news media reports about homes so stricken by the virus that bodies had to be stacked inside storage rooms while families struggled to get information about isolated loved ones.The list was far from complete. It was based on a survey sent by the state asking for details. Nursing homes had until 2 p.m. Thursday to respond.“We only know what they tell us,\" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.Connecticut released a similar list Thursday, reporting that eight nursing homes had at least 10 residents die.Through Tuesday, at least 2,477 nursing home patients have been killed by the virus in New York, according to state figures. That amounts to about one in five of the state’s virus-related fatalities. In Connecticut, nursing home residents account for 375 of the state's 971 virus deaths. Until this week, officials in several states had declined to identify nursing homes with deadly outbreaks, saying patients deserved privacy or citing challenges in determining whether some extremely frail patients had died of the virus, or other causes.Many nursing home administrators also declined to release information, leading Cuomo to say this week that the state would begin requiring homes to inform patients and their families within 24 hours if a resident got the virus or died.Stephen Hanse, president and CEO of the New York State Health Facilities Association and the New York State Center for Assisted Living, said the figures reflect the fact that those facilities are dealing with extremely vulnerable patients.“Outbreaks are not the result of inattentiveness or a shortcoming in our facilities,\" he wrote in a statement. “The very nature of long-term care is a high touch environment where social distancing is not an option. Staff are helping residents with bathing, dressing, eating and other personal daily needs.”He also blamed the state health department for worsening the situation by barring nursing homes from denying admission to patients with COVID-19 if they were medically stable.Nursing homes have been known since the earliest days of the outbreak as a likely trouble spot. A home in Washington state lost 43 residents early in the virus’s spread into the country.Yet even with that early warning, many nursing homes remained without adequate supplies of personal protective equipment. Testing for residents and staff remains spotty, at best.Federal officials in mid-March banned visitors, halted group activities and ordered mandatory screening of workers for respiratory symptoms, but by then the virus had quietly spread widely.Kings Harbor's medical director, Goldberg, said staff members there created two dedicated COVID-19 units to treat infected patients and followed “every department of health and CDC recommendation and regulation.”“Obtaining PPE has always been a struggle,” he added, “but we’ve always stayed one step ahead.”New York state's health commissioner, Howard Zucker, said the state is providing enough personal protective equipment for nursing homes and helping with staffing.“We’re working with each individual nursing home to address that. We contact them and if there’s a need for PPE ... we have stockpiles.\"An Associated Press tally from media reports and state health departments indicates at least 6,461 deaths have been linked to coronavirus in nursing homes and long-term care facilities nationwide as of Friday.Chris Laxton, executive director of the The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, applauded the state for releasing the data. But he believes the spread of COVID-19 and related deaths are still being under-reported.“Growth in both cases and deaths is to be expected, even as the surge begins to level off in the community and in hospitals,” Laxton said. “We continue to be in urgent need of PPE, especially gowns, test kits, and surge staff, to limit staff from traveling between buildings and risking additional spread.”Some nursing homes have disclosed information voluntarily that differed from the numbers put out by the state Friday.The state survey listed 10 deaths at the Montgomery Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, about 50 miles north of New York City, but facility Vice President Vincent Maniscalco said 21 residents have died recently. Eight of those patients, he said, had symptoms consistent with the virus but died prior to being tested.“It’s been a very trying time for the staff, to lose residents they care for day in and day out,” Maniscalco said.With visitors barred from nursing homes to try to keep the infection out, many of those patients have died with only the home's workers to comfort them.“When somebody passes away, they celebrate a resident’s life,” Maniscalco said.Outbreaks killed 46 at a nursing home in suburban Richmond, Virginia, and 22 at a home in central Indiana. County officials in northern New Jersey said Thursday that at least 26 patients had died at a nursing home in Andover.An Associated Press report found infections were continuing to find their way into nursing homes because screening staff for a fever or questioning them about symptoms didn’t catch people who were infected but asymptomatic.

RELATED: How to spot the difference between the flu and coronavirus  Public health officials say it will take a year to 18 months to fully validate any potential vaccine.  Testing will begin with 45 young, healthy volunteers with different doses of shots co-developed by NIH and Moderna Inc. There’s no chance participants could get infected from the shots, because they don’t contain the virus itself. The goal is purely to check that the vaccines show no worrisome side effects, setting the stage for larger tests.  Dozens of research groups around the world are racing to create a vaccine as COVID-19 cases continue to grow. Importantly, they’re pursuing different types of vaccines — shots developed from new technologies that not only are faster to produce than traditional inoculations but might prove more potent. Some researchers even aim for temporary vaccines, such as shots that might guard people’s health a month or two at a time while longer-lasting protection is developed.   Advertisement  For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The worldwide outbreak has sickened more than 156,000 people and left more than 5,800 dead. The death toll in the United States is more than 50, while infections neared 3,000 across 49 states and the District of Columbia.

One man in the group, 42-year-old Shah Tawoos, points at a dirty stream of water which is making its way beneath the rotten tent – his “home” for more than a decade.  “Look at the humidity inside and the mud outside the tent, even dogs can’t and won’t bear this, but we have nowhere to go,” Tawoos told Arab News.  The tent is one of many located in the Charahi Qambar (CQ) camp, on the western fringes of Kabul, where thousands of internally displaced persons (IDPs) like Tawoos are denied their rights and are continuously threatened with deportation.  “Ministers and other authorities came and went, pledging to help us with houses, but nothing has happened. We do not know where the government spends the national budget and foreign aid,” he said.  According to the Internal Monitoring Displacement Centre (IMDC), the CQ is one of 47 camps that house nearly 3 million IDPs, who had their lives upended either by natural disasters or a fresh bout of violence since the Taliban’s ouster in the US-led invasion in 2001.  The displacements were triggered by fighting and attacks involving the Taliban, government and US-led forces, Daesh and other nonstate armed groups.  “In the first half of 2020, there were 117,000 new displacements associated with conflict and violence and 30,000 as a result of disasters,” according to the IMDC.  The CQ camp is filled with refugees from Afghanistan’s south where, according to the United Nations, more than 5,000 families have fled the fighting between the Taliban insurgents and Afghan government forces, specifically in the Helmand province.  The conditions at these camps are deplorable, with IDPs residing in tents either donated by local or foreign relief agencies or in small mud houses built using their resources.  The tents are rotting. Their condition, residents say, gets worse in summer when heavy rain and snow weakens the fabric, resulting in gaping holes.  “Our tents become infested with mosquitoes in the summer heat and unbearably cold in winter times,” Rahmat Gul, another resident of the camp, said.  He laments about the lack of electricity and water supply and highlights the plight of thousands of children who have no access to education or, often, food.  There are other issues as well, Gul says, such as unemployment and poverty, forcing some men and women to beg to make ends meet.  The camp first attracted attention in 2012 after at least 15 IDP children froze to death due to the harsh winter conditions.  The displacements were the topic of discussion once again during a virtual donor conference in Geneva on Monday and Tuesday where ministers from nearly 70 countries and officials of humanitarian organisations spoke about funding cuts and tighter restrictions on vital aid for Afghanistan, marking further challenges for a nation that is preparing for an early withdrawal of US-led foreign troops and grappling with the COVID-19 crisis.  “We want the participants (in Geneva) to act with caution, take firm measures for accountability and transparency from our government. Otherwise we fear that just like in the past, much of the aid will be squandered either by foreign contractors or officials in our government,” Gul said.  Ahead of the conference which began on Monday, President Ashraf Ghani said he hoped for it to generate billions of dollars of aid.  “The outcome of this pledging conference will heavily influence the country’s future development and our path towards self-reliance and peace,” Ghani said during the weekend in Kabul.  It follows a similar event in Belgium in 2016 where donors pledged to extend $15 billion in aid to Afghanistan for the next five years.  However, finance ministry spokesman Shamrooz Khan Masjidi was unable to comment on how much of the pledged aid had been disbursed.  “We would like a major part of the aid to be channeled through government budgets,” he said.  He added that the focus of all future aid would be on building infrastructure, repatriation of refugees and aiding the war displaced.  “Kabul had fulfilled the benchmarks set by donors for the last conference with regards to combating corruption and was open for accountability for the cash it has spent,” he said.  The Geneva meeting comes amid a deadlock in the talks between the Afghan government and Taliban negotiators in Doha, Qatar, that have been going on since Sept. 12, as well as rising discontent with Ghani’s government at home and abroad due to soaring corruption, weak governance and the alleged squandering of state resources.  A recent report released by US watchdog SIGAR said: “The Afghan government makes paper reforms, such as drafting regulations or holding meetings, rather than concrete actions that would reduce corruption, such as arresting powerful actors.”  Following the SIGAR report and ahead of the Geneva conference, Ghani’s government ordered the formation of another commission to fight graft.  However, Sayed Ikram Afzali, executive director of Integrity Watch, said that the government had “no will for fighting corruption and resorts to symbolic works for drawing the attention at international conferences.”  A survey conducted by the Afghan Civil Society Forum on Sunday said that 90 percent of participants believed that “the government is corrupt.”  Afghanistan’s last permanent ambassador to the United Nations, Mahmoud Saikal, said on Monday: “In this time of high corruption, it is extremely important donors demand strong accountability from those who claim to represent our people.”  It’s a thought echoed by UN Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi. He also warned of “grave consequences” if the world turned away from Afghanistan.  “Failure on either account would see Afghanistan slide backwards with disastrous consequences, including further displacement, possibly on a larger scale…” he said in a statement on Sunday.

A police investigation was launched over the weekend after regional health authorities were able to access patient files at the Residence Herron and found that 31 of the residence’s 150 or so seniors had died since March 13. Quebec’s health department is also investigating.  Legault said at least five of the deaths were due to COVID-19, but that number could rise.  “Quite honestly, I think … there was gross negligence at Residence Herron,” Legault said on Saturday.  The authorities first inspected Residence Herron on March 29, three days after word of the first death. They found the residence “deserted” as staff had walked off the job.  Lynne McVey, head of the health board, has said her team began assisting the short-staffed workers to feed, wash and change patients, but only learned the full scope of the problem after getting a legal order allowing them to view families’ contact information and patient medical files.  Katasa Groupe, which owns the residence and several others, has not answered requests for comment, and the home is now under government trusteeship.  The Residence Herron story is only the latest report into troubling conditions at seniors’ and long-term care homes, which have been linked to a large percentage of the country’s COVID-19 deaths.  That includes another residence in Laval, north of Montreal, where 21 people have died and 115 have tested positive for COVID-19.  The coroner’s office said in its statement that it is not currently investigating other homes, but is watching the situation and could intervene if needed.  In a statement on Sunday, the provincial health department confirmed it would proceed to inspect all the province’s 40 private long-term care centres in the coming days.  “Every effort is being made to protect seniors and avoid tragic situations such as the one observed in the Herron private residential and long-term care centre that is not covered by an agreement,” the statement said.  Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, on Sunday lamented the deaths that COVID-19 has caused in long-term care facilities across the country, which she described in a statement as a “tragic legacy of this pandemic.”  “These heart-breaking events underscored the need for stringent infection prevention and control measures and led to the development of infection prevention and control guidance for long-term care homes,” she added.  That guidance includes strict rules around who can enter such facilities and detailed instructions on how to minimize the chances of an outbreak through proper hygiene and screening.  The Quebec ombudsman launched an investigation into the Residence Herron in 2017 after it received complaints including inadequate nursing care, a poor approach towards patients with cognitive difficulties, complaints over food and a lack communication with families.  The investigation found that the facility was providing adequate care, but the ombudsman cautioned in its report that management needed to ensure there was enough suitably-trained staff, given its intention to increase its number of patients.  In 2019, an inspection by Health and Social Services did not note any particular problems with clinical practices, but issued recommendations including the development of a policy to combat mistreatment, as well as improved communications with residents and their families, particularly in the areas of residents’ rights, end-of-life decisions and palliative care.

NEW YORK — New York covid-19-related deaths jumped yet again by more than 700 in a day, while hospitals battling the outbreak reported encouraging news. On the economic front, New York tried to improve its overwhelmed unemployment insurance website.  Here are developments in the coronavirus outbreak.   THE NUMBERS  Coronavirus deaths in New York jumped by 777 in one day, as the number of people hospitalized stayed relatively flat.  The mix of encouraging and grim news from Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Friday has become familiar this week as people hospitalized in previous weeks die. More than 3,000 deaths have been recorded since Monday to bring the statewide count to 7,844.  The number of hospitalizations increased by 290, compared to daily increases of more than 1,000 last week. The number of intensive care patients was actually down slightly for the first time since mid-March.  There were 18,569 people hospitalized.  Cuomo said that if the hospitalization rate stays flat, New York might not need the overflow field hospitals they have been scrambling to construct recently.  New York state has about 160,000 confirmed cases, a number that only counts infected people who have been tested.   ———   UNEMPLOYMENT WOES  New York state is getting help from Google to overhaul a decades-old unemployment benefits system that has left laid-off workers frustrated and awaiting help.  Google helped New York design a revamped website that launched Thursday evening. The state also added 300 workers to its 700-person staff to process unemployment benefit applications.  Gov. Cuomo said the state Department of Labor’s system has crashed because of a record-shattering surge in claims amid outbreak-related layoffs.  There have been 350,000 claims in the last week. So far, 600,000 claims over the past three weeks have been successfully processed and more than 200,000 are still in partial status, according to the Cuomo administration.  “Government shuts down the private sector economy. You have millions out of work,” Cuomo said Thursday. “The next shoe to drop is going to be millions of people call in for unemployment benefits, crashing the system that handles the unemployment benefits because you’ve had a hundredfold increase, which is what has happened.”  The state is also trying to reduce call volume by having state workers call up individuals to follow-up with incomplete applications. Previously, applicants who left fields blank were told to call the state’s unemployment system.

The market got back not quite half of what it lost in a breathtaking drop a day earlier, which was the biggest in more than three decades. The S&P 500 rose 6% and the Dow rose 5.2%, or 1,049 points. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the government intends to send to checks to Americans in the next two weeks. Earlier, the Federal Reserve dusted off a program from the 2008 financial crisis to get the short-term borrowing market working more smoothly.  THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story is below:  Stocks jumped Tuesday as President Donald Trump promised he’s “going big” with plans to blunt the economic pain caused by the coronavirus outbreak.  Markets around the world remain highly volatile as traders see a recession growing more likely if it hasn’t begun already. Tuesday’s 4.9% gain for the S&P 500 meant it clawed back a little more than a third of its loss from a day before, its biggest in more than three decades. Experts say the big swings will likely continue until the number of new infections peaks.  Trump wants the government to send checks to Americans in the next two weeks to help support them while chunks of the economy come closer to shutting down, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday.  Gains for stocks accelerated as Trump and Mnuchin spoke at a briefing, but neither gave details about how big the stimulus could be. The administration is expected to propose a roughly $850 billion stimulus plan to help the economy, including relief for small businesses and the airline industry. The travel industry has been among the industries hardest hit by the outbreak. Planes sit grounded and hotels and casinos shut their doors.  Investors have been waiting for Washington to offer more aid for the economy. After flipping between gains and losses Tuesday morning, stocks turned decisively higher after the Federal Reserve revived a program first used in the 2008 financial crisis to help companies get access to cash for very short-term needs. It’s the latest in a string of big, emergency moves by the Fed and other central banks around the world to support the economy and smooth operations in markets.  No one expects such moves to fix the health crisis, but investors hope they can help blunt the economic blow.  “Government tends to show up late to the party with a bazooka,” said Barry Bannister, head of institutional equity strategy at Stifel. “It’s a bit of an overreaction, but that’s to be understood as normal for policymakers.”  “There are still a lot of questions in the mind of the market as to what will be enough,” said Robert Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. “It’s a start, but there’s still a lot to be determined.”  Ultimately, investors say they need to see the number of infections slow before markets can find a bottom. Worldwide cases now exceed 190,000. In the San Francisco area, nearly 7 million people were all but confined to their homes in the nation’s most sweeping lockdown.  For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, and those with mild illness recover in about two weeks. But severe illness including pneumonia can occur, especially in the elderly and people with existing health problems, and recovery could take six weeks in such cases.  Uncertainty about when the outbreak will be contained and how much economic damage will be done to individuals and businesses has kept the markets on a roller coaster as steep losses give way to sharp gains and are wiped out again, sometimes all in the same day.  That’s made investors skeptical about market rallies.  “I don’t think we’re going to be able to trust movements in the market for some time,” said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager with Globalt Investments.  Trading was unsettled around the world. European stocks swung from gains to losses and back to gains. South Korean stocks fell to their fifth straight loss of 2.5%, but Japanese stocks shook off an early loss to edge higher.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average see-sawed through the day. It went from up 600 points to down 300 to up 1,190 and then pulled back again. It was up 668 points, or 3.3%, in afternoon trading. A day earlier, it lost nearly 3,000 after Trump said a recession may be on the way.  The S&P 500, which dictates the movements of workers’ 401(k) accounts much more than the Dow, is still roughly 26% below its record set last month and is close to where it was in late 2018, erasing most of the best year for stocks in decades.  Stocks have had a few rebounds since the market began selling off in mid-February on worries that COVID-19 will slam the economy and corporate profits. But all have ended up short-lived. The S&P 500 has had four days in the last few weeks where it surged more than 4%, a remarkably large amount in normal times, and has slumped more than 2.8% the following day each time.  The virus has spread so quickly that its effects haven’t shown up in much U.S. economic data yet. A report on Monday about manufacturing in New York State was the first piece of evidence that manufacturing is contracting due to the outbreak. On Tuesday, a report showed that retail sales weakened in February, when economists had been expecting a gain.  “The global recession is here and now,” S&P Global economists wrote in a report Tuesday.  They say initial data from China suggests its economy was hit harder than expected, though it has begun to stabilize. “Europe and the U.S. are following a similar path,” the economists wrote.

Over the weekend, the number of confirmed cases in the United States rose to 88. People have tested positive for coronavirus in the following states: Washington, California, Illinois, Rhode Island, New York, Florida, Texas, and Oregon. Two people in Washington have died and it is believed that the virus may have been spreading through the state undetected for six weeks now. The case in Texas is an evacuee who was “mistakenly” released from a quarantine facility by the CDC. The case in New York is a woman who resides in Manhattan who had recently visited Iran.  Diamond Princess evacuees who have tested negative are due to be released from quarantine today, but some cases with incubation that lasted as long as 27 days have many wondering if the 14-day quarantine is long enough.  The virus has prompted some school closures in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Rhode Island. Thousands of Americans are self-quarantined. California, Washington, and Oregon have reported “community spread,” which means that investigators are unable to figure out where patients have contracted the virus. Community spread is generally a turning point in an outbreak that means the illness is uncontained.  An explosion in purchases of essential items like food and toilet paper took place all over the country this weekend as people began to become more aware of the need to be prepared to stay home for a period of time. (If you need more information about getting prepared for quarantines, read this article and get this book.)  A series of errors by the CDC is part of the failure  The CDC failed to follow guidelines laid out by the World Health Organization and developed its own test. Unfortunately, that test was faulty, putting the nation weeks behind in detected cases.  As a result, until Wednesday the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration only allowed those state labs to use the test — a decision with potentially significant consequences. The lack of a reliable test prevented local officials from taking a crucial first step in coping with a possible outbreak — “surveillance testing” of hundreds of people in possible hotspots. Epidemiologists in other countries have used this sort of testing to track the spread of the disease before large numbers of people turn up at hospitals. (source)  According to ProPublica, the CDC promised on February 14 to begin surveillance testing in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle, but this testing has not yet begun. As I wrote last week, I don’t believe the official numbers are reflective of the actual cases because of narrow guidelines about who can be tested, the faulty tests, and the complete lack of tests in many areas.  Vice President Pence said over the weekend that 75,000 more testing kits will be made available this week. He also seems to be loosening the criteria to be tested, telling Jake Tapper in an interview, “…we’ve established a process in a number of cities across the country where if somebody presents at the local hospital with a respiratory ailment, we want them also tested for coronavirus.”  Don’t be surprised to see a sharp increase in cases once more tests become available. This won’t necessarily mean that the illness is spreading faster – it just means that people will be diagnosed instead of being told they have the flu and getting sent home to spread it further.   What happens next  Federal and local governments will try to mitigate the spread. Expect to see more quarantines, workplace and school closures, and cancellations of public gatherings.  As other countries hard hit by coronavirus cancel public activities and shutter schools, HHS Secretary Azar said such measures could be part of the containment toolkit here, if needed. Keeping kids home from school and running workplaces on a skeleton staff is part of what experts call “social distancing,” a way to keep people from passing disease to one another. As recently as 2009, a flu pandemic led to school closures in many U.S. communities. “It can be indicated under certain circumstances that it might make sense to close a school or schools, or take other measures like that,” said Azar. In the U.S. that would be a decision made at the local level. (source)  There will be a lot of personal economic ramifications to this.  First, it means that there could be a lot of people not getting paid. Here’s some information on how to prepare for the financial consequences of a potential quarantine or workplace closure. If you are quarantined and your workplace isn’t closed, you may have some protection under the law to be sure that you keep your job according to this article on Forbes. It will also mean childcare issues for those who still need to be at work but whose children are unable to attend school.  Shortages will become more obvious soon.  N-95 masks won’t be the only thing in short supply soon. As people clear the shelves in supermarkets and general merchandise stores across the country, some of that inventory may not be replaced quickly. Mainstream sources suggest we could see bare shelves in mid-April, but I suspect after the weekend’s buying frenzy, our just-in-time supply chain could begin to fray as early as this week.  Part of this is the fact that so much of our merchandise originates in China. (Here’s a list of things that could soon be in short supply.) The problem is two-fold. First, factories have been shuttered as millions of Chinese people in numerous cities have been quarantined for more than a month, so production has ground to a halt. Secondly, shipping has seriously declined – world ports are already seeing an impact.  So even those who have money could soon have difficulty finding the products they want.  If you haven’t stocked up, now is the time to do so. The supply chain is showing its first signs of wear and it could be months (at the least) before it bounces back.  The economy shows all the signs of a pending recession.  Investors are bracing themselves for a bad week in the market. The travel sector and shipping industryare due to lose billions if the current trends continue. Economists warn we could be looking at a full-blown recession.  Consumer spending, says the Washington Post, has propped up the US economy for a decade. With potential job losses and income interruptions, people will (wisely) pull back from non-essential spending.  “The odds of a recession are roughly a coin toss, and that’s exceptionally high,” said Edward Al-Hussainy, an analyst at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. “Conferences are getting canceled. Corporations are asking people to work from home. Schools are getting closed. That is a massive hit to demand.” (source)  This is a situation that the usual governmental policy repairs cannot mitigate.  Interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve — which appeared more likely Friday after a late-afternoon statement by its chairman, Jerome Powell — can lower borrowing costs and raise stock prices. But they can’t replace the goods made by factories closed to keep their workers from getting sick with Covid-19, the serious respiratory illness the virus causes. The government can try to pump more money into people’s pockets directly, such as with tax rebates, but money alone won’t put goods on empty store shelves. Beyond the natural limitations of policy to cushion the damage, there is the economic and political backdrop of the current moment: a Fed with little room to cut already-low interest rates, and a Congress divided along partisan lines while a president seeks re-election. If a potential coronavirus downturn were a fire, the recession-fighters would be like a fire brigade low on supplies, fighting among themselves, and probably lacking the right chemicals to quench the flames anyway. (source)  This would be different from previous recessions like the one a decade ago. Not only will it lead to more unemployment and lower pay, but we’d also be dealing with the afore-mentioned shortage of goods. This could drive the prices of available goods up, creating a perfect storm for Americans.  We could begin to see social unrest.  Social unrest is different from civil unrest – it’s the part that comes before a breakdown of the system. As people become more and more nervous, the rumor mills begin and people start to take actions based on bad information. An example of this occurred in Alabama over the past week.  Not long before local leaders decided, in the words of one of them, that federal health officials “didn’t know what they were doing” with their plan to quarantine novel coronavirus patients in town, a doctor here set out in a biohazard suit to stage a one-man protest along the highway with a sign. “The virus has arrived. Are you ready?” it asked. The town didn’t think it was. Residents already were unnerved by strange stories posted on Facebook and shared via text messages about helicopters secretly flying in sick patients, that the virus was grown in a Chinese lab, that someone — either the media or the government — was lying to them about what was really going on. What happened here over the past week illustrates how poor planning by federal health officials and a rumor mill fueled by social media, polarized politics and a lack of clear communication can undermine public confidence in the response to the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease named covid-19… …The panic and problems that burned through Anniston also provided a preview of what could unfold in other communities, as the spread of the virus is considered by health experts to be inevitable.(source)  This isn’t to say that all the concerns of Anniston, Alabama are crazy conspiracy theories – but it’s a glimpse at how quickly a community can lose faith in the official response and begin to panic.  Selco wrote a few weeks ago that the worst of the situation wasn’t the virus. It was the threat to the system.  Virus or illness on itself might not be a problem in its essence, but the impact that it brings to the system and people might be so huge through the media that it causes the system to stop working in the normal way. So you could find yourself in a collapse not necessarily because of a huge pandemic, but because of the reaction to it. Another case might be the simple unwillingness from the system to admit how bad the situation is in order to stop the panic when folks realized the truth. So, what might bring the system to collapse might be a real pandemic or a reaction to the pandemic(which might or might not be controllable) or simply the government’s poor or late response to the pandemic. (source)  It’s not Selco’s first rodeo with systemic collapse, and it looks like things could play out exactly as he predicted. And it could play out soon.   What should you do?   Selco’s advice?  No matter what, in the end, it always comes down to the basics. So when you not sure what to do and when you are not sure what is gonna happen just go back to the basics and think about how you can keep yourself and your family secure and safe, fed, as far as possible from trouble, healthy, warm…and for how long. Do not forget the emphasis on “how long.” Do not get mesmerized by a particular possible event too much or too long, because yes, in the end, it is about the basics. (source)  Here’s a list to help you cover your basics. Even if you never see a quarantine, these items will help see you through a period of systemic failure. If you’re on this website, reading this article, you probably have a lot of the items already.  The week ahead is likely to bring rapid developments. (Sign up here and we’ll do our best to keep you updated.) It’s important to keep a clear head, to be ready to separate facts from theories, and to choose reliable sources for your information. (Not your sister’s cousin’s boyfriend’s friend.) Stay away from situations that could escalate into violence or disorder.  You can’t control the government response, shortages, and the overall economy. You can’t control the system. While we may be in for a bumpy ride, the best way to keep it together during stressful times is to focus your energy on what you can personally control.

It’s been an eye-opening experience for the actress — and for her fans.  She’s cut herself and been burned, yes. She’s also discovered she doesn’t like some Indian flavours and that her longtime wife, talk show host Ellen Degeneres, isn’t a fan of curry and garbanzo beans.  “We’re learning a lot about each other in quarantine!” she admits on Instagram.  We are indeed learning a lot about each other these days, and that’s especially true with our celebrities. Social distancing has meant they have no army of publicists or glam squad. They’re bored and unfiltered — and often incredibly relatable.  Cardi B recently inexplicably ran headfirst into a massive Jenga tower and a daffy Madonna sang her hit “Vogue” into a hairbrush but changed the lyrics to include fried fish. Hillary Swank learned to crochet — and now has a new knit hat to prove it. Ariana Grande showed off her natural hair and Marlee Matlin put on her old wedding dress. “I’m losing my mind but what else is there to do?” she wrote.  Stuck inside, Justin Bieber reverted to a childhood objective. Clad in a onesie and a winter hat, the singer attempted a round of “ The Floor Is Lava ” in his massive living room, leaping onto cushions, chairs, foot stools, two skateboard and a roller. The video has been seen over 9 million times.  “I think now people need the human touch even more, and I think celebrities really understand that,” says Neal Schaffer, a social media strategy consultant whose new book is “ The Age of Influence.” “People want to relate to real things, real people.”  While some influencers and stars continue to post a flood of flattering, carefully stage-managed images with every hair in place, others are indeed mirroring us — unshaven, unwashed and not ashamed.  “When I drink, I get really, really brilliant ideas,” the singer Pink confessed recently. “And last night, I got an idea — I can cut hair.” She then reveals some choppy, shaved spots on her head.  Celebrities, it turns out, really are just like us: They get drunk and do stupid stuff, too. And they’re like us in another way, too: Pink later announced that she also had contracted the virus.  The coronavirus has also unlocked places we never expected to go, like Selena Gomez’s bathroom and inside Broadway star Adrienne Warren’s bathtub. We’ve gotten to inspect Rosie O’Donnell’s messy garage/art studio.  Theater icon Patti LuPone was taking part in a livestreamed benefit led by O’Donnell when theatre fans grew enchanted by something they’d never seen before: Lupone’s cool basement. They could see a colorful, light-up vintage jukebox and a wall rack stacked with cassette tapes.  So LuPone leaned into the interest, later making little video tours on Twitter that include her subterranean one-armed bandit, a massage table, mementos, her desk and a pinball machine. “I have so much to show you,” she says.  Yuval Ben-Itzhak, the CEO of Socialbakers, a social media marketing company, has noticed the trend and encourages it. He suspects fans will reward the more honest of celebrities at the other end of this crisis.  “By giving their audience a glimpse into their lives — from showing their homes, their families or themselves looking casual, like people typically do at home — celebrities are likely to actually increase their engagement,” Ben-Itzhak says. “Users seem to really engage with natural, authentic-looking content, especially right now. It gives a feeling of ‘We’re all in this together.’”  We may be all in this together, but we’re not equal. After all, celebs may be just like us, except they’re usually much richer. The new intimate view we have of the famous reveals a chasm: Bieber’s living room is large enough to fit several regular living rooms. Not everyone can self-isolate on a yacht.  A few weeks into the virus’ onslaught in America, some commentators had soured on the shenanigans of celebrities. “I don’t care what celebs are doing in their mansions,” one wrote on Instagram. Another posted a warning: “Funny how irrelevant they become when real problems curse us.”  The first real sign that celebrity exposure was curdling was when “Wonder Woman” star Gal Gadot led a sing-along of “Imagine” with such stars as James Marsden, Zoe Kravitz, Amy Adams and Mark Ruffalo. Pushback came quickly, with some commentators calling it “cringeworthy” and “out of touch.” They asked for donations, not songs.  Akshaya Sreenivasan, a social media marketing expert at Texas A&M University’s Mays Business School, says as the COVID-19 crisis drags on, celebrities are bound to face more online hate.  “Even Oprah is not going to be immune,” she says. “The big guys in Hollywood are going to be shredded to pieces, especially if they continue to post on Instagram, ‘Oh my God, I’m so bored. I’m drinking martinis in my private pool.’”  Sreenivasan anticipates some celebs will lose followers if they continue posting without sensitivity to the losses outside their mansions. And she thinks many will open their wallets to compensate for all the years of Instagram glam. “They need to do something to protect that brand,” she says.  There’s also danger if celebrities unartfully choose to profit off the virus. Social media experts warn that this may not be the time to be pushing products for gain.  Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson walks toward that line when he relentlessly floods his Instagram account to highlight and hype the brand of tequila he owns.  “You really need to be sensitive to your audience, and you need to be very careful if you want to walk that line,” says Schaffer. “It is a dangerous subject. A celebrity is only as good as their community. It can work against them as quickly as it works for them.”  Despite this new and unvarnished look at celebs and the pushback it has triggered, Sreenivasan is skeptical that anything will really change once normal life resumes.  “We’ve had this conversation forever,” she says. “We’re going to move on until the next problem comes, and we’ll have this inequality conversation again.”   ——  Follow AP Entertainment Writer Mark Kennedy on Twitter at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits  Mark Kennedy, The Associated Press  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 16, "positive": 22, "negative": 8, "disgust": 2, "joy": 4, "anger": 10, "fear": 5, "trust": 3}, "metadata": ["de", "coronavirus", "indian", "admits", "distancing", "media", "twitter", "ceo", "encourages", "suspects", "families", "onslaught", "texas", "crisis", "online", "warn", "pushing", "johnson", "floods", "ap", "writer"]}, {"text": "Private medical college hospitals in Telangana have agreed to provide up to 15,500 beds for treating coronavirus patients in response to a government request for ramping up the capacity to meet any situation.

Juventus’ home match against Lyon — also scheduled for Tuesday — was called off, too, as the coronavirus pandemic took its toll on leagues and cup competitions around the world, from Spain to the Netherlands to the United States.  The Spanish league was brought to halt for at least the next two rounds, shortly after Real Madrid announced its players had been put in quarantine. That decision was taken because one of the club’s basketball players, who share facilities with Madrid's soccer players, tested positive for the virus.  Hours later, UEFA said the City-Madrid game was postponed, with no new date arranged. City leads 2-1 from the first leg in Madrid.  At the same time, the Juventus match against Lyon was canceled because it was confirmed on Wednesday that a player from the Italian team, Daniele Rugani, tested positive for COVID-19.  Rugani, who also plays for the Italian national team, was the first player in the country's top soccer division to test positive for the disease. There was a second announced on Thursday — Sampdoria striker Manolo Gabbiadini.  “I’ve already received so very many messages. But I still want to reassure you that I'm fine, so don't worry,” Gabbiadini, who was in self-isolation, wrote on Twitter.  The outbreak of the virus has led to a nationwide lockdown in Italy, where soccer and all other sports have been suspended until April 3.  It’s not known when the Champions League will resume. UEFA, the governing body of European soccer, has called stakeholders to a meeting by video conference on Tuesday to deal with the effect on competitions of the coronavirus outbreak.  “All domestic and European competitions,” including this year's European Championship, will be discussed.  The World Health Organization labeled COVID-19 a pandemic, citing its alarming spread and severity. It has infected more then 125,000 people worldwide and caused more than 4,500 deaths since erupting in China.  For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover.  Only one Premier League game has been affected so far amid the outbreak, with Manchester City’s home match against Arsenal on Wednesday called off. That decision was taken after members of Arsenal's playing squad went into self-isolation in a precautionary move.  On Thursday, Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers said “a few” of his players have symptoms of coronavirus and were being kept away from the squad. Rodgers was speaking two days before Leicester plays Watford.  Chelsea underwent a deep clean of its training ground Thursday, meaning its players didn’t practice two days ahead of their Premier League game against Aston Villa. No Chelsea player has shown any symptoms of the virus.  Elsewhere, Dutch soccer authorities canceled all matches until the end of the month, including friendly internationals against the United States and Spain, while Portugal shut down it's league until further notice. The Belgian soccer league backpedaled on its decision to keep stadiums open to fans during the outbreak, saying the last round of regular-season matches in the top league scheduled for this weekend will be played in empty stadiums.  Major League Soccer in the United States was also shutting down for a 30-day period because of the virus.

The changes would protect tenants during the COVID-19 pandemic, and include a ban on evictions.

The minister said a decision had been taken to impose curfew in the one-kilometre radius to prevent the infection from spreading. People who live in this area have been told not to come out of their houses, he said. The three cases were reported in Jhunjhunu, about 140 km north of state capital Jaipur.  A state government official said the man, 33, his wife, 30, and their three-year-old daughter are being treated by a team of doctors.  Dr SK Kaler, Principal Medical Officer of Jhunjhunu district, told HT that the family had returned from Italy on March 8 and had been placed under observation.  “They showed symptoms of the virus and were admitted in the government hospital in Jhunjhunu on Tuesday. Their samples were taken on Tuesday and sent to SMS hospital in Jaipur for testing,” Dr Kaler said.  He described their condition of the three patients as stable.  That the family had been at home after their return sparked concerns about the possibility of the infection spreading and led chief minister Ashok Gehlot to hold a quick review meeting. Soon after, Gehlot announced the decision to impose prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the criminal procedure code.  Officials said the health department is trying to trace people who came in contact with the couple after their return.  SMS hospital medical superintendent Dr DS Meena, who confirmed that three samples had tested positive, said a medical board had been formed to assess the condition of patients.  Rajasthan had earlier reported four coronavirus cases including an Italian couple, part of a larger tourist group, who had tested positive for the virus on March 2.  An 85-year-old Jaipur resident who returned from Dubai also tested positive for the virus on February 28 and tested positive for the virus on March 9.  Doctors at SMS hospital claimed to have successfully treated the three coronavirus patients.  The fourth patient, a 24-year-old who returned from Spain, tested positive on March 14. He is also undergoing treatment at SMS hospital.  The doctors cured the patients by giving them a combination of drugs used to treat swine flu, malaria and HIV.  The ICMR has also approved the protocol followed by the doctors. Doctors from India and abroad have been in contact with the doctors at SMS to get information regarding the treatment regimen, said Dr Sudhir Bhandari, principal, SMS medical college.

Quinones says her son is no longer living at the Cambridge Oaks, private student apartments associated with the University of Houston, where he attends school. But she says they received a notice from Cambridge Oaks, informing them they have to pay rent through the end of the lease.  \"We have to pay all the way until the end of July, so we're paying over $2,000 for an apartment,\" she told us.

My husband just got laid off last Thursday,\" said Quinones.

But there is no reason it can't come to some kind of compromise,\" she said.  We asked the University of Houston about this issue. A spokesperson tells us these are privately owned apartments that set their own policies.  Cambridge Oaks said they will send us a statement, we'll pass it on to you when they do.  For students looking for refunds on canceled classes, here's an update from some local schools:  Rice University says it is not refunding tuition because classes are being held remotely but are offering pro-rated refunds on room and board.  The University of Houston says it's offering classes online and letting students stay in dorms. Those who choose to move out can get pro-rated refunds on dorms, meals, and parking.  Student loan borrowers are getting some relief.  The Department of Education started waiving interest on federal student loans for 60 days as of March 13. Borrowers can suspend payments for two months without additional interest. The DOE says those already delinquent are getting an automatic suspension of payments.  The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board's website says borrowers may be eligible for reduced or postponed payments. The Board is suspending collections on delinquent loans and waiving late fees.  Borrowers must contact your loan servicer to take advantage of these programs.  Since we reported this story, Cambridge Oaks sent us a statement over the weekend that reads in part:  “Although we lease land from the University of Houston, Cambridge Oaks is privately owned and operated. And unlike other on-campus residence halls at the University, we do not receive any state or federal funding. We rely on monthly installments from our residents to meet our financial obligations, including operational overhead costs and payroll for our staff.  We understand that some residents may be facing financial hardships during these unprecedented times. As a result, we will not be assessing any late fees for the month of April.

The impact of COVID-19 has left staffs scrambling to meet the needs of its players, keep track of academic performances, set up workout plans and a myriad of other agenda items. Yet, in a time of uncertainty those staffs have also been granted clock hours to build for the future.  \"This is a very unique time that we’re in. We’ve got a great opportunity as a staff to get ahead recruiting-wise, so we’re doing a lot of recruiting and maintaining structure and staying connected with our (current) players,\" Western Illinois head coach Jared Elliott said recently.  Knowing recruiting is the lifeblood of every football program no matter the size or level or conference affiliation, Prairie State Pigskin contacted staff members from each of the Illinois FCS schools — Eastern, Illinois State, Southern and Western — to gain insight on this spring's changing landscape.  With geographically better early spring weather, SIU has traditionally opened its practices sooner than the other schools. That held true this year as head coach Nick Hill's Salukis were able to get in five such practices before the pandemic shut things down. SIU was also able to hold a junior day for the high school class of 2021.  \"We had over 120 kids on campus,\" SIU recruiting coordinator Gaizka Crowley said. \"That was a really good event for us. Along with those five practices, that gave us a jump start. A lot of programs weren't able to get any in.\"  Crowley added that once Hill's staff had its current roster set up for distance learning, workouts and other priorities, SIU turned its attention to recruiting.  \"For me in my position, it's hog heaven a little bit, being able to watch a ton of guys and speak to high school coaches and speak to a lot of prospects,\" Crowley said.  Changing a negative into a positive  Adam Cushing has entered his second year as Eastern Illinois head coach. Despite not getting a chance to put his young team (which by fall will be 85 percent of his staff's recruits) through much-needed spring practices, Cushing leans toward optimism.  \"Our approach to this whole situation is, what does this make possible? Flip it from a challenge to an opportunity,\" Cushing said. \"We’ve been given time; nobody ever gives you time. Let’s use that time to be detailed about all the things we really want to be detailed on.\"  One of those things that he's detailed on is his staff's rankings of potential recruits.  \"I generally know about the top five guys on the board by position, but now we’ll have a much deeper board,\" he said.  Deeper connections and closer looks  Every coach interviewed discussed the opportunity to establish stronger bonds with possible future players.  \"We’ll have much deeper connection if we can stress daily connection,\" Cushing said. \"As crazy as it it is, (during the past) you’d be fighting to get the prospective student-athlete, the high school kid, that you want to get on the phone with because he’s a football guy, but he’s also in track and he’s a 4.0 student. You don’t want to take a lot of his time, but (now) he’s got a whole bunch of time too. If you can set it up right, you can really be maximizing relationships on a daily basis.\"  Khenon Hall coaches running backs at Illinois State. He is also head coach Brock Spack's recruiting coordinator.  \"With Coach Spack we’re usually pretty much ahead, but this has cleared up some extra time and allowed us to reevaluate some guys that fit what we want, what we’re looking for this year. We have a big senior class this year so we’re probably going to have a big signing class. It’s actually been a blessing to sit back, reorganize and hone in on the guys that are our top targets and the guys that fit the ISU program,\" Hall said.   No on-campus visits  The NCAA has declared a \"dead period,\" meaning that no recruits can make visits to campus nor can any coaches take to the road in attempts to land potential recruits. Thus, recruiting may look a little different for those 2021 signees.  \"For us, it's allowed Coach Hill, myself and our other staff to develop relationships with those kids because normally we'd be in spring practice right now,\" Crowley said. \"While we may potentially miss seeing a kid for in-person evaluation depending on how your (high school) camp schedule lays out, what it's honestly allowing you to do is to get to know a kid better on a one-on-one basis . . . we've been able to watch a ton of film, but even more importantly than the film is getting to know the kids. Getting them on the phone, talking to parents. We've been able to do that quite a bit.\"  Hall said, \"Letters, phone calls, FaceTime, whatever we’ve got to do in order to continue to build that relationship.\"  Illinois recruiting analyst \"Edgy\" Tim O'Halloran said in a Tuesday YouTube video, \"Basically March has become the new May, meaning the spring evaluation period is such a busy, busy time for recruiting on a lot of different levels. All this has done is pushed things forward and pushed the calendar back even further. Now you have college coaches looking . . . Something we've noticed this past week, all of the sudden multiple, multiple FCS schools are offering a lot more kids. More than I can remember at this time of the year in particular.\"   An added bonus?  Nearly all recruiting experts rate the state's 2021 class higher than the recent 2020 signees. Could the cornavirus actually help keep more of those recruits here in Illinois?  \"It helps us a lot. Chicago, especially the ‘21 (class), is better than last year as far as the talent goes,\" Hall said. \"We take care of our backyard, but now the kids that are getting attention from the out-of-state areas can’t go to those campuses, or they might have early offers from these MAC schools in Ohio or Michigan or wherever.  \"Now, they can’t get to those campuses, but they’ve probably been to ours. We are one of the top schools in the state and country, so we’re able to get some of those guys that tend to go to that MAC area. Now we’re going to be able to keep those guys home.\"  Crowley added, \"We're in the middle of everything. We're in the middle of Atlanta, Chicago, Indianapolis, Memphis, St. Louis, so we're able to get a lot of kids on campus. With potentially the spring and summer camp season being very much in the air, you've got a lot of kids that (normally) go to the one-day camps, put on a great performance and that's when they earn a lot of offers. From our perspective, can you go up and grab a kid who's a Group of Five kid or even a Power-5 kid? I think that's very much a reality.  \"It's uncharted territory. How does it (COVID-19) affect commitments? How does it affect the December signing day? Last year we signed a huge majority of our class in December; now does that change? What's the impact? Are more kids now going to sign in February so they can take more visits? That's very much a possibility.

The new coronavirus made Dr. Jag Singh a patient at his own hospital. His alarm grew as he saw an X-ray of his pneumonia-choked lungs and colleagues asked his wishes about life support while wheeling him into Massachusetts General’s intensive care unit.  When they offered him a chance to help test remdesivir, an experimental drug that’s shown promise against some other coronaviruses, “it did not even cross my mind once to say ‘no,’” said Singh, a heart specialist.  Coronavirus patients around the world have been rushing to join remdesivir studies that opened in hospitals in the last few weeks.  Interest has been so great that the U.S. National Institutes of Health is expanding its study, which has nearly reached its initial goal of 440 patients. The drug’s maker, California-based Gilead Sciences, is quickly ramping up its own studies, too.  “I would enroll my family in a heartbeat” if the need arose, said Dr. Libby Hohmann, who placed Singh and nearly 30 others in the NIH one at Mass General. To have no approved medicines for COVID-19 now is “kind of terrifying,” she said.  For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough but sometimes pneumonia requiring hospitalization. The risk of death is greater for older adults and people with other health problems.  Remdesivir is given through an IV. It’s designed to interfere with an enzyme that reproduces viral genetic material.  In animal tests against SARS and MERS, diseases caused by similar coronaviruses, the drug helped prevent infection and reduced the severity of symptoms when given early enough in the course of illness. It’s farther along in testing than many other potential therapies and the current studies could lead to regulatory approval.  Gilead has given remdesivir to more than 1,700 patients on a case-by-case emergency basis, but more people ultimately will be helped if the company does the needed studies to prove safety and effectiveness, chief executive Dan O’Day wrote in a recent letter to the public.  “Many people have reached out to Gilead to advocate for access to remdesivir on behalf of friends and loved ones. I can only imagine how it must feel to be in that situation,” he wrote. “We are taking the ethical, responsible approach.”  In another letter on Saturday, O'Day said the company has 1.5 million doses, which could mean more than 140,000 treatment courses, depending on how long treatment needs to last. The company is providing the drug for free for now and has set a goal of making 500,000 treatment courses by October and more than a million by the end of the year.  Gilead supplied remdesivir for two studies in China expected to give results by the end of the month. It also launched two studies for hospitalized patients in the U.S., Asia, Europe and elsewhere. One in severely ill patients tests five versus 10 days of treatment. Another in moderately sick patients compares those two options to standard care alone.  “There’s so much anxiety about the disease that the patients are quite interested” and no one offered the chance has refused, said Dr. Arun Sanyal, the study leader at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond.  The first patient he enrolled was a previously healthy middle-aged man who had an out-of-state visitor a few days before his symptoms began. What started as mild illness escalated to profound shortness of breath requiring supplemental oxygen.  At University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Dr. Grace McComsey has enrolled roughly half a dozen patients.  “We’re seeing more and more younger people, like 30, really sick,” she said.  The NIH study is the most rigorous test. It compares remdesivir to placebo infusions, and neither patients nor doctors know who is getting what until the end of the study. Besides the U.S., it's open in Japan, Korea and Singapore.  In Chicago, an 89-year-old man was Northwestern Memorial Hospital’s first participant and “the family was very excited” to have him included, said infectious diseases chief Dr. Babafemi Taiwo.  At the University of California, Irvine, Dr. Alpesh Amin has enrolled several patients. All are getting standard care even if they wind up getting a placebo rather than remdesivir, Amin said.  The Boston cardiologist, Singh, said he was willing to take that chance to advance science even if he personally winds up not benefiting. He's now recovering at home after spending a week in the hospital.  “The word ‘placebo’ freaks some people out,” but rigorous testing is needed to avoid giving false hope or using something unsafe. Still, it’s tough to face patients with no proven therapy now, Hohmann said.  “The worst thing is seeing some really young people who are really, really sick,” such as a 49-year-old man with three young children on life support, she said. “That’s pretty awful.”   ___  Marilynn Marchione can be followed on Twitter: @MMarchioneAP   ___  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 21, "positive": 17, "negative": 3, "sadness": 1, "disgust": 3, "joy": 1, "anger": 6, "surprise": 3, "fear": 9, "trust": 2}, "metadata": ["remdesivir", "studies", "china", "coronavirus", "massachusetts", "medicines", "mild", "cough", "pneumonia", "viral", "sars", "diseases", "symptoms", "dan", "severely", "ill", "compares", "options", "virginia", "university", "korea", "infectious", "children"]}, {"text": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) has categorised the coronavirus outbreak as an epidemic (Photo: Getty Images)  The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus strain Covid-19 a pandemic on March 11.  \"We have called every day for countries to take urgent and aggressive action.

What is a pandemic?  The WHO defines a pandemic as the worldwide spread of a new disease, across several countries or continents, affecting a large number of people.  A viral outbreak could be categorised as a pandemic if it is markedly different from recently circulating strains, and if humans have little or no immunity to it, according to the UK’s Health and Safety Executive.   What is an epidemic?  In contrast, an epidemic refers to a more localised or regional outbreak of a disease, rather than one that has spread across the globe.  It is an increase - often sudden - in the number of cases of a disease that is above what is normally expected in that population in that area, according to the Centers for Disease and Control Prevention (CDC).  The CDC explains that an epidemic may result from:  A recent increase in amount or virulence of the agentThe recent introduction of the agent into a setting where it has not been beforeAn enhanced mode of transmission so that more susceptible persons are exposedA change in the susceptibility of the host response to the agentFactors that increase host exposure or involve introduction through new portals of entry  Why so long to declare pandemic?  Though the disease spread beyond China in January, WHO have refrained from describing the disease as pandemic until now.  That's because the virus spread beyond the origin country had not yet been sustained for a significant amount of time.

It’s very clean. The staff is wonderful.”  What was once a haven for Bruce turned into a nightmare.  New Jersey's veterans homes at Menlo Park and Paramus have been thrown into chaos in recent weeks as the coronavirus has ripped through the facilities, infecting 241 residents and killing 70, including Bruce on April 11.  While New Jersey nursing homes have been hit hard by the coronavirus, with residents accounting for 41 percent of the state's 4,377 deaths, residents at state-run veterans homes have taken the brunt.  Buy Photo Exterior photo of the New Jersey Veterans Home in Paramus, NJ on 04/13/20. (Photo: Mitsu Yasukawa/ Northjersey.com)  The Paramus home has the most deaths and infections of any nursing facility in New Jersey, with 44 deaths and 155 confirmed cases, according to state data released Monday. Menlo Park, which has 86 cases, is third-highest in the state, with 26 deaths.  A third state-run veterans home in Vineland, Cumberland County, has had only one confirmed case and no deaths. South Jersey has far fewer coronavirus cases overall.  Since NorthJersey.com and the USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey broke the story this month of the death toll at the Paramus home, some families have described a precipitous decline in care and a near-blackout of communications from the facilities as the coronavirus crisis ramped up.  Part of that has been due to staff shortages during the crisis that prompted Gov. Phil Murphy to send in National Guard medics and dozens of federal Veterans Affairs nurses to assist.  Dr. Mark Piterski, deputy commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, said last week that agency executives and staff are \"committed to ensuring that all veterans and their families are treated with dignity and respect.”  Staff at the homes, who have requested anonymity, said they have been overwhelmed. They said no service training was held to prepare for the pandemic, and workers initially were told not to wear masks, gowns or gloves because it would scare the residents. Some brought their own protective gear.  Nursing homes: NJ names 425 nursing homes, facilities with coronavirus outbreaks  Honoring veterans: At NJ Veterans Home stricken with coronavirus deaths, a Boy Scout plays nightly tribute  Kryn Westhoven, a spokesman for the veterans department, said the outbreak has required an \"all hands on deck approach to the provision of care,\" which may cause delays in getting information to families.  \"Families should know that the degree of care and compassion for their loved ones has not changed,\" Westhoven said. \"All residents have received the best possible care that the homes can provide during this global pandemic that has hit nursing homes and long-term care facilities especially hard.\"  Indeed, some families of deceased residents said they were consistently in contact with nurses and doctors in their loved ones' last days.  But many other families say the homes crumbled under the sheer weight of an outbreak for which they were woefully unprepared.  Here are some of their stories:   Vernon Peck  Vernon Peck, 74, a resident of the New Jersey Veterans Home at Menlo Park, died from COVD-19 in April 2020. Here he is months before at his daughter's wedding. (Photo: Courtesy of the Peck family)  Vernon Peck surprised everyone at his daughter's wedding a few months ago when he rolled his wheelchair onto the dance floor and started spinning around with wild ebullience.  When he returned to the Menlo Park veterans home, the staff had never seen him so happy.  \"They said he was smiling for days,\" said Kim, his only child.  Vernon, 74, saw combat during the Vietnam War before he was called home because his father had died.  He was married for 20 years and, though it ended in divorce, his ex-wife remained his best friend. Vernon was a systems analyst for McGraw Hill in Mercer County until he had a debilitating stroke in 1997.  Although partially paralyzed on his right side, he could walk with help. But subsequent seizures and age made him dependent on a motorized wheelchair. He also lost the ability to speak coherently, but he could comprehend language and knew his surroundings.  In May 2011, he moved into the Menlo Park home. He made a lot of friends, including Ruth Lincoln, whom he married while the two were residents. They shared a room until she died a few years ago.  His ex-wife would visit him regularly, doing his laundry and advocating on his behalf. \"He was still able to answer yes or no, so my mom would pepper him with 50 questions to find out what was going on,\" Kim said.  Vernon Peck, 74, a resident of the New Jersey Veterans Home in Menlo Park, died of COVID-19 in April 2020. (Photo: Courtesy of the Peck family)  On April 2, the nursing staff told the family that Vernon had a fever as high as 102 degrees. Since he had a long history of urinary tract infections, Kim thought that might be the reason.  The staff did not give him a COVID-19 test pending the result of his urinalysis, which took two or three days. Kim got hold of Elizabeth Schiff-Heedles, the facility's CEO, and asked for a COVID test. Schiff-Heedles said it wasn't yet necessary because a chest X-ray showed his lungs were clear, Kim said.  A few days later, the family was told Vernon would be put in quarantine with other COVID-19 patients.  “I was furious about that, because to our knowledge he was still being treated for a UTI,\" Kim said. \"He was being sent in with COVID patients and you don’t know that he’s COVID-positive. It was insane.  \"We were just praying he'd be OK,” Kim said. \"We were at their mercy.\"  Staff assured Kim that her dad would be isolated in his own room. But her mom called Vernon on April 6 and heard someone coughing incessantly in the background. Kim said she and her mother received conflicting information as to whether Vernon had a COVID-positive roommate. To this day, they don't know.  On April 7, Vernon’s doctor at the facility told Kim that her dad was presumptive positive based on his symptoms. “He said that a test wasn’t required since it was obvious he had it,” Kim said. \"All we knew is he had a temperature, nothing more.\"  A terrible mistake: A family was told their dad at Paramus vets home was rebounding from COVID. He had died hours earlier  COVID-19 related deaths: Nursing homes throughout Northeast become Achilles' heel as thousands die from coronavirus  Vernon’s condition worsened. He was placed on tube feeding. He had stopped answering his cellphone. His pulse rate and oxygen levels fell.  On April 11, the doctor called to tell them Vernon was being taken to JFK Medical Center in Edison. He tested positive for COVID-19.  He was soon placed in the hospital's hospice care. Kim spoke to him on FaceTime that Saturday evening. She knew it would be the last time she would speak to him.  \"I apologized profusely that I couldn’t be there,\" Kim said. \"I told him this is not how I wanted it to be. I told him I was so sorry that I couldn’t do more for him. I told him that he had tried to stick it out as hard as he could and that it was OK to go.”  She told her dad that she loved him. She said goodbye. The phone call ended. Her dad was unconscious throughout the conversation.  Vernon Peck died hours later on April 12, Easter morning.  \"When they came out in March telling us they were barring visitors, they should have sent out a letter about what the policies and procedures would be in place to test residents and how to deal with COVID-19 patients,\" Kim said. \"We didn't get anything, and from dealing with the staff there didn't appear to be any. Nobody seemed to know what was going on.\"  When the outbreak is over and social distancing is lifted, Kim plans to have a service at Emmanuel Baptist Church in Manville.  Until then, she will keep her dad's ashes with her.  \"He'll be coming home,\" Kim said. \"We couldn’t say goodbye. But we can keep him close to us.\"   Bruce Sernyik  Bruce Sernyik, 66, a resident of the New Jersey Veterans Memorial Home at Menlo Park, died in April from complications from COVID-19. (Photo: Courtesy of Bruce Sernyik's family.)  The last time Charlene Vogel saw her brother Bruce Sernyik, she was yelling \"happy birthday\" to him through the lobby windows at the New Jersey Veterans Memorial Home at Menlo Park.  It was March 14, and the facility had barred visitors to help stem the spread of coronavirus. A bright, silver balloon was tied to his chair — something the staff did for everyone on their birthday.  At 66, Bruce was one of the younger residents.  He had served as a data processing technician in the Navy for 2½ years in the 1970s before a nervous breakdown ended his career, Charlene said. Bruce was diagnosed with schizophrenia and honorably discharged in 1979.  Controlling his disorder was tough, and Bruce spent most of his adult years living with his mother at his childhood home in South River.  Bruce had a history of heart problems and was hospitalized after his mom died in 2018.  Charlene began looking for a nursing home and set her sights on Menlo Park, a facility in high demand. It had been built in 1999 and featured 109 bucolic acres. She felt relieved when a spot opened in May 2019.  Bruce loved it, too. He made friends. He went on trips to Mets games and Atlantic City casinos. He enjoyed the arts and crafts. He was happy to attend Mass each week in the chapel.

(Photo: Courtesy of Bruce Sernyik's family.)  Charlene visited Bruce several times a week, sometimes with a homemade meal.  So when the facility barred visitors because of the coronavirus, she felt anxiety — but believed her brother was in good hands. For nearly a month, she was in regular contact with the nurses and social workers.  But something changed two weeks ago. She had difficulty getting anyone on the phone.  “I had no idea what was happening to my brother, and I was scared,” Charlene said.  By April 9, she was calling every number she had for anyone connected to the facility. She called the local health department and the Medicare offices.  Finally, Charlene got through to a nurse, who set up a video call via FaceTime. She was shocked to see that her brother was lethargic and dressed in nothing but a Cal Ripken Orioles jersey and an adult diaper. “They knew he was sick and they kept telling him to sit up and talk,” Charlene said.  Later that evening his condition deteriorated and he was sent to JFK Medical Center in Edison. The next day, Bruce's COVID-19 test came back positive.  Charlene was told that her brother was in restraints because he had become delirious and was trying to pull out an IV line. She FaceTimed with him later in the day, and he seemed better.  But at 1:32 a.m. on April 11, she received a call that Bruce had died.  Charlene doesn't fault the nurses or other staffers at the home, because they're overwhelmed.  But the lack of communication was inexcusable, as was the lack of COVID-19 testing, she said.  \"I had no idea what was happening to my brother for days,\" she said. \"And then when I do finally get in touch with him, he’s already sick, very sick.  \"They needed to test everyone at that home a month ago — all residents, all staff,\" she said. \"This is the most vulnerable population that you can possibly have. They should have known this virus would hit hard here. They should have been better prepared.\"  Story continues below the gallery  Westhoven said the homes have operated and continue to operate in conformance with state and federal guidelines for testing. \"Testing is performed at the order of the attending physician/medical director when he or she feels it is necessary to test a resident,\" he said.  Bruce was buried at Washington Monumental Cemetery in South River in a small ceremony on Wednesday. A neighbor played taps on a bugle from afar.  Charlene said she would rather remember her brother when she saw him for the last time from behind the windows, looking happy.  \"I'll always remember him,\" she said, \"wheeling around with that Mylar balloon floating behind him.\"   Marie Dragan  Buy Photo Exterior photo of the New Jersey Veterans Home in Paramus, NJ on 04/13/20. (Photo: Mitsu Yasukawa/ Northjersey.com)  Marie Dragen, 94, was on the waiting list to get into the Paramus veterans home for eight months, which her son John considered \"a relatively short time\" for the in-demand facility.  A homemaker who raised four children, Marie was eligible for the veterans home through her husband Nicholas, an Army Air Corps veteran of World War II who became a decorated Hackensack police officer.  In recent years she suffered from COPD — a disease that obstructs airflow from the lungs, making breathing difficult. The disease got worse as Marie grew older and forced John to take her to the ER.  John tried to keep his mom at the Hackensack home they shared with aides, but money was dwindling and John said an application for help to the Bergen County Board of Social Services was turned down.  Marie moved into the Paramus home two years ago. John visited his mom every weekday and paid a personal aide $1,200 a month to supplement Marie's care on weekends. John said the care could be spotty, as the aide sometimes complained to nurses about diaper rashes.  But John and the aide were barred from entering the home in March, as were all visitors, to avoid spreading the virus.  He spoke to his mom every day and she sounded fine until March 31, when a nurse called and said Marie's oxygen levels were low. Knowing how vulnerable Marie was because of her COPD, John asked that she be sent immediately to the hospital. He was told it wasn't necessary yet.  Westhoven said residents are sent to the hospital upon the recommendation of the medical staff. \"Not all residents that test positive for COVID-19 will require hospitalization,\" he said. \"However, when a resident’s condition worsens to the point where the staff believes that acute care is necessary, the appropriate action is taken in consultation with the attending physician or medical director.\"  The next day, Marie never woke up. John was told she was in a coma. Only then was she taken to Hackensack University Medical Center.  At the emergency room, a doctor told John that Marie was likely COVID-positive and there was nothing they could do. She was dying. Through tears, John asked to see her. He was told it was too risky. He might become infected. But he demanded. And they relented.  John's temperature was taken. He was dressed in a medical gown, mask and gloves. He went into a room with his unconscious mom just off the ER floor and spent nine hours there.  \"I just sat there and talked to her,\" John said.  Marie Dragan died the next night, April 2. She was buried in St. Joseph's Cemetery in Hackensack, the city where she lived for 70 years, where her four kids grew up and where her late husband patrolled the streets.  John said the Paramus home should have protected his mom better, given her COPD.  \"They needed to isolate the people who were sick right when they showed symptoms,\" he said. \"And they should have taken her to the hospital sooner. She had no chance by the time they took her.\"  Scott Fallon covers the environment for NorthJersey.com.

Merlo said, “As they continue to be there for the individuals and families we serve, we’re taking extra steps to provide some peace of mind and help them navigate these uncertain times.”  Other changes at the company include:  • Launching a new offering to help employees with both child and elder or adult dependent care needs  • Making 24 hours of paid sick leave available to part-time employees for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. The leave is in addition to the 14-day paid leave the company provides for employees who tests positive for the new coronavirus.  In addition to rewarding current employees the company has started a hiring drive — with plans to fill 50,000 full-time, part-time and temporary roles across the country.  Given the varying shelter in place and self-quarantine orders in cities and states, CVS officials say they will utilize a technology-enabled hiring process that includes virtual job fairs, virtual interviews and virtual job tryouts.

(WKRG) — Auburn University is recalling students studying abroad and suspending international travel in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.  The university released the following statement Monday:  Auburn University is recalling all of its travel abroad students and suspending all official international travel for students, faculty and staff until further notice given the global outbreak of COVID-19.  Auburn officials report taking this action out of an abundance of caution for safety and following the guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The decision comes on the heels of a new CDC advisory that asks institutions of higher education to consider postponing or canceling upcoming student foreign exchange programs. Auburn abroad programs currently span the globe throughout Europe, Asia, South and Central America, Australia and the Pacific Islands as well as Africa and the West Indies. The recall will begin immediately and will be undertaken as carefully as possible.  “Our number one goal is the safety and well-being of our students,” said Bill Hardgrave, Auburn’s provost and senior vice president for academic affairs. “We are aware of how this recall impacts programming for those students currently abroad and for those who have trips planned in the coming months. We are making provisions for students affected to continue their coursework.”  Prior to this latest decision involving travel abroad programs, Auburn had already temporarily suspended all university travel to China, Italy, Iran and South Korea due to the coronavirus. That decision included official travel for students, faculty and staff. In advance of Auburn’s spring break during the week of March 9-13, Auburn officials are also urging caution for those planning travel abroad during that time.  “Students, faculty and staff should be aware of the potential implications of international travel,” said Dr. Fred Kam, medical director for the Auburn University Medical Clinic. “We strongly discourage personal travel to any country classified by the CDC as a level 3 risk for COVID-19. Beyond that, we urge everyone to seriously consider the possibility of quarantines or restricted travel back to the United States for any trips outside the country.”  The CDC maintains a website outlining travel warnings and alerts for airline and cruise ship travel to specific countries, as it relates to potential coronavirus exposure. Upon return, students, faculty and staff who have reason to believe they may have been exposed or have symptoms associated with the coronavirus, should call the Auburn University Medical Clinic at 334-844-6125 before visiting the clinic. Afterhours or on weekends, they should call 334-749-3411 before going to the ER at East Alabama Medical Center.  Auburn President Jay Gogue established a group of campus leaders, including heath experts, emergency management personnel and others, to plan for how this evolving situation with COVID-19 could continue to impact the university. Currently, there are no known cases in the state of Alabama; however, the CDC expects the number of cases in the U.S. to rise. To keep the campus community informed, the university has created a COVID-19 website for updates and answers to common questions about COVID-19 and its impacts.

OKLAHOMA CITY (KFOR) – According to the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission, the number of initial unemployment insurance claims dipped slightly from the previous week as COVID-19 pandemic continues.  From April 5 to April 11, unadjusted initial claims in Oklahoma totaled 48,977, a decrease of 11,557 from the previous record-setting adjusted week high of 60,534, revised up from the initially reported total of 47,744.  OESC says nationally, the seasonally adjusted initial claims totaled 5,245,000, a decrease of 1,370,000 from the previous week’s revised level of 6,615,000. The advance seasonally adjusted insured unemployment rate for the country was 8.2 percent for the week ending April 4, up 3.1 percent and the highest seasonally adjusted rate since the previous high of 7.0 percent in May 1975.  “Our numbers for last week are still extraordinarily high as additional employers cut staff and implemented layoffs to adjust to this dramatic downturn in the economy,” said OESC Executive Director Robin Roberson. “As an agency responsible for connecting displaced workers with unemployment benefits, we continue to make tremendous strides is disbursing funds to provide relief.”  The agency now has around 1,200 claims representatives manning the call center and the online chat feature, including 200 Tier 2 specialists to handle escalated claims with eligibility or other issues.  The call drop-off rate has fallen below one percent.  Out of work Oklahomans are encouraged to first file initial claims online as this remains the fastest way to file a claim. A new mobile app is nearing completion and will soon be available as another tool for claimants to file a claim, submit eligibility documentation, and otherwise communicate with OESC.  “The ability to assist individuals who don’t qualify for regular unemployment benefits or have exhausted their benefits will be available as soon as Oklahoma receives the go ahead for release and processing of Pandemic Unemployment Assistance claims,” Roberson said. “We remain optimistic these funds will be available this week to assist gig workers, independent contractors, and other self-employed individuals seeking relief.”  The national weekly seasonally adjusted initial claims report is one of ten components in the Composite Index of Leading Economic Indicators. To smooth out the volatility in the weekly initial claims data, a 4-week moving average is used to assess trends.  In Oklahoma, the less volatile initial claims four-week moving average climbed 11,785 to 44,975 for the week ending on April 11.  The advance unadjusted number for continued claims totaled 87,512, an increase of 32,483 from the previous week. The continued four-week moving average increased 17,758 to 46,166.  While the number of unemployed Oklahomans has topped 200,000 since mid-March, many employers urgently need workers. L  You can look for jobs here.

According to multiple reports, the man who contracted New Hampshire's first case of coronavirus — formally known as COVID-19 — decided to go with the second option.  The New York Times reported Thursday that the patient in question was an employee of the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire. After being examined last Friday by a medical worker due to signs of possible coronavirus infection — i.e., flu-like symptoms following a trip to virus-affected Italy — doctors recommended that he quarantine himself while waiting for further medical testing.  But rather than following that advice, the Times reported, the patient went to a mixer for doctors and college students that very night and was confirmed as having the virus days later. Following his social foray, the partygoer has been ordered into quarantine by the state's health commissioner.  \"The individual is complying now,\" New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services Communications Director Jake Leon said, according to the Times.  According to WBTS-TV, the invitation-only mixer was held at The Engine Room, which is an event space just across the New Hampshire state border in neighboring Vermont. The venue's general manager told the news station that there had been between 175 and 200 people at the event, plus seven staff members working there.  In response to the news, the Vermont Department of Health put out a statement Tuesday saying that it had worked with the venue \"to ensure proper cleaning and sanitizing efforts were carried out to prevent spread\" of the virus.  In the news release, Vermont Health Commissioner Mark Levine, noted that, due to \"minimal possible contact with a case,\" people who attended the event \"are still considered to be at low risk for infection, but out of an abundance of caution the department is seeking contact from anyone in attendance.\"  \"Any people determined to have been in close contact with the patient have been identified and are being notified,\" the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services said in a news release Tuesday. \"DHHS recommends that those individuals self-quarantine for 14 days after the day they were potentially exposed.\"  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 8, "positive": 15, "negative": 3, "anger": 1, "surprise": 1, "fear": 6}, "metadata": ["coronavirus", "symptoms", "italy", "quarantine", "college", "students", "virus", "state's", "ensure", "self-quarantine"]}, {"text": "LACEFIELD, III, Dr. William Otis \"Billy\" Dr. William Otis Lacefield, III (\"Billy\"), 52 of Atlanta, GA passed away on Monday, March 23, 2020. Billy was born in Louisville, KY and grew up in Louisville and Macon, GA. He graduated from Southwest High School in Macon in 1985. He graduated magna cum laude with his bachelor's degree in mathematics from Mercer University in 1989, then earned post-baccalaureate certification in early childhood education from Georgia College and State University in 1990. He earned a master's degree in curriculum and instruction from the University of Southern Mississippi in 1993, a specialist in education degree in early childhood education from Mercer in 1995, and a doctorate in curriculum studies from Georgia Southern University in 1999. After teaching elementary school in Bibb County for seven years while serving as an adjunct instructor at Mercer, Billy joined the Mercer faculty full-time in 1997 as Instructor of Mathematics Education and Middle Grades Education. He was granted tenure in 2003 and promoted to Full Professor in 2009. One Mercer colleague described Billy as a \"gentle genius,\" stating that \"Mercer students loved him for his ability to skillfully teach challenging courses with such gentle kindness.\" Billy sought to build positive attitudes toward mathematics, and in addition to his work at Mercer he privately tutored hundreds of learners of all ages and at all levels from young children to senior citizens, from counting to calculus. He received numerous awards and accolades for his incomparable work inside and outside the classroom. Perhaps most notably, Billy was a recent recipient of the highly prestigious Hendricks Award, which recognizes a full-time teacher who best exemplifies the qualities that distinguished Joe and Jean Hendricks as teachers and mentors to generations of Mercer students. These include challenging and inspiring teaching in and out of the classroom, active engagement of students in the process of learning, discovery and leadership, as well as caring mentoring to motivate students and junior faculty to achieve their highest aspirations. Billy was a self-described anglophile and enjoyed many visits to Britain with his husband Michael, but not only for leisure. Billy took his passion for math, teaching and life-long learning with him and explored comparative mathematics education in England and the United States, and unsurprisingly made scores of friends in the process. His loved ones local and abroad will miss his contagious smile and laugh, his kindness and gentleness, his generosity and passion. As one friend put it, \"Billy never subtracted or divided people but only added and multiplied love and encouragement. The sum of Billy is what we all strive to be.\" Billy was preceded in death by his father William O. Lacefield, Jr. and several grandparents including his beloved grandmother Mary Brian. He is survived by his loving husband Michael Petway of Atlanta, step-children Davis Petway (Justin Gray) of Wilton Manors, FL and Ben Petway of Atlanta, mother Maria Clance, sister Stacy Amerson (Barry) and nieces Vada Amerson and Cassidy Amerson, all of Macon. Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, a celebration of life will be held at a later date for all friends and family. A private graveside service will be held on Saturday, March 28, 2020.

The innovative makeshift facilities are being used across the world and there are now 15 of them in Ontario.  The William Osler Assessment Centre in the parking lot outside Etobicoke General Hospital is seeing hundreds of drivers a day, with cars lining up around the lot and beyond.  Donna Moore, the manager of the centre, says the facility is quick, efficient and safe — which is encouraging more patients to get tested.  “Patients don’t have to get out of their car. They can drive up, they can have an assessment and drive out,” she says.  Moore adds that it also helps alleviate people’s fears as many are hesitant to visit hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The drive-throughs also have the added benefit of reducing the volume of patients in emergency rooms and stemming the surge there.  Demand at the centre has grown exponentially — from just 40 cars a day when it first opened in March to almost 200 on Monday. The wait to be seen can be up to two hours on busy days, but Moore says on most days the wait is under a hour.  The medical professionals working at the drive-through include physicians, surgeons, nurses and other staff from various departments and different sites under the William Osler umbrella. They’ve had to adapt quickly to outdoor working conditions, staying warm under heat lamps and contending with wind, rain and various other environmental factors.  “I think the right word is surreal,” says anesthesiologist Darren Ezer, who can usually be found in an operating room. “But this is where the need is, this is where my help is required so this is where I’m going to be.”  Registered Practical Nurse Gagandeep Grewal admits that at first, she was hesitant to join the team at the drive-through centre. She usually works at a referral site with only other staff members and this role would see her facing the general public.  “But working here has been a really good experience. Today it’s cold, but the managers have all of us taken care of,” she says, adding that the process is streamlined and feels safe and efficient.  When people arrive at the testing centre, they go through the following steps:   Register with security  Drive up to the tent  Get assessed by a doctor or nurse  If approved for a swab test, a nurse will administer a nose swab  Receive an information sheet on how to get results   Drive away  Moore says medical staff maintain physical distancing by assessing people from the passenger’s side. In addition, they’re not in a confined space with potential patients, which makes them more comfortable.  “I have people asking ‘do you need anybody else?’ — I have other people who actually want to come and work here,” says Moore. “That means staff feel safe and comfortable working here, which is very important.”  The province is now conducting approximately 9,000 tests a day and drive-through centres are part of the 100 assessment centres set up across Ontario.  Close to 175,000 tests have been conducted in the province to date and the government says it wants to ramp up testing to 14,000 a day by the end of April.

Gerard Gallant, fired mid-season by the Vegas Golden Knights, has interviewed for the Devils job in recent weeks. The news was first reported by Pierre LeBrun and has been confirmed by Sportsnet.  Devils interim coach Alain Nasreddine, who took the reins from the fired John Hynes on Dec. 3, still remains a contender for the position as well.  Regardless if the 2019-20 regular season can be salvaged from the COVID-19 pandemic, New Jersey’s interim general manager Tom Fitzgerald is overseeing a lottery-bound franchise and working with an eye toward 2020-21.  “My job is to lead the hockey ops department until told otherwise,” Fitzgerald said on an April 16 conference call. “All I’m trying to do right now is continue to do the job and not think of the what-ifs, because I just think that can’t muddy the waters and distract an individual.”  A hockey lifer, Gallant was stunned by his firing, which came after two-and-a-half successful seasons with the Knights, with the club still firmly in the Pacific Division hunt. He was slated to coach the division’s all-star squad at the time.  The 56-year-old has amassed an NHL career record of 270-216-4-51 as bench boss of the Columbus Blue Jackets, Florida Panthers, and Golden Knights.

The pressure is on for Smith, after the Wichita Falls City Council passed a shelter-in-place ordinance last Friday, closing all non-essential businesses, including nurseries.  “One thing we have to take into consideration is all of these plants that are ready for spring sales, many of them are in small pots, they will not be ready in July,” Smith said. “We will not be able to sell them then.

Images were posted on social media on Saturday showing shoppers clustered outside warehouses around the country amid the coronavirus pandemic.  Many customers claimed the stores were packed with people browsing the shelves despite restrictive measures where the public have been told to stay home to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  'Going to Bunnings on a Saturday in the current environment is about as stupid as licking the sweat off a sick person,' one tweet reads.  Bunnings stores across Australia have been packed with queuing customers despite social distancing measures  'So Bunnings is open for hundreds of people in a confined space, but sitting in the open air at a park is a no go? These rules are arbitrary and frankly a bit ridiculous,' another post reads.  Australians are only allowed to leave home to get food, travel for work or education, exercise, receive medical care or for compassionate needs during this time, leaving many wondering if shopping at Bunnings is essential.  'Absolutely nobody can tell me that everyone going to Bunnings is doing so for an essential reason,' another comment reads.  'Painting your house is not essential, buying potting mix is not essential. 70 per cent of people there are just taking the piss.'  Bunnings have implemented a wealth of changes in store to keep customers and staff safe during the coronavirus period.  They recently launched their Drive and Collect service at 250 stores around Australia, where customers can pick up their orders from the store car park with no contact between staff and customers.  Bunnings have made many changes to keep customers and staff safe while shopping for supplies in store, including implementing distancing measures in queues by marking the floors with tape. Pictured: a Bunnings store in Sydney on Saturday  Bunnings famous sausage sizzles have been suspended, with trade customers and health and emergency services workers able to shop without the public before 9am on weekdays.  Store cleaning procedures have been enhanced, with staff given gloves and hand sanitiser, while the floors have been taped to mark 1.5metre distance for customers to keep their space in store, with a limit on the number of customers allowed inside at any time.  Announcements are regularly made in store to remind customers to adhere to the procedures, while contactless payment methods are being encouraged.  'We’re taking a common-sense approach to finding ways to quickly adapt our business so that we can continue to safely serve our retail customers and enable tradies to keep their businesses running,' Bunnings Managing Director Mike Schneider said in a media release.  'As always, we will continue to follow government advice and will be guided by them as they work through this difficult time.

Bunnings stores are one of the few essential retailers that have been allowed to stay open during the coronavirus crisis, though the hardware giant was earmarked for closure if the Federal Government further tightened restrictions.  Non-essential services like pubs, beauty salons and gyms have been forced to close, while restaurants and cafes may only operate on a take-away basis.  Many online urged the public to use common sense before shopping in store during this time.

The economic and social impact of the pandemic is rapidly unfolding, with a contraction of output expected in 2020.  The IMF’s emergency support will provide additional resources for health services and social protection programs.  Today, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved the disbursement of SDR 95.680 million (about US$130 million) to be drawn under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF). The RCF funds will help address Mauritania’s urgent balance of payments need stemming from the COVID-19 crisis, estimated at close to US$370 million, thereby providing space to increase spending on health services and social protection programs. The funds should also help to catalyze additional donor support.  The economic and social impact of the crisis is expected to be substantial in Mauritania. The economy is currently projected to contract by 2 percent this year and the overall budget deficit could rise to 3.4 percent of GDP.  Following the Executive Board’s discussion, Mr. Mitsuhiro Furusawa, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, made the following statement:  “The COVID-19 pandemic is having a dramatic human, economic, and social impact on Mauritania. The short-term economic outlook has deteriorated rapidly and growth is expected to turn negative this year, with severe hardships for the population, and the outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty. These developments have given rise to urgent balance of payment and fiscal financing needs.  “The authorities have responded swiftly with measures to contain the pandemic and alleviate its fallout. Going forward, prioritizing health spending and targeted support to the most vulnerable households and sectors in the economy remains critical. The authorities are committed to full transparency and reporting of resources deployed for the emergency response, to audit crisis-mitigation spending once the crisis abates, and to publish the results. At the same time, they remain committed to the economic reform program supported by the ongoing ECF arrangement with the IMF. The program aims at using the fiscal space to increase priority spending on education, health and social protection and infrastructure, while mobilizing domestic revenues and maintaining prudent borrowing policies to preserve debt sustainability.  “The IMF’s financial assistance under the RCF will provide a sizable share of the financing needed to implement the anti-crisis measures. Additional concessional and grant financing from the international community will be critical to close the remaining financing gap and help Mauritania respond effectively to the COVID-19 crisis.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 13, "joy": 2, "negative": 8, "disgust": 2, "positive": 21, "surprise": 2, "fear": 6, "trust": 4}, "metadata": ["pandemic", "facility", "economic", "crisis", "economy", "vulnerable", "reporting", "deployed", "ongoing"]}, {"text": "YNW Melly is currently trying to get released early from prison as his attorney claims he is dying from coronavirus -- but the family of his two alleged murder victims wants him to stay behind bars.

Photo Credit: MDA Spokesperson  The Galilee Research Institute (MIGAL) will produce the first vaccine against the COVID-19 novel coronavirus in a few weeks, “if all goes as planned,” Israeli Science and Technology Minister Ofir Akunis announced Thursday at a news conference in northern Israel.  The Galilee-based team of scientists have been working for the past four years on a vaccine to fight IBV, an infectious bronchitis virus that affects poultry. The vaccine has passed its clinical trials at the Veterinary Institute, according to Dr. Chen Katz, biotechnology group leader at MIGAL.   Advertisement  In the trials, the team found that the oral vaccine induced high levels of specific anti-IBV antibodies, Katz said.  By coincidence, the team had chosen a coronavirus as a model for the system to demonstrate proof of concept for the technology. It was “pure luck,” Katz said, and when the team sequenced the DNA of the current COVID-19 novel coronavirus sweeping the planet, they studied it and realized the poultry coronavirus had a high genetic similarity. Both used the same infection mechanism – increasing the likelihood the team could adjust the system to the new sequence and rapidly develop a vaccine to fight the current global epidemic.  Clinical trials at Israel’s Volcani Agricultural Research Institute confirmed the treatment’s viability.  “We are [now] in the middle of this process and hopefully in a few weeks we’ll have the vaccine in our hands,” Katz said.  That’s not the end of the story, however.  “Given the urgent global need for a human coronavirus vaccine, we are doing everything we can to accelerate development,” said MIGAL COO David Zigdon. “The solution we are developing against COVID-19 virus has proven effective, and we believe a version for human treatment can be ready within eight to 10 weeks.”  But the vaccine – which will oral, like original Salk vaccine — must still go through pre-clinical trials, clinical trials and mass production. Zigdon said with everything streamlined, the vaccine could “achieve safety approval in 90 days” after the vaccine is approved for human treatment.  Akunis said he has instructed the director-general at the ministry to expedite the approvals so as to bring the vaccine to market as fast as possible.

Over 4,000 turned out to cast their votes.  So far, 12 Israelis have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Israel has taken far-reaching steps to prevent an outbreak, banning entry to foreigners who were in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea, Japan and Italy in the 14 days prior to arriving, and compelling all Israelis recently in these areas to self-quarantine for 14 days.  The Israelis were, however, allowed out of quarantine Monday in order to vote in the special polling stations. But they were ordered to take special precautions such as putting on face masks before they exit their vehicles and trying to make the trip to the voting station without being accompanied by others who are not in quarantine. They were also prohibited from stopping on the way to and from the voting stations.  Additionally, anyone who showed symptoms of the disease was forbidden from using even the special voting stations. Those hospitalized were granted special voting procedures already in place for patients.  Israel does not allow absentee ballots.  The polling stations, located in the cities of Jerusalem, Safed, Afula Illit, Haifa, Netanya, Tel Aviv, Holon, Beersheba, Ashkelon, Eilat, Rosh Ha’ayin, Modiin, and Kfar Saba, were each made up of two small tents with an adjoining window: in one tent sit Magen David Adom paramedics, specially trained for Monday as polling administrators; in the other, visible through the transparent plastic, the ballot box sat on a table behind a blue screen.  As voters arrived, they were greeted by polling staff wearing full protective gear who asked them to temporarily take off their face masks and checked their identity against their Israeli identity card.

Tedros also revealed he has received death threats in recent months.  \"Please don't politicize this virus,\" Tedros said in a briefing in Geneva, after he was asked about Trump's remarks. He later urged political leaders to \"please quarantine politicizing COVID.\"  \"The focus of all political parties should be to save their people,\" Tedros said. He added that politicizing the virus only exploits differences at the national level.  \"If you want to be exploited and if you want to have many more body bags, then you [politicize the virus],\" the WHO leader said. \"If you don't want many more body bags, then you refrain from politicizing it.\"  The remarks came after Trump sharply criticized the WHO during a White House coronavirus task force briefing Tuesday night and suggested he might put a hold on U.S. funding — the largest single source of money for the health organization.  Tedros did not refer to Trump by name as he stressed the importance of confronting COVID-19 as a common enemy. And he stated several times that he does not mind being targeted by personal attacks. Everyone's focus, he said, should remain on the coronavirus, not political or international rivalries.  \"The unity of your country will be very important to defeat this dangerous virus,\" Tedros said. Without unity, he added, even countries with advanced health care systems \"will be in trouble, and more crisis.\"  COVID-19 has now been blamed for more than 80,000 deaths worldwide and more than 1.4 million people have been confirmed to be infected by the virus, as of Wednesday afternoon, according to a COVID-19 dashboard created by Johns Hopkins University's Whiting School of Engineering, which reports pandemic numbers in near real time.  \"No need to use COVID to score political points,\" Tedros said. \"You have many other ways to prove yourselves.\"  To do so, he added, is \"like playing with fire.\"  \"If we care about our people, if we care about our citizens,\" Tedros said, \"please work across party lines, across ideology, across beliefs, across any differences, for that matter. We need to behave. That's how we can defeat this virus.\"  Asked about how he views criticisms leveled at him and the WHO during the crisis, Tedros said that he had been targeted by racial slurs and death threats and that those threats had emanated from Taiwan.  The WHO director-general added that he doesn't care whether people target him personally. And he said he is proud to be a black man, no matter what racists might say.  As for the death threats, he added: \"I don't give a damn.\"  During the briefing, Tedros also urged governments to unite to fight the pandemic and cited the historic joint effort by the U.S. and the Soviet Union to fight smallpox during the Cold War as an example.  \"The former U.S.S.R. and United States came together and agreed to eradicate smallpox and brought the whole world together with them,\" he said.  At the time of that cooperation in the 1960s, he noted, smallpox was killing 2 million people each year and infecting 15 million annually.  \"The world could not tolerate that kind of disaster,\" Tedros said, urging the U.S. and China to work together to fight the crisis.  The U.S. is the WHO's largest contributor, followed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; the Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; and the United Kingdom, NPR's Laurel Wamsley reports.

Here are some tips from the CDC on how to stay healthy while traveling by plane — and in general — to limit your risk of contracting a cold, the flu or COVID-19. The CDC recommends that travelers should:  Avoid contact with sick people.  Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.  Carry hand sanitizer with you. The CDC recommends at least 60 percent alcohol concentration to maximize effectiveness.  Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.  Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.  Keep the air vents above your seat open during your flight to improve ventilation, ideally pointing them away from your face.  Wipe down arm rests and your tray table with sanitary wipes, and avoid touching the handle on the bathroom doors, if possible, by using a tissue or sanitary wipe.  Bring a face mask and wear it if you’re sitting next to someone coughing or sneezing.  Sit in a window seat and don’t get up until the flight is over, if possible.  If you are seated next to someone sick, ask a flight attendant if it’s possible to move. Passengers sitting within two seats or a row of a passenger with a respiratory illness have an 80 percent higher risk of getting sick.   Advertisement  The CDC’s most important recommendation is to avoid traveling when you are sick. The agency recommends staying home for a minimum of 24 hours after a fever has subsided.  Facing nasty fees to change your flight? The CDC recommends buying travel insurance when you book a ticket, but if it’s already too late, you should call the airline’s customer service and politely explain the situation. Offering a note from your doctor and informing the airline that you are a carrier of airborne illness could potentially land you a one-time waiver to change your flight.  Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, and there are several known strains that can infect people. Most of these strains are known to cause only mild respiratory disease, such as the common cold, but two identified strains — severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) — have caused severe disease. Both of these strains have been ruled out as the cause of the current outbreak.

(CNN/WAVE/WHNT) – An anonymous donor paid for all groceries at four Louisville Kroger locations Monday morning.  The donation happened during the first hour of shopping from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m., the hour dedicated to seniors and the more vulnerable shoppers.  Shoppers said they were thankful, and some were even looking to pay it forward.  “I got free groceries,” Tim French said. “Now I’ve got to find another way to outdo that.”  Sue Hill was also looking to pay it forward during the battle against COVID-19.  “My husband’s a retired police officer,” Hill said. “We know what the families are going through.”  Hill said she did not want to accept the free groceries, but they were already paid for, so she said she is going to help somebody else.  “I’ll probably hit up one or two of the people in the neighborhood that I know need it,” Hill said, “but somebody else will get it. I guarantee it.”  Kroger did not identify the donor.  Groceries were paid for at the UofL campus Kroger on 2nd Street, the Portland Kroger, the 3rd Street location and the store on West Broadway.

In response to the deepening economic crisis, the House passed a nearly $500 billion spending package to help buckled businesses and hospitals.  More than 4.4 million laid-off Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, the government reported. In all, roughly 26 million people — the population of the 10 biggest U.S. cities combined — have now filed for jobless aid in five weeks, an epic collapse that has raised the stakes in the debate over how and when to ease the shutdowns of factories and other businesses.  In the hardest-hit corner of the U.S., evidence emerged that perhaps 2.7 million New York state residents have been infected by the virus — 10 times the number confirmed by lab tests.  A small, preliminary statewide survey of around 3,000 people found that nearly 14% had antibodies showing they had been infected, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. Just in New York City, with a population of 8.6 million, Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot said as many as 1 million may have been infected.  In Washington, many House lawmakers wore face masks and bandannas — and some sat in the otherwise vacant visitors gallery to stay away from others — as they debated the latest spending package. A near-unanimous vote sent it to President Donald Trump in the evening.  Anchoring the bill is the administration’s $250 billion request to replenish a fund to help small- and medium-size businesses with payroll, rent and other expenses. Trump said the bill “will help small businesses to keep millions of workers on the payroll.”  Abroad, there was mixed news about the epidemic. Some countries, including Greece, Bangladesh and Malaysia, announced extensions of their lockdowns. Vietnam, New Zealand and Croatia were among those moving to end or ease such measures.  In Africa, COVID-19 cases surged 43% in the past week to 26,000, according to John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The figures underscored a recent warning from the World Health Organization that the virus could kill more than 300,000 people in Africa and push 30 million into desperate poverty.  Brazil’s health ministry confirmed 407 deaths due to the outbreak in the last 24 hours, a daily high for the country.  Huge lines have formed at food banks from El Paso, Texas, to the Paris suburbs, and food shortages are hitting Africa especially hard.  At a virtual summit, European Union leaders agreed to set up a massive recovery fund to help rebuild the 27-nation bloc’s ravaged economies. While no figure was put on the plan, officials said 1-1.5 trillion euros ($1.1-1.6 trillion) would be needed.  The coronavirus has killed nearly 190,000 people worldwide, including more than 100,000 in Europe and about 47,000 in the United States, according to a tally compiled by John Hopkins University from official government figures. The true numbers are almost certainly far higher.  In the U.S., the economic consequences of the shutdowns have sparked angry rallies in state capitals by protesters demanding that businesses reopen, and Trump has expressed impatience over the restrictions.  Some governors have begun easing up despite warnings from health authorities that it may be too soon to do so without sparking a second wave of infections. In Georgia, gyms, hair salons and bowling alleys can reopen Friday. Texas has reopened its state parks.  Few Americans count on Trump as a reliable source of information on the outbreak, according to a survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. About 23% said they have high levels of trust in what he tells the public, while 21% said they trust him a moderate amount.  On the economic front, few experts foresee a downturn as severe as the Depression, when unemployment remained above 14% from 1931 to 1940, peaking at 25%. But unemployment is considered likely to remain elevated well into next year and probably beyond, and will surely top the 10% peak of the 2008-09 recession.  Janet Simon, laid off as a waitress at an IHOP restaurant in Miami, said she has just $200 in her name and is getting panic attacks because of uncertainty over how she will care for her three children. Simon, 33, filed for unemployment a month ago, and her application is still listed as “pending.”  “I’m doing everything to keep my family safe, my children safe, but everything else around me is falling apart,” Simon said. “But they see it, no matter how much I try to hide my despair.”  Corey Williams, 31, was laid off from his warehouse job in Michigan a month ago and saw his rent, insurance and other bills pile up while he anxiously awaited his unemployment benefits. That finally happened on Wednesday, and he quickly paid $1,700 in bills.  “It was getting pretty tight, pretty tight,” he said. “It was definitely stressful for the last few days.”  While the health crisis has eased in places like Italy, Spain and France, experts say it is far from over, and the threat of new outbreaks looms large.  “The question is not whether there will be a second wave,” said Dr. Hans Kluge, the head of the WHO’s Europe office. “The question is whether we will take into account the biggest lessons so far.”  German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized some German states for moving too briskly in trying to reopen their economies. Germany has been praised for its approach to the pandemic and has a much lower reported death toll than other large European countries.  “We’re not living in the final phase of the pandemic, but still at the beginning,” Merkel warned. “It would be a shame if premature hope ultimately punishes us all.”  Governments are bearing that risk in mind with the onset of Ramadan, the holy month of daytime fasting, overnight festivities and communal prayer that begins for the world’s 1.8 billion Muslims with this week’s new moon. Many Muslim leaders have closed mosques or banned collective evening prayer to ward off infections.  The virus has already disrupted Christianity’s Holy Week, Passover, the Muslim hajj pilgrimage and other major religious events.  Authorities in the capital of Indonesia, the most populous Muslim-majority nation, extended restrictions to cover all of Ramadan. Turkey banned communal eating during the holiday.  Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan bowed to the country’s clerics, refusing to close mosques despite doctors’ warnings that such gatherings could further spread the virus in a country with a fragile health care system.   ___  Garcia Cano reported from Washington, and Charlton from Paris.

The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Westminister is ready to vote on closing Parliament tonight as emergency legislation on a bill with powers to battle coronavirus is very likely to get royal assent. Parliament is due to have a recess for Easter but the COVID-19 pandemic could spark a much longer closure. It comes as Westminister was named as one of the hotspots for the spread of coronavirus as many MPs have self-isolated.  Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Kuenssberg said: \"Parliament has been moving at breakneck speed through this legislation trying to ramp through all these emergency laws. \"It's basically a full set of extra powers for ministers to deal with the crisis as and when they need them. \"Many of them, the more controversial ones, ministers hope they might never need to pull the trigger on. \"But they are powers that the Government and Whitehall have concluded that they might need because of the needs of this crisis and how fast everything is moving.

It had already closed to visitors and reduced the number of lawmakers allowed in the House of Commons chamber to allow them to sit more spaced out in accordance with guidance on social distancing. House of Commons speaker Lindsay Hoyle also said on Monday that any votes which took place would be adapted to avoid the usual process which can see hundreds of lawmakers crammed into a narrow room together as they are counted through.

Later, at the Paris nursing home where the mother has been agonizing in the solitude of her room, feeling imprisoned and miserable without the sun on her cheeks, the breeze in her hair or her daughter's tender hugs, they listened to the French songbird together.  'When he takes me in his arms,' Piaf wailed.  With mother and daughter forced to sit 1 meter (3 feet) apart, unable to hug or hold each other during their half-hour visit in the home's fenced-off small garden, the words rang like a cruel joke.  When might Sabrina get to take Patricia, her mother, in her arms again? No one can say for sure. Likely no time soon.  Even before many businesses rumble back to life or schoolyards bustle again, France started to allow tightly regulated nursing home visits this week, puncturing a strict no-visitors lockdown that still failed to prevent an ongoing tidal wave of coronavirus deaths among elderly nursing home residents.

Sabrina and Patricia were on the phone to each other minutes after they said goodbye with blown air kisses and the mother trundled back alone to her room in her motorized wheelchair, giving a final wave.  \"Stopping us from seeing our children is a crime,' she said. 'They wait for us to die before sending our children to us.'  The visit, she said, 'makes me want to live again.'  But the next cannot come soon enough.  'We are in prison,\" Patricia said.  As the virus raced through Europe, the hardest-hit countries \" Italy, Spain, Britain, France \" banned nursing home visits to protect the elderly, who are particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus. From Belgium to Turkey, several other countries did the same.  While the virus causes mild to moderate symptoms for many, it can trigger much more severe illness in older people and those with health problems. Nursing homes have been hard hit around the world. In France, more than one-third of the over 21,300 deaths reported have occurred in care homes.  The emotional toll of cutting off the homes has been immense and largely untold because the suffering has been taking place behind sealed-shut nursing home doors. For residents' families, the only news some have had from the inside has been in dribs and drabs, in written updates from care home directors.  Now that visits are being allowed again, a fuller picture of the agony is starting to emerge.  French President Emmanuel Macron has taken notice. He led the push in March to seal off homes before the rest of the country, pleading publicly for people to stop visiting their elderly relatives before he ordered France into a nationwide lockdown from March 17.  This week, Macron retweeted a painful-to-watch interview with a 96-year-old nursing home resident, Jeanne Pault, complaining tearfully about being stuck in her room, deprived of the daily visits she used to get from her husband and family.  'I'm locked in here all day. It's not a life,\" she said. 'My neighbor hasn't got the virus. Neither have I. We could see each other from time to time, chat a little.'  In his tweet, Macron wrote: 'Madame, your pain overwhelms us all. For you, for all of our elders in retirement homes or establishments, visits by loved ones are now allowed. Always with one priority: to protect you.'  But among families, fury is mounting with the death toll. Some are filing legal complaints accusing care homes of neglect and endangering lives.  Sabrina is among those who believes that nursing homes were sealed off not to protect residents but to prevent families from knowing what was happening inside.  'It sickens me,' she said. 'Those are our parents behind those walls, my mother, our fathers. They have no right to deprive us of them like that.'  She worries that Patricia, a retired hairdresser who has suffered a stroke, will be even more diminished physically by weeks of being confined to her room.  'I'm going to fight,' she promised her mother in the phone call after their meeting. 'Put bluntly, you have just two choices: either die from COVID or end up like vegetables.'   ___  Associated Press journalist Jean-François Badias contributed from Kaysersberg, France.   ___  Follow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 15, "positive": 20, "negative": 7, "sadness": 1, "disgust": 1, "joy": 4, "anger": 12, "fear": 8}, "metadata": ["nursing", "french", "france", "strict", "lockdown", "ongoing", "coronavirus", "deaths", "elderly", "children", "virus", "vulnerable", "mild", "symptoms", "toll", "updates", "nationwide", "families", "covid", "ap", "outbreak"]}, {"text": " Hide Transcript Show Transcript  DECREASE AS YOU CAN SEE TRENDING LATELY. >> WELL, JUST ABOUT 30 MINUTES AGO, PRISMA HEALTH UPDATED THE OUTPATIENT VISITOR POLICY.

OKLAHOMA CITY (KFOR) – As Americans begin to receive their stimulus checks amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Internal Revenue Service says the public should be on the lookout for scams.  For most Americans, the one-time payment will be a direct deposit into your bank account. For those without a bank, elderly or other groups who have traditionally received tax refunds via paper check, they will receive their check in this same manner.  The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the IRS say criminals are aware of these payments and will be attempting to steal the funds.  Unsolicited phone calls, emails, text messages, or other communications pretending to be from the IRS are likely a scam.  “We will work with IRS-CI to vigorously pursue anyone who tries to cheat or scam Oklahomans out of their much-needed stimulus money,” said U.S. Attorney Downing. “Any fraudster who is thinking about engaging in related criminal conduct should think again. We will hold them accountable to the fullest extent possible.”  Related Content Treasury says 80 million people will get stimulus payments this week  The IRS says the following tips can help you spot a scam and report fraudulent activities:  The IRS will NOT call and ask you to verify your payment details. Do NOT give your bank account, debit account, or PayPal account information to anyone—even if someone claims it’s necessary to get your check. It’s a scam.  If you receive a call, do NOT engage with scammers, even if you want to tell them that you know it’s a scam. Just hang up.  If you receive texts or emails claiming that you can get your money faster by sending personal identifying information or clicking on links, delete these texts and emails. Do NOT click on any links in those texts or emails.  If you receive a “check” for an odd amount (especially one with cents), or a check that requires you to verify the check online or by calling a number, it’s a scam.  Special Agent in Charge Cantu warns the public, “As the agency responsible for issuing economic impact payments, the IRS unfortunately expects some bad actors to execute fraud schemes in an attempt to take advantage of the situation,” said IRS-CI Special Agent in Charge Tamera Cantu of the Dallas Field Office. “Be aware that contact from non-IRS sources could be scams and do not become a victim. Every taxpayer needs to exercise caution when choosing a return preparer or tax professional to ensure their personal and other privileged information is safeguarded.”  Remember, scammers change tactics. Callers can be aggressive and threatening. Do not be bullied into disclosing personal information or in making any payment.

In an opinion piece that was published in the Wall Street Journal on Friday, the former Secretary of State urged Trump to launch a grand project, like the Marshall Plan, to unify the allies and convince them that the Uncle Sam can still rally the troops in a time of crisis. Here’s Kissinger:  “Drawing lessons from the development of the Marshall Plan and the Manhattan Project, the U.S. is obliged to undertake a major effort in three domains. First, shore up global resilience to infectious disease…Second, strive to heal the wounds to the world economy….Third, safeguard the principles of the liberal world order. While the assault on human health will—hopefully—be temporary, the political and economic upheaval it has unleashed could last for generations. No country, not even the U.S., can in a purely national effort overcome the virus. Addressing the necessities of the moment must ultimately be coupled with a global collaborative vision and program. If we cannot do both in tandem, we will face the worst of each.” (“The Coronavirus Pandemic Will Forever Alter the World Order”, Wall Street Journal)  Kissinger thinks Trump’s “America First” rhetoric has undermined foreign relations and weakened US hegemony. He thinks the administration’s isolationist policies have created a leadership vacuum that China has quickly filled. And he has a point, too, after all, while China sent medical teams and vital supplies to countries hard-hit by the virus, the United States was busy tightening sanctions on Iran, Cuba and Venezuela, which prevented infected civilians from getting the medications they need to survive.  Here is a great discussion of Kissinger’s article by the FTN Podcast team (not included in original source article). Transcript available on RI here: Is Globalism in Big Trouble? Henry Kissinger Sounds the Alarm (FTN Podcast, Audio + Transcript)  Naturally, China’s humanitarian contributions have been widely applauded while Washington’s conduct has been denounced as petty, vicious and vindictive. There’s no doubt that the Trump administration has ceded the moral high-ground to its arch-enemy, China. Here’s Kissinger again:  “Now, in a divided country, efficient and farsighted government is necessary to overcome obstacles unprecedented in magnitude and global scope. Sustaining the public trust is crucial to social solidarity, to the relation of societies with each other, and to international peace and stability.” WSJ  Of course, when Kissinger talks about “public trust” and “social solidarity” what he really means is that the government needs to settle on an effective public relations strategy that will dupe the sheeple into falling in line. In Kissinger’s lexicon, solidarity is narrowly defined as ‘public support for elitist projects’ like globalization, open borders and the free movement of capital. These are the principles that guide Kissinger’s recommendations not any affection for working people who he regards as stupid mules. Here’s more:  “Nations cohere and flourish on the belief that their institutions can foresee calamity, arrest its impact and restore stability. When the Covid-19 pandemic is over, many countries’ institutions will be perceived as having failed. Whether this judgment is objectively fair is irrelevant. The reality is the world will never be the same after the coronavirus. To argue now about the past only makes it harder to do what has to be done.” WSJ  See? What really Kissinger really cares about is the post-coronavirus world order, which he believes will mark the beginning of an entirely new era, an era in which governments will have to respond to unexpected crises, bitter political polarization and the growing prospect of social unrest. Kissinger seems to grasp all of this, but instead of offering a new vision for the future, he clings to the battered remains of a failed system that has exacerbated the wealth gap, triggered one economy-crushing financial meltdown after the other, and widened the arc of instability from North Africa, through the Middle East and into Central Asia. This is the world order that Kissinger wants to preserve, an America-centric imperium ruled by establishment elites, brandy-drooling plutocrats and the Bank Mafia. Is it any wonder why the proles are demanding change? Here’s more:  “The world’s democracies need to defend and sustain their Enlightenment values. A global retreat from balancing power with legitimacy will cause the social contract to disintegrate both domestically and internationally.” WSJ  “Enlightenment values”?? Is that what we saw in the photos from Abu Ghraib, or the footage from decimated Falluja, or the countless reports of black-sites where kidnapped victims were taken by US Intel Agents and beaten into submission? Do they practice enlightenment values at Gitmo, or at Bagram Air base or in Mosul which was reduced to rubble by heavy artillery and US bombers? Kissinger can blabber about enlightenment values all he wants, but he knows from first hand experience that those values are precariously propped atop a mountain of bloody corpses all sacrificed in the name of the liberal world order.

The survey, conducted by Sermo, a global health care polling company, asked 6,227 physicians in 30 countries to find out what is the most effective against SARS-CoV-2. The poll finds that 37% of those treating patients suffering from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 rated hydroxychloroquine as the “most effective therapy” out of a list of 15 choices.  On Monday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave chloroquine and its derivative, hydroxychloroquine, emergency-use authorization, although many physicians were already using the drug.  Azithromycin, known by the brand name Zithromax or Z-Pak, came in as the second-most effective therapy at 32%, followed by “nothing.”  Hydroxychloroquine, which is sold under the brand name Plaquenil, was prescribed mainly in the United States for the most severe cases. “Outside the U.S., hydroxychloroquine was equally used for diagnosed patients with mild to severe symptoms whereas in the U.S. it was most commonly used for high risk diagnosed patients,” the survey found.  Sermo released a statement on the poll with other findings, including:  The three most commonly prescribed treatments amongst COVID-19 treaters are 56% analgesics, 41% Azithromycin, and 33% Hydroxychloroquine  Hydroxychloroquine usage amongst COVID-19 treaters is 72% in Spain, 49% in Italy, 41% in Brazil, 39% in Mexico, 28% in France, 23% in the U.S., 17% in Germany, 16% in Canada, 13% in the UK and 7% in Japan  Hydroxychloroquine was overall chosen as the most effective therapy amongst COVID-19 treaters from a list of 15 options (37% of COVID-19 treaters)  75% in Spain, 53% Italy, 44% in China, 43% in Brazil, 29% in France, 23% in the U.S. and 13% in the U.K.  The two most common treatment regimens for Hydroxychloroquine were:  (38%) 400mg twice daily on day one; 400 mg daily for five days  (26%) 400mg twice daily on day one; 200mg twice daily for four days  Globally, 19% of physicians prescribed or have seen Hydroxychloroquine prophylactically used for high risk patients, and 8% for low risk patients, Sermo said.  President Donald Trump has been a big booster of the anti-malarial drugs, expressing optimism about the drugs that he said could be “one of the biggest game changers” in medicine.  “HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE & AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “The FDA has moved mountains – Thank You!”  In his tweet, Trump was referring to a French study that the drug combo can be effective in counteracting the coronavirus COVID-19, which has spread across the world after emerging in China.  “Despite its small sample size, our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin,” the study found.  “French confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting,” the researchers wrote in an abstract, Fox News reported. “Depending on their clinical presentation, azithromycin was added to the treatment.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 10, "positive": 17, "negative": 1, "disgust": 1, "joy": 1, "surprise": 4, "fear": 1, "trust": 3}, "metadata": ["hydroxychloroquine", "deemed", "global", "treating", "coronavirus", "chloroquine", "united", "diagnosed", "mild", "symptoms", "treatments", "uk", "options", "donald", "trump", "fda", "french", "significantly", "viral", "hospital", "researchers", "fox"]}, {"text": "The Pentagon announced this month nearly all PCS and temporary duty moves would halt for the next 60 days in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. But some are worried this could strain military families financially.  That’s why Pay it Forward Inc., a group that was established in 2016 to provide resources to military service members and veterans, is urging military families and others to get in touch with their lawmakers to require the Pentagon to provide service members relief funds. The group has crafted a draft letter that could be sent out.  “These families left in ‘limbo’ with the 60 day suspension are facing unprecedented financial hardship,” the letter says.  “A fund must be created to support military families who have suddenly found themselves in financial peril due to the current circumstances,” the letter says. “This requires urgent action.”  Specifically, the group argues military families are in jeopardy of paying double for housing at both duty stations, losing out on thousands of dollars for rental deposits, and losing income if a military spouse has already left a job at the current duty station and won’t be able to start their jobs at the next duty station on time.  “We understand that the suspension is necessary to ‘flatten the curve’ and the health and well-being of our service members is always our top priority, but we want to implore the DOD to provide relief funds for these families who are now facing financial devastation as a result of these changes,” the letter says.  On Thursday, the Army announced that those impacted by the suspension can qualify for hardship pay before the PCS move is completed. Under the policy, Army families are allocated up to $1,500 a month to offset their expenses while they wait to PCS.  × Fear of missing out?

Gen. Thomas C. Seamands, the Army’s deputy chief of staff G-1.  Although Pay it Forward Inc. said this action was a start, the group posted on Facebook that it “barely makes a dent in making our military families financially whole.”  The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Military Times.  The Pentagon’s decision to stall PCS and temporary duty moves was included in an order to bar all travel for all DoD military and civilian personnel and their families from traveling to and from countries designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a “Warning Level 3.”  “This includes all forms of official travel, including permanent change of station, temporary duty and government-funded leave,” the Pentagon announcement said.  Countries included on the list include South Korea, Italy, and Germany — all countries with U.S. military installations.  And on March 14, the Pentagon approved another measure to prohibit all domestic travel among service members and their families, including travel relocating to another duty station.  Many families are already in the process of PCS’ing though — meaning many military families could be without their household goods as they get shipped off to the next duty station.  “If a service member has shipped their household goods, they should work with their chain of command to determine the status of their current orders and contact the local personal property to see what is possible, depending on the status of their shipment,” Dave Dunn, spokesman for U.S. Transportation Command, said last week.

Underscoring the \"massive and urgent support\" needed for developing countries, he echoed his call for a worldwide relief package of at least 10 per cent of the global economy's output.  He acknowledged steps taken by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) � $12.3 billion in emergency financing; the World Bank, with $160 billion of extra financing; and the G20 leading economies, which have agreed to suspend debt service payments for the poorest countries, but added, \"even this is not enough\".  Guterres maintained that a smart recovery from COVID-19 would help steer the world onto a \"safer, healthier, more sustainable and inclusive path\", but that it was \"critical to address the fragilities\".  The Secretary-General called on Governments to ensure that revitalized spending \"accelerate the decarbonization of all aspects of our economy and privilege the creation of green jobs\".  He also stressed that taxpayers' money not be used to subsidize fossil fuels or bail out carbon-intensive industries; a price should be placed on carbon; and public funds be invested in a future where financial institutions and investors take climate risks fully into account.  \"Our template remains the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Paris Agreement on climate change\", the UN chief said.  Guterres also recalled his global ceasefire appeal in March to face together the common enemy of COVID-19.  \"The cease-fire call has resonated widely\", he told journalists, however, as mistrust is challenging implementation, his envoys are \"working tirelessly�to turn expressed intentions into effective cease-fires\".  The Idlib cease-fire is holding in Syria, \"but we are still hopeful for a country-wide end to hostilities\", he said, adding that the UN is pushing in Afghanistan for a humanitarian ceasefire between the Government and Taliban fighters.  And although fighting in Libya has escalated, declarations made yesterday present \"a glimpse of hope that a cessation of hostilities remains possible\".  \"I believe there is an opportunity for peace in Yemen\", upheld Guterres, citing that all parties supported his appeal. Saudi Arabia has declared a temporary unilateral cease-fire, with the UN engaging with all actors to make it permanent, to restart the political process towards lasting peace.  Pointing out that the first two COVID-19 deaths were registered there on Wednesday, he said, \"it is time to recognize that the Yemeni people have suffered too much\".  \"All our efforts depend on strong political backing\", stressed the UN chief, sharing his hope the Security Council would be able to \"find unity and adopt decisions that can help to make ceasefires meaningful and real\".

LIVE, DAN GRIFFIN, WLWT NE  Advertisement Christ Hospital furloughs a number of staff members during COVID-19 pandemic Share Shares Copy Link Copy  The Christ Hospital announced Wednesday that a number staff members who are not directly working on the front lines during the COVID-19 pandemic will be furloughed.According to officials with The Christ Hospital, staff members who are non-patient-facing employees will be temporarily furloughed for 60 days beginning in May. Employees who are furloughed are still able to have access to their full medical and health benefits and are also able to apply for unemployment.The Christ Hospital, among many other health networks in the state, followed Gov. Mike DeWine's order in March to stop elective procedures. Hospital officials noted that as the pandemic continues, they have seen \"significant declines in patient volumes and associated financial loss,\" which has led them to the decision to furlough non-patient-facing employees.The Christ Hospital implemented many efforts to combat financial loss, including making temporary staffing changes and examining cost control efforts, but noted the efforts were insufficient in filling in the financial gap.Executive leaders at the hospital have also taken a 25% reduction of pay during the pandemic.Doctors and nurses working directly on the frontlines who are providing patient care during the coronavirus pandemic will not be impacted by furloughs or cuts, according to a statement from The Christ Hospital.\"We realize the consequences of this pandemic and that the resulting actions impact our employees and their families in significant ways,\" said Arturo Polizzi, president and CEO of The Christ Hospital Health Network. \"We remain, as always, fully committed to our employees. We have a range of employee support programs, including a new COVID-19 employee emergency fund that is available to employees experiencing hardships. In addition, we are actively partnering with the governor's office to prepare for a gradual reopening of procedures and services in May. Our goal is to get our teams back to work as quickly and safely as possible.\"  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 12, "positive": 23, "negative": 3, "disgust": 1, "joy": 1, "anger": 2, "fear": 17, "trust": 4}, "metadata": ["recovered", "symptoms", "donate", "hospital", "antibodies", "protocols", "dan", "pandemic", "elective", "implemented", "coronavirus", "impacted", "families", "ceo", "experiencing", "reopening"]}, {"text": " As Prepared for Delivery  Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us here today.  This HHS briefing on the China coronavirus aims to do two things: provide the American public with an update on the risks presented by the virus, and provide the latest on the actions that President Trump's administration is taking to respond to the outbreak and keep Americans safe.  I am joined by Dr. Anne Schuchat, Principal Deputy Director of CDC; Dr. Tony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; Dr. Robert Kadlec, HHS's Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response; and Dr. Stephen Hahn, Commissioner of Food and Drugs.  As of this morning, we still have only 14 cases of the China coronavirus detected in the United States, involving travel to China or close contacts with travelers; 3 cases among Americans repatriated from Wuhan; and 40 cases among American passengers repatriated from the Diamond Princess.  I want to thank the responders and communities that have worked with HHS and the administration to provide these Americans with the treatment they need. I'm also grateful to the governors and other state and local leaders who have worked with us in close partnership so far.  The immediate risk to the general American public remains low. But, as we have warned, that has the potential to change quickly. There is now community transmission in a number of countries, including outside of Asia.  That is deeply concerning, and community spread in other countries will make successful containment at our borders harder and harder. That is why we have already been working closely with state, local, and private sector partners to prepare for mitigating the virus's potential spread in the United States, because we will likely see more cases here.  Dr. Schuchat will provide some more details on what that will look like, including how we would treat potential cases that arise from community transmission here in the U.S.  This preparation has been possible in part because of how aggressively President Trump has responded to this outbreak. As soon as we knew of the threat presented by the novel virus, public health leaders were monitoring it and beginning to prepare.  The travel restrictions that the President put in place at around the beginning of this month have given our country valuable time to prepare, and that is precisely what they were designed to do.  That includes working with Congress. Yesterday, the White House sent a request to Congress to make at least $2.5 billion in funding available for preparedness and response.  There are five major priorities within the supplemental, which I underscored this morning before the Senate appropriations committee.  First, we need to expand our surveillance work, building on an existing system we have within CDC's influenza surveillance network.  Second, we will need funds to support public health preparedness and response for state and local governments for what could be a very large-scale response. This support complements the significant funds that these partners have received from CDC for preparedness—about two-thirds of a billion dollars a year in recent years.  Third and fourth, we need to support development of therapeutics and fourth, we need to support development of vaccines.  Given the scale of this outbreak, the private sector sees a real market for both kinds of countermeasures, as well as for diagnostics, but federal funding and guidance can help accelerate this work. Dr. Fauci will address the current status of that work in more depth.  Fifth and finally, we need funds for the purchase of personal protective equipment for the Strategic National Stockpile, a topic that Dr. Kadlec can address.  I'll conclude by noting that, though scheduling conflicts prevented this briefing from including other members of the President's Coronavirus Task Force, we will be providing a new update from interagency leaders soon, and we expect to continue doing so regularly.  Earlier this afternoon on CNBC, NEC Director Larry Kudlow offered an update on how we see this outbreak affecting the economy.  This morning, Dr. Messonnier from CDC provided the usual telebriefing.  As Dr. Schuchat will emphasize in just a moment, the Trump Administration will continue to be aggressively transparent as the outbreak and our response evolve. We will continue keeping the American people and the media apprised of the situation and what everyone can do to prepare.  In the meantime, I will continue to work closely with President Trump and the President's task force on our preparations to keep Americans safe.  With that, I will hand things over to Dr. Schuchat for an update from CDC. Dr. Schuchat?

Those lies included that (1) the virus could not be transmitted between humans; (2) the outbreak had been contained to the City of Wuhan; (3) the virus was, in any event, not the product of a Wuhan “wet market” but instead had been deployed by U.S. military forces in that city, and (4) a travel ban on Chinese air travelers would be ineffective.  All four of those statements were lies. Recall that a “lie” is a statement known by the speaker of the lie to be false with the intent that the recipient of the lie accept it as true and rely upon it as true. Thus, a mere careless or negligent misstatement of a fact, while false, is not a true “lie.” Stated otherwise, China lied…, people died.  The Leftist/Democrat sycophant media in this country picked up on the lies and launched a 24/7 attack on President Trump because he had the nerve to doubt the lies and, in particular, because he purportedly “overreacted” with the slander that he was a “xenophobe” when early in the game – January 31, 2020, to be exact – he barred the entry into the United States of foreign travelers from China. Even the “vaunted” (more on that adjective later) Dr. Anthony Fauci from the White House pandemic task force characterized that one action as going a long way toward fighting the spread of the virus in this country.  However, not only did China lie and not only did the media hyenas enthusiastically repeat the lies, the same were ratified and perpetuated by that watchdog over global health matters, the World Health Organization… the “WHO.” This organization, of course, is not to be confused with “Dr. Who,” a time-traveling alien intent on saving civilizations and helping people in need. Today’s WHO is becoming the antithesis of Dr. Who.  The current “Director General” of the Geneva-based United Nations-spawned organization is one Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, an Ethiopian microbiologist and internationally-recognized malaria researcher. Remember that malaria connection, as it will come in handy later.  Throughout this ordeal, Ghebreyesus has been a puppet defender of China and the lies it has spread – as well as the truthful facts it has suppressed – all to the patent detriment of the world. When President Trump suggested that the United States was considering suspending the annual multi-millions of dollars in donations it makes to the WHO because of its conspiratorial actions with its partner in crime, China, Ghebreyesus had the gall to admonish President Trump to “please don’t politicize this virus.”  Really? Pointing out that Ghebreyesus and the WHO are the enablers for China’s continued lies and spread of the pandemic is political? Since when has the exposure of deadly, toxic deceit morphed into a “political” attack? Oh, wait…, right…, when China and the American mainstream media deem it so.  Ghebreyesus goes on in his YouTube soliloquy to suggest that President Trump is “exploiting” the situation and that, as a result, “there will be many more body bags.” Memo to Ghebreyesus: how many fewer body bags would have been needed had you not lied and covered-up for China? He adds that “[w]e don’t do politics in WHO, we don’t … but I assure you, we would do everything right in WHO. We would do everything that we can to serve humanity.” That too, is a lie. What he means is that WHO (under his “leadership”) will do that which China will either (a) direct him to do, or (b) allow him to do. Ghebreyesus is, to use a polite, clinical term, a jerk. Pretty much all you need to know about the incestuous relationship between and among AdhanomGhebreyesus, the WHO and China is chronicled here.  Oh, and don’t forget that Dr. Anthony (“papers, please?” Fauci on the White House virus task force, when asked at the March 25, 2020 virus briefing press conference for his opinion on Ghebreyesus, responded:  “So, Tedros is really an outstanding person. I’ve known him from the time that he was the Minister of Health of Ethiopia. I mean, obviously, over the years, anyone who says that the WHO has not had problems has not been watching the WHO. But I think, under his leadership, they’ve done very well. He has been all over this. I was on the phone with him a few hours ago leading a WHO call.”  Tedros? Cozy first-name buddies, huh, Dr. Fauci? Recall as well that Ghebreyesus, as a malaria research expert, knows about hydroxychloroquine. Faithful P&E readers also know about it and the dramatic – even lifesaving – benefits it has thus far confirmed in the fight against the virus while a vaccine gets developed.  So what is the position of the WHO and Ghebreyesus regarding hydroxychloroquine? Glad you asked: https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/RD-Blueprint-expert-group-on-CQ-call-Mar-13-2020.pdf?ua=1. At p. 4 of the WHO “R&D Blueprint for fighting the Wuhan/COVID-19 virus,” we find this:  “A recent in vitro study shows hydroxychloroquine to have greater antiviral activity against SARS CoV-2 in Vero cell lines than chloroquine. However, another recently published RCT study in China with hydroxychloroquine involving 30 COVID 19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms shows no significant reduction in time to clinical improvement or viral clearance in the hydroxychloroquine arm compared to the conventional therapy control group.” (Emphasis added)  So, against the “on the ground, real-time, rubber meets the road” results documented by U.S. doctors who have successfully administered hydroxychloroquine to hundreds of their patients – and, in the process, put them on the path to recovery – the WHO offers up a research study on 30 Chinese patients in China where the drug showed – purportedly, so they say… wink… wink… – “no significant reduction in time to clinical improvement.” Amazing. The pogrom against the use of the drug in this fight thus appears to be firmly entrenched in the minds of the Chinese, the WHO, Ghebreyesus, Fauci and America’s propaganda jackals at CNN, MSNBC, NBC, CBS, the Gray Trollop and the WaPo.  Not only is the statement by “Tedros” that the WHO is doing everything possible to “serve humanity” false, it is dangerously false. While China, the WHO, Ghebreyesus and Fauci may not be fans of hydroxychloroquine, the people who have thus far seen swift, sometimes immediate “clinical improvement” are. So when Fauci says of Ghebreyesus that “he has been all over this,” by the term “all over,” he probably means that “Tedros” was “finished” with considering the drug as an effective interim palliative rather than that he was “concentrating on examining its utility.”  With “friends” like “Tedros” at the WHO – ahem, claimed by Fauci as “a really outstanding person” – President Trump does not need more enemies.

After recording over 17,000 deaths in hospitals alone – many more occurred in homes and care homes – the UK is one of the worst affected countries in Europe, with over 1.2 lakh cases, leaving it struggling to put in place the infrastructure and staff needed.  Hawking’s family donated his ventilator to the Royal Papworth Hospital in Cambridge, which was home to the renowned theoretical physicist who passed away in 2018 after making field defining contributions to his subject.  Hawking’s daughter Lucy said: “Our father received brilliant, dedicated and compassionate medical care from both Royal Papworth and Addenbrooke’s hospitals in Cambridge. As a ventilated patient, Royal Papworth was incredibly important to my father and helped him through some very difficult times”.  “We realised that it would be at the forefront of the Covid-19 epidemic and got in touch with some of our old friends there to ask if we could help,” she added.  The 330 Chinese graduates of UK universities made personal donations of £38,000 to buy two ventilators for the National Health Service. The vital equipment was transported on a flight from Shanghai to London.  The former students were part of the government’s Chevening programme which enables future global leaders to study in the UK. Minister of state for Asia Nigel Adams thanked them for the gesture.  In an open letter, the alumni said from China: “We wish to show our support and care by standing with British people in fighting with the pandemic. We have good faith and wish a full and swift success in our joint effort”.

'Any place, I don’t care': Khabib desperate to make Ferguson fight happen despite coronavirus chaos  That included this weekend’s UFC London – which was due to be headlined by local hero Leon Edwards and American former welterweight king Tyron Woodley.  Once it emerged that the event in the UK capital could not happen and that Edwards was ruled out, Colby issued his own social media plea to step in and face Woodley at an alternative location.  \"The people want this fight... let's save America, b*tch,\" Covington implored on Instagram, flanked by a bikini-clad friend.  Ultimately that didn't happen as the event was scrapped completely, although Covington now says both men had been down to fight.  “Both sides were agreeing,” Covington told MMA Fighting.  “Tyron Woodley’s never accepted a fight with me. For the first time ever, he’s finally agreed to fight me, and it was about to happen for the people, and all of a sudden, the plug got pulled, and they couldn’t find anywhere to do the fight.”  The American Top Team fighter suggested the cancelation was the wrong decision – despite social curbs being imposed in the US and around the world to halt the spread of a virus that has infected more than 200,000 people and caused over 8,000 deaths.  “I don’t think it was the right move,” Covington said. “I think we’re healthy, young professional athletes. We already do something that’s dangerous enough as it is, getting locked into an octagon and fighting each other, so what’s more dangerous than a little flu that’s going on right now?  “I think people just need to be more aware of what’s going on, wash their hands, social distancing, this and that. But as professional athletes, we already risk enough as it is.”  Also on rt.com 'I will tie one hand behind my back': Colby Covington offers 50 Cent $1m fight and claims he is 'Donald Trump's favorite fighter'  The Trump-supporting Covington also said mass hysteria was playing a role in the situation.  “I think everybody’s kind of panicking and acting irrationally, and we just need to realize that everything’s under control, and America, the greatest country in the world, is going to be OK, and things will go back to normal…,\" the former welterweight interim champ said.  “So I want to see us come together as one and understand this isn’t left our right.

But hospital admissions for Covid-19 continued to rise for another four weeks. At the epidemic’s peak, nearly 20,000 patients were hospitalized, more than 10,000 in severe or critical condition.  There are lessons here for the U.S. A rapidly escalating outbreak in a large American city would severely burden an area’s health system. Americans are doing things to try to avert this outcome: working from home, cutting down on social interactions. That will slow down chains of spread. But if two more large cities suffer rapid epidemic spread at the same time, the health system will be overwhelmed. There are steps American hospitals and policy makers can take now to increase capacity to deal with a crisis.  In Italy and China, death rates spiked when health-care systems became exhausted. Trying to keep the peak number of infections below that point of saturation is the top priority. The federal government needs to double down on communicating the risks and telling Americans to stay home and limit social gatherings. The power to limit the spread of this epidemic ultimately rests with every individual.  But the government also needs to help hospitals expand their capacity. New York state has about 57,000 hospital beds, 3,200 of them in intensive-care units. An outbreak in New York City proportionate to Wuhan’s epidemic could exhaust the entire state’s capacity.  America has some 900,000 hospital beds, but about 70% of them are occupied at any given time. Critical-care beds are even scarcer. The U.S. has about 64,000 medical ICU beds, with another 50,000 designated for surgical or neurological patients. Repurposing surgical and neurological ICU beds is difficult because most are occupied with patients who are very ill. Patients admitted to ICU beds are in critical condition and require that high level of care.

As the nation with the world's highest number of COVID-19 deaths, Italy is looking to its super-old survivors for inspiration.\"I'm well, I'm well,\" Zanusso said Tuesday during a video call with The Associated Press from the Maria Grazia Residence for the elderly in Lessona, a town in the northern region of Piedmont. \"I watch TV, read the newspapers.\"Zanusso wore a protective mask, as did her family doctor of 35 years beside her, Carla Furno Marchese, who also donned eyewear and a gown that covered her head.Asked about her illness, Zanusso is modest: \"I had some fever.\"Her doctor said Zanusso was in bed for a week.\"We hydrated her because she wasn't eating, and then we thought she wasn't going to make it because she was always drowsy and not reacting,\" Furno Marchese said.\"One day she opened her eyes again and resumed doing what she used to before,\" Furno Marchese said. The doctor recalled when Zanusso was able to sit up, then managed to get out of bed.What helped her get through the illness? \"Courage and strength, faith,\" Zanusso said. It worked for her, so she advises others who fall ill to also \"give yourself courage, have faith.\"COVID-19 can cause mild or moderate symptoms, and most of those who are infected recover. But the elderly and those with existing health problems can be at high risk for more serious illness.The virus has killed nearly 18,000 people in Italy and over 88,000 worldwide. The World Health Organization says 95% of those who have died in Europe were over 60 years old.Under Italy's five-week-long lockdown, which is aimed at containing the spread of infections that have overwhelmed hospitals, visitors aren't allowed at homes for the elderly.Her doctor asked Zanusso what she would like to do when \"they open the doors.\"\"I'd like to take a lovely walk,\" she replied. And your three great-grandchildren? \"Watch them play together.\"Deaths, hospitalizations and new infections are leveling off in Italy, and Premier Giuseppe Conte is expected to announce in the coming days how long the lockdown will remain in place, with expectations that some restrictions could be eased.For now, Zanusso is isolated from other residents as she awaits a follow-up swab test to confirm she is negative for the virus.She grew up in Treviso, in the northeastern Veneto region, where she worked for many years in the textile industry. Zanusso, who turns 104 on Aug. 16, had four children - three of whom are living - and has four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.\"She's old, but healthy, with no chronic illness,'' her doctor said.This week, Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera devoted an entire page to the stories of super-old survivors, called \"healing at 100 years old.\" The inspirational portraits are a counterpoint to news of large numbers of deaths among elderly people living in Italian nursing homes and other assisted-living facilities.Of the victims, most elderly weren't tested for COVID-19 if they died in nursing homes, so the numbers don't figure into Italy's overall coronavirus death toll, which is the highest in the world.Medical staff \"went through a very hard time,'' said Furno Marchese, the doctor. \"It was a great emergency with so many residents ill, so to see a positive outcome was very rewarding, not only for me, but for all the people who worked hard here nonstop.\"Outside the nonprofit, 61-bed Maria Grazia Residence, the Italian flag flies at half-staff in tribute to those who died of the virus.

In the two weeks from March 30, the world leaders have spoken four times over the phone, with the most recent call on Easter Sunday.  It's an unprecented amount of contact for the two presidents, and CNN reports that Trump and Putin discussed the COVID-19 pandemic and the oil market war between Russia and Saudi Arabia.  While they appear to be easing relations between Washington and the Kremlin, political analysts are warning that this is all part of Putin's plan to undermine the United States.  Since March 30, President Trump and Vladimir Putin spoke four times over the phone as the coronavirus pandemic rages on  'Reaching out to the United States is part of part of Putin's long-term plan to basically undermine the credibility of the United States as an important stalwart player in the global system, to undermine our alliances, and then to create as many lasting sources of tension between Donald Trump and his own national security team,' Andrew Weiss, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told CNN.  'The more that Russia succeeds in doing that, the less pressure Russia itself is likely to face from a unified western camp,' he added.  After their final talk on Sunday, Donald Trump touted that a historic deal had been reached to stop the oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia and help shore up oil prices amid the coronavirus pandemic – thanking Vladimir Putin and Mohammad Bin Salman for working toward the agreement.  'The big Oil Deal with OPEC Plus is done,' Trump posted to Twitter Easter Sunday. 'This will save hundreds of thousands of energy jobs in the United States.'  'I would like to thank and congratulate President Putin of Russia and King Salman of Saudi Arabia. I just spoke to them from the Oval Office. Great deal for all!' the president praised.  Their last call came on Easter Sunday before Trump touted that a historic deal had been made between Russia and Saudi Arabia in their oil war  As part of the OPEC+ agreement, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and 21 other countries agreed to collectively reduce oil output by 9.7 million barrels per day between May and June, in a multinational effort to address a drop in global demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic.  Days after their talks a Russian jet flew within 25 feet of a US surveillance plane during an 'unsafe' maneuver at high-speed over the Mediterranean Sea.  A Kremlin SU-35 carried out an 'inverted' intercept on a US P-8A Poseidon aircraft that lasted 42 minutes on Wednesday, according to the US Navy.  According to the statement one of the Navy's aircraft was intercepted by the Russian jet while flying in international airspace over the Mediterranean Sea.  It was claimed by the Navy that its aircraft 'was operating consistent with international law and did not provoke this Russian activity' when it was approached by the jet.

Gathering senators for the first time since March risks lawmakers as well the cooks, cleaners, police officers and other workers who keep the lights on at the Capitol complex.“We will continue to stand together for the American people — even as we stand 6 feet apart,” McConnell said ahead of the opening.Trump himself offered Congress access to the instant virus test system used to screen visitors to the White House. But in an extraordinary rebuff, McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement Saturday that they would “respectfully decline\" the offer and instead direct resources to the front lines “where they can do the most good.”Related — Pelosi: States, cities seek $1T to avert layoffsFor Senate Republicans, returning to session is an attempt to set the terms of debate as Democrats push for another pricey coronavirus relief bill. Frustrated after Pelosi boosted Democratic priorities in earlier aid packages, an unprecedented $3 trillion in emergency spending, they are resisting more. Republicans are counting on the country's reopening and an economic rebound as their best hope to limit a new round of big spending on virus aid. As the Senate gavels in and the 430-member House stays away on the Capitol physician's advice, the Congress provides a snapshot of divided America struggling to confront the COVID-19 crisis. Some states are reopening, others are staying closed and questions abound.Senators face few new rules for operating in the pandemic beyond the recommendations that they wear masks — blue face coverings will be available for free — keep their distance and leave most staff at home. Hand sanitizer is back in stock. But public access will be limited, including at public hearings. The Capitol itself remains closed to visitors and tours. Democrats complain they are returning to a noticeably light agenda, packed with confirmation hearings for Trump's judicial and executive branch nominees, but with little emphasis on the pandemic and Great Depression-level economic collapse.“Democrats are going to fight like hell,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on a conference call with Latino leaders. “We're going to make sure people have enough money to live and get back on their feet.\" In making his snap decision to return, McConnell said the Senate cannot “sit on the sidelines.” He compared the senators to the essential work force of grocery clerks, truck drivers and others keeping Americans fed during the crisis. But Capitol Hill erupted in the days after the attending physician, facing questions from top GOP officials, said the health office did not have the means to perform instant virus tests on returning lawmakers. On Saturday, Trump stepped in.“There is tremendous CoronaVirus testing capacity in Washington for the Senators returning to Capital Hill on Monday,” Trump tweeted. Ninety minutes later, Health Secretary Alex Azar tweeted that the administration would be sending three machines and 1,000 virus tests to Capitol Hill.In the rare joint statement, the congressional leaders said Congress will use the existing protocols from the Capitol physician \"until these speedier technologies become more widely available.”The haphazard approach — to testing, health guidelines and the broader reopening — is what Democrats say is inadequate in the Republican response to the crisis.With more than 65,000 U.S. deaths due to the virus and 30 million Americans suddenly unemployed, Democratic senators say the focus needs to be singular — to ease this crisis and prevent a second wave of infections.“If we’re going to go back, let’s do something about COVID,” Schumer said. Instead, the agenda is focused on the president’s nominees. Among them is Justin Walker, a conservative, McConnell-backed pick to be a federal judge on the U.S. Courts of Appeal in the District of Columbia Circuit, which is seen as a stepping stone to the Supreme Court. A nomination hearing also is scheduled for John Ratcliffe, the Texas Republican congressman who is Trump's choice to lead the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.Several committees will meet to debate issues related to the virus outbreak, including the nominee for a new oversight commission. The Health Committee will hold a session on potential cures and the Commerce Committee a hearing on the airline industry. Yet as much as the world has changed during the global pandemic, the Senate remains a place of traditions.Republican senators still plan to sit down for their regular luncheons, though the physician's social distancing guidance limits them to three to a table. It was after one of their lunches in March that several senators went into self-quarantine because of their exposure to fellow GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who tested positive.Democrats, who will meet for lunch over conference call, are assessing whether to appear in person for the committee hearings or dial in remotely. The physician's office sent guidelines late Friday encouraging Senate offices to minimize staff presence and reschedule any visitors who are visibly ill with “shaking chills” or “vomiting.”Politically, operating the Senate even in a diminished capacity aligns with Trump’s effort to return to a sense of normalcy.It also draws a stark contrast with Pelosi’s House, its return date uncertain. Trump has mocked House Democrats as enjoying a \"vacation.” Republicans worry that support for Trump is drifting as he responds to the coronavirus, a drag on the GOP that threatens McConnell’s majority. Confronting his own reelection in fall, McConnell is eager to show the Senate is working. Drawing GOP senators back to Washington, McConnell can more directly involve them in the new round of deliberations.“I look forward to seeing my colleagues on Monday,\" he said in a statement.

Shortly after Trump spoke, the government announced a worrisome development: Another person in the U.S. is infected — someone in California who doesn’t appear to have the usual risk factors of having traveled abroad or being exposed to another patient.  At a White House news conference, Trump sought to minimize fears as he insisted the U.S. is “very, very ready” for whatever the COVID-19 outbreak brings. Under fire about the government’s response, he put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of coordinating the efforts.  “This will end,” Trump said of the outbreak. “You don’t want to see panic because there’s no reason to be panicked.”  But standing next to him, the very health officials Trump praised for fighting the new coronavirus stressed that schools, businesses and individuals need to get ready.  “We do expect more cases,” said Dr. Anne Schuchat of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  If the CDC confirms that the latest U.S. case doesn’t involve travel or contact with an infected person, it would be a first in this country and a sign that efforts to contain the virus’ spread haven’t been enough.  “It’s possible this could be an instance of community spread of COVID-19,” the CDC said in a statement.  More than 81,000 cases of COVID-19, an illness characterized by fever and coughing and in serious cases shortness of breath or pneumonia, have occurred since the new virus emerged in China.  The newest case from California brings the total number infected in the U.S. to 60, most of them evacuated from outbreak zones.  Trump credited border restrictions that have blocked people coming into the U.S. from China for keeping infections low so far. But now countries around the world — from South Korea and Japan to Italy and Iran — are experiencing growing numbers of cases. Asked if it was time to either lift the China restrictions, or take steps for travelers from elsewhere, he said: “At a right time we may do that. Right now it’s not the time.”  Trump spent close to an hour discussing the virus threat, after a week of sharp stock market losses over the health crisis and concern within the administration that a growing outbreak could affect his reelection. He blamed the Democrats for the stock market slide, saying, “I think the financial markets are very upset when they look at the Democrat candidates standing on that stage making fools out of themselves.” And at one point he shifted to defend his overall record and predict a win in November.  A key question is whether the Trump administration is spending enough money to get the country prepared — especially as the CDC has struggled to expand the number of states that can test people for the virus. Other key concerns are stockpiling masks and other protective equipment for health workers, and developing a vaccine or treatment.  Health officials have exhausted an initial $105 million in emergency funding and have been looking elsewhere for dollars. Earlier this week, Trump requested $2.5 billion from Congress to fight the virus. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York countered with a proposal for $8.5 billion.  Trump told reporters he was open to spending “whatever’s appropriate.”  Trump compared the new virus repeatedly to the flu, which kills tens of thousands each year. The new coronavirus has killed more than 2,700 — most in China and none in the U.S. so far — but scientists still don’t understand who’s most at risk or what the actual death rate is.  Without a vaccine, CDC’s Schuchat advised people to follow “tried and true, not very exciting” but important precautions: Wash your hands, cover your coughs and stay home when you’re sick.  A day earlier, another CDC official, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, was even more blunt, telling Americans to get ready for some of the same steps as occurred during the 2009 flu pandemic, such as school closings. “It’s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen — and how many people in this country will have severe illness,” she said.  The National Institutes of Health’s top infectious disease chief cautioned a vaccine won’t be ready for widespread use for a year or more. But Dr. Anthony Fauci said even if the virus wanes soon, it’s “quite conceivable” that it might “come back and recycle next year.” By then, he said, “we hope to have a vaccine.”  Democrats were quick to condemn Trump’s response to the outbreak. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it “opaque and chaotic.”  “Instead of listening to public health and medical experts, the president has been downplaying the potential impact of the virus for over a month,” said Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee.  Thompson added that putting Pence, “someone with no public health expertise, in charge of the response will not instill confidence with the American people and raises questions about the administration’s ability to coordinate an effective response to a complex public health threat.”  During his time as Indiana’s governor, Pence faced criticism for his response to a public health crisis in the southern part of the state.  In 2015, Scott County saw the number of people infected with HIV skyrocket, with nearly 200 people testing positive for the virus in a span of months. Indiana law at the time prohibited needle exchanges, exacerbating the outbreak, which primarily infected intravenous users of the painkiller Opana.  Pence had long opposed needle exchanges but was eventually persuaded to issue an executive order allowing one in Scott County. Despite his own misgivings — Pence said he didn’t support the exchanges as an “anti-drug policy” — he signed a law allowing the state government to approve them on a case-by-case basis.

GE Healthcare and Ford Motor Company will work together to scale the production of ventilators, arming clinicians with medical equipment important in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Through this collaboration, Ford will provide its technical and production expertise with the goal of manufacturing a simplified design of GE Healthcare’s existing ventilator. This new system would be built specifically to address urgent needs during the pandemic, equipped with the essential functions required to safely treat COVID-19 patients.  “ We are encouraged by how quickly companies from across industries have mobilized to help address the growing challenge we collectively face from COVID-19,” said GE Healthcare president and CEO Kieran Murphy. “ We are proud to bring our clinical and technical expertise to this collaboration with Ford, working together to serve unprecedented demand for this life-saving technology and support clinicians as they meet patient needs.”  “ We’re so proud to be working closely with GE Healthcare on this important effort, and we have empowered our teams of engineers and designers to be scrappy and creative to quickly help scale up their production of this vital equipment,” said Jim Hackett, Ford’s president and CEO.  Additionally, in alignment with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) guidance, GE Healthcare has provided information on its website on the use of its anesthesia devices for patients requiring mechanical ventilation. This information helps make ventilation capabilities more widely available to support patients with respiratory failure or difficulty breathing caused by COVID-19. Clinicians can use these details in the treatment of patients at their discretion. As a leading global provider of anesthesia devices with a global installed base of over 100,000 devices, this update provides immediate assistance in the global demand of ventilators.  This update follows an earlier statement from Murphy around the company’s efforts to increase its manufacturing capacity for medical equipment, including ventilators. Since the COVID-19 outbreak began, GE Healthcare has doubled its capacity of ventilator production and has plans to double it again by end of Q2 2020 to address unprecedented demand – independent of the collaboration with Ford.

The South Korean and the Chinese government have both rejected the reports:  Two South Korean government officials rejected an earlier CNN report citing an unnamed U.S. official saying Washington was “monitoring intelligence” that Kim was in grave danger after surgery, but they did not elaborate on whether Kim had undergone surgery. The presidential Blue House said there were no unusual signs coming from North Korea.   ...  An official at the Chinese Communist Party’s International Liaison Department, which deals with North Korea, told Reuters the source did not believe Kim was critically ill. China is North Korea’s only major ally. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing was aware of reports about the health of Kim, but said it does not know their source, without commenting on whether it has any information about the situation.  The report was bad for the South Korean markets:  South Korean shares exposed to North Korea tumbled and the Korean won fell on the reports. The won traded down more than 1% against the dollar even as South Korean government sources said Kim was not gravely ill.  The DailyNK has since published a correction. It now says that Kim might have had a heart problem but is recovering well. The NBC News correspondent Katy Tur deleted her tweet out of a laughable 'abundance of caution'.  When they published the sensational claims none of the western reports mentioned that the DailyNK is not a regular news outlet. It is a website in Seoul which is run by defectors from North Korea. It has for years been financed by the U.S. government through the National Endowment for Democracy which is a CIA offshot. From the NED's 2018 grant report:  The Daily NK - $270,000 To raise awareness and understanding of the conditions in North Korea by disseminating accurate, timely, and relevant news and information about the country. The project will produce an online newspaper serving readers in South Korea and the international community, and will provide journalism training to North Koreans working as citizen journalists as well as ongoing professional development for its regionally-based correspondents and stringer reporters.  The DailyNK is a run of the mill U.S. propaganda organization which prepares for a U.S. 'regime change' operation in North Korea.  Earlier records show that the DailyNK has received NED money since at least 2006. Between 2016 and 2019 it received a total of $1,120,000.  When U.S. officials claimed they were 'monitoring intelligence' about Kim Jong Un's health they meant that they were reading the fake news the people at the desk next to them just had produced.  Having been caught falling for a CIA rumor mill report the New York Times engaged in a Trump like move and blamed North Korea for its false reporting: Speculation Over Kim Jong-un’s Health Is Fueled by North Korea’s Own Secrecy.  There might be malicious intent behind the initiation of today's rumor. South Korean President Moon Jae-in is not well liked by U.S. North Korea hawks. Last week Moon's ruling party won an absolute majority in the parliamentary elections. The landslide win came after much success during the recent efforts to contain the novel coronavirus in South Korea.  There is a silent war between the Trump administration, represented by the hawkish U.S. ambassador in Seoul Harry Harris, and the Moon government.  Trump is demanding that South Korea pay $5 billion per year for the stationing of U.S. occupation troops in the country. That is five times more than South Korea currently pays. South Korea has rejected such a hefty increase and the U.S. furloughed 5,000 South Korean workers who were employed on its bases. The negotiations have since stalled.  Ambassador Harris has engaged in sabotage of South Korean policies. Here is just one example. The country recently acquired a Global Hawk reconnaissance drone but wanted to keep that a secret. Despite urgent requests for secrecy from the Moon government Harris tweeted about the arrival of the drone:  US Ambassador Harry Harris disclosed the delivery of the Global Hawk (RQ-4), a US surveillance asset, to the South Korean military and shared a photograph of it despite efforts by South Korean military officials to dissuade him, it has been learned. Observers criticized his unilateral decision to disclose information about his host country’s military in defiance of its wishes as overstepping his authority as a diplomatic representative.   ...  Many in and around the military viewed Harris’s tweet as “irregular.” “The Global Hawk is being introduced to South Korea through Foreign Military Sales (FMS) procedures supervised by the US government, but it is unquestionably a surveillance asset of the South Korean Air Force, not the US military,” said one military official. “As a former commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, Ambassador Harris may be quite interested in military issues, but it crosses a line for him to unilaterally disclose South Korean military information,” the official continued.  It would not be beyond Harris to launch rumors about North Korea's leader if only to throw the South Korean government off balance.

JOHNSON and GILLIAN FLACCUS  SEATTLE (AP) — Health officials in Washington state said Sunday night that a second person had died from the coronavirus.  Researchers said the virus may have been circulating for weeks undetected in the greater Seattle area.  In a statement, Public Health—Seattle & King County said a man in his 70s died Saturday. On Friday, health officials said a man in his 50s died of coronavirus. Both had underlying health conditions, and both were being treated at a hospital in Kirkland, Washington, east of Seattle.  Washington state now has 12 confirmed cases.  State and local authorities stepped up testing for the illness as the number of new cases grew nationwide, with new infections announced in California, Illinois, Rhode Island, New York and Washington state.  Authorities in the Seattle area said two more people had been diagnosed with the COVID-19 virus, both men in their 60s who were in critical condition, and two health care workers in California were also diagnosed.  A man in his 50s died in Washington on Saturday, and health officials said 50 more people in a nursing facility in Kirkland, Washington, are sick and being tested for the virus. On Sunday night, the International Association of Fire Fighters said 25 members who responded to calls for help at the nursing facility are being quarantined.  The first U.S. case was a Washington state man who had visited China, where the virus first emerged, but several recent cases in the U.S. have had no known connection to travelers.  In California, two health care workers in the San Francisco Bay area who cared for an earlier coronavirus patient were diagnosed with the virus on Sunday, the Alameda and Solano counties said in a joint statement.  The health care workers are both employed at NorthBay VacaValley Hospital in Vacaville, California, and had exposure to a patient treated there before being transferred to UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, the statement said. That patient was the first person in the U.S. discovered to have contracted the coronavirus with no known overseas travel.  Alameda County declared a state of emergency on Sunday following the news.  Elsewhere, authorities announced Sunday a third case in Illinois and Rhode Island and New York’s first cases as worried Americans swarmed stores to stock up on basic goods such as bottled water, canned foods and toilet paper.  The hospitalized patient in Rhode Island is a man in his 40s who had traveled to Italy in February. New York confirmed Sunday that a woman in her late 30s contracted the virus while traveling in Iran. The patient is not in serious condition. She has respiratory symptoms and has been in a controlled situation since arriving in New York, according to a statement from the governor’s office.  As the fallout continued, Vice President Mike Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar sought to reassure the American public that the federal government is working to make sure state and local authorities are able to test for the virus. Both said during a round of TV talk show appearances Sunday that thousands more testing kits had been distributed to state and local officials, with thousands more to come.  “They should know we have the best public health system in the world looking out for them,” Azar said, adding that additional cases will be reported and the overall risk to Americans is low.  As the cases ticked up, some Americans stocked up on basic supplies — particularly in areas with diagnosed cases — and began to take note of the impact on daily life. Stores such as Costco sold out of toilet paper, bottled water and hand sanitizer outside Portland, Oregon, where a case was announced Friday. Sports games and practices were canceled into the coming school week. Some churches said they would not offer communion because of fears of viral spread.  As Americans prepared, researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington on Sunday said they had evidence the virus may have been circulating in the state for up to six weeks undetected — a finding that, if true, could mean hundreds of undiagnosed cases in the area. They posted their research online, but it was not published in a scientific journal or reviewed by other scientists.  Trevor Bedford, an associate professor who announced the preliminary findings on the virus in Washington state, said on Twitter late Saturday that genetic similarities between the state’s first case on Jan. 20 and a case announced Friday indicated the newer case may have descended from the earlier one. The Jan. 20 case was the first known case in the U.S.  “I believe we’re facing an already substantial outbreak in Washington State that was not detected until now due to narrow case definition requiring direct travel to China,” he said on Twitter.  Bedford did not immediately reply to an e-mail requesting an interview Sunday.  Scientists not affiliated with the research said the results did not necessarily surprise them and pointed out that for many people — especially younger, healthier ones — the symptoms are not much worse than a flu or bad cold.  “We think that this has a pretty high rate of mild symptoms and can be asymptomatic. The symptoms are pretty non-specific and testing criteria has been pretty strict, so those combinations of factors means that it easily could have been circulating for a bit without us knowing,” said Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  Dr. Adam Lauring of University of Michigan called the findings “high quality work” from scientists who’ve done similar work with the flu virus for years.  “They show their data and they show their work,” Lauring said. “It’s more than a series of tweets” because the researchers back up what they found with data that they’ve shared online. “If there’s something wrong, someone will find it.”  Dr. Carlos del Rio of Emory University School of Medicine said the findings are from respected researchers in genomic sequencing and they make sense because of the geographic proximity of the two cases.  “This is a good time to reinforce the things we all should be doing to stop the spread of flu. Wash your hands. Don’t touch your face. If you have a cold, stay home … It’s a good time to remind ourselves of that,” he said.  Pence, named by the president to be the point-person overseeing the government’s response, said more than 15,000 virus testing kits had been released over the weekend. And, the administration is working with a commercial provider to distribute 50,000 more, he said.  The vice president said testing was among the first issues raised by governors he’s spoken with so far. Several states have begun their own testing, including Washington state, Oregon and Illinois.  “We’re leaning into it,” Pence said.  Azar said more than 3,600 people already have been tested for coronavirus and the capability exists to test 75,000 people. He forecast a “radical expansion of that” in the coming weeks.  Pence and Azar spoke a day after President Donald Trump approved new restrictions on international travel to prevent the spread within the U.S. of the new virus, which originated in China. There are now more than 80,000 cases worldwide and about 3,000 deaths.  Two Americans are now known to have died of the virus, one in Washington state and one in China.  The new U.S. travel restrictions apply to Iran, although travel there by Americans already is severely limited, as well as heavily affected regions of Italy and South Korea. Trump tweeted Sunday that any travelers from those countries will be screened when they arrive in the U.S.  The number of known coronavirus cases in the U.S. had reached76 as of Sunday, counting people evacuated from a cruise ship and the city of Wuhan in China.  Trump said Saturday at a White House news conference that he was thinking about closing the southern border with Mexico as a precaution. Azar said Sunday that Mexico has few coronavirus cases and that it would take a dramatic change in the circumstances there to prompt serious consideration of a border shutdown.

Pence noted that an infectious disease expert is joining an existing White House coronavirus task force on Monday. Last week, Pence announced the addition of Debbie Birx, a State Department ambassador-at-large and medical doctor who is the administration’s global HIV/AIDS response coordinator, to the virus panel.  Despite calls by Trump and Pence for political unity in the face of the viral threat, the issue has become mired in the partisan rancor in Washington, with both Republicans and Democrats accusing each other of mining the issue for political gain.  Trump, at a political rally last week, accused Democrats of “politicizing” the issue and said their criticism of his handling of the public health challenge was their new “hoax.”  At the White House on Saturday, Trump said he was not trying to minimize the threat from the virus.  “Again, the hoax was used in respect to Democrats and what they were saying,” he said Saturday.  Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who emerged victorious Saturday night from South Carolina’s primary, criticized the administration over the availability of testing kits.  Biden also panned the administration’s decision to have political appointees Pence and Azar, neither of whom are scientists by training, appear on the Sunday shows, instead of an expert like Dr. Anthony Fauci, the National Institutes of Health infectious disease chief.  Biden claimed the administration doesn’t have testing kits. Pence and Azar said thousands of kits had been distributed.  Azar said he didn’t know what Biden was talking about when the former vice president said testing kits didn’t exist. Azar said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had developed a lab test for coronavirus with “historic speed.”  Pence was interviewed on CNN’s “State of the Union” and Azar commented on “Fox News Sunday,” CBS’ “Face the Nation” and ABC’s “This Week.” Biden commented on CNN.   ___  Flaccus reported from Portland, Oregon.

Back in October 2014, the US government had placed a federal moratorium on gain-of-function (GOF) research – altering natural pathogens to make them more deadly and infectious – as a result of rising fears about a possible pandemic caused by an accidental or deliberate release of these genetically engineered monster germs.  This was in part due to lab accidents at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in July 2014 that raised questions about biosafety at US high-containment labs.  At that time, the CDC had closed two labs and halted some biological shipments in the wake of several incidents in which highly pathogenic microbes were mishandled by US government laboratories: an accidental shipment of live anthrax, the discovery of forgotten live smallpox samples and a newly revealed incident in which a dangerous influenza strain was accidentally shipped from the CDC to another lab.  A CDC internal report described how scientists failed to follow proper procedures to ensure samples were inactivated before they left the lab, and also found “multiple other problems” with operating procedures in the anthrax lab.  As such in October 2014, because of public health concerns, the US government banned all federal funding on efforts to weaponize three viruses – influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).  In the face of a moratorium in the US, Dr Anthony Fauci – the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and currently the leading doctor in the US Coronavirus Task Force – outsourced in 2015 the GOF research to China’s Wuhan lab and licensed the lab to continue receiving US government funding.  The Wuhan lab is now at the center of scrutiny for possibly releasing the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and causing the global Covid-19 pandemic.  Additionally, the embassy warned that researchers “showed that various SARS-like coronaviruses can interact with ACE2, the human receptor identified for SARS-coronavirus,” meaning bat coronaviruses can be transmitted to humans to cause SARS-like diseases.  Now, the US is up in arms to hold China accountable for the global coronavirus pandemic, filing class-action lawsuits domestically, as well as building a coalition with allies internationally.  Lawsuits have been filed within the US and the International Criminal Court alleging that China used the virus as a bioweapon, and other suits are under way at the International Court of Justice. Republican lawmakers such as Senator Tom Cotton and Representative Dan Crenshaw have also introduced legislation that would allow Americans to sue China in federal court over the deaths and economic damage wrought by the virus.  If evidence is found that Covid-19 is a biological weapon, some pundits such as Fox News host Lou Dobbs have called for the US to declare war on China.  Nonetheless, it is unclear what the legal ramifications would be if the virus was indeed leaked from a Chinese lab, but as a result of a research project that was outsourced and funded by the US government.  Also, if there was a government ban in 2014 on federal funding being used for GOF research, what are the federal compliance and ethical issues surrounding the fact that the NIH still gave federal funding instead of private funding to the Wuhan lab to continue the experiments?  Moreover, could some strains of the coronavirus have originated in US labs, given the fact the US government lifted the ban in December 2017 on GOF research without resolving lab-safety issues?  For now, President Donald Trump’s administration is investigating the $3.7 million in taxpayer money that went to the Wuhan lab, while Republican Representative Matt Gaetz called for an immediate end to NIH funding of Chinese research. Since the federal ban on GOF research has been lifted, US labs can continue creating these monster germs domestically and would no longer need to outsource to China.  Nonetheless, there still needs to be better oversight on the dangerous experiments and regulations over biosecurity of labs.  Currently, the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) – a US government interagency panel that advises the NIH’s parent, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) – conducts risk assessment of GOF experiments that pose a significant threat to public health.  The NSABB has given the HHS a framework to assess proposed research that would create pathogens with pandemic potential, such as research on genetically altering a virus to infect more species, or recreating a pathogen that has been eradicated in the wild, such as smallpox.  However, vaccine development and epidemiological surveillance do not automatically trigger an HHS review. In the postmortem of the Covid-19 pandemic, this is likely a dangerous loophole that could be exploited with no oversight, and should probably be brought under HHS review in order to protect public health better in the future.

CAIT's Delhi NCR unit Convener Sushil Kumar Jain said the traders' community \"strongly supports\" the Prime Minister's decision to continue the lockdown in the country.  \"It is a logical and extremely important step desired under the present circumstances due to COVID-19 and we have assured Prime Minister that the traders under any circumstances will continue to run supply chain of essential goods in a most efficient and effective manner so that citizens of the country may not face any difficulty in obtaining essential commodities,\" CAIT said.  \"Due to the lock down of the past 21 days in the country, the retail trade has suffered a loss of business to the tune of Rs 3.15 lakh crores,\" it added.  Earlier on Tuesday, the Prime Minister announced that the current lockdown will be extended till May 3, saying it is necessary to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus in the country.  He said detailed guidelines on implementation of the new lockdown will be announced on Wednesday, and some relaxations may be allowed after April 20 in places where there are no hotspots.

WASHINGTON — Michael Fleming never got to say goodbye to his father. He didn’t know his dad was fading away on a ventilator, diagnosed with coronavirus at the federal prison where he was serving time for a drug charge.  His father, also named Michael, was held at FCI Terminal Island in Los Angeles and died April 19. At least half the population there has tested positive, the largest known hot spot in the federal prison system. But the first word the family received of the father’s illness was the day he died, from a prison chaplain asking if the body should be cremated and where the ashes should be sent.  “They just left us all in the dark,” Fleming said in an interview with The Associated Press. “We had to find out from the news what the actual cause of death was. It was kind of screwed up.”  The response from the federal Bureau of Prisons to the growing coronavirus crisis in prisons has raised alarm among advocates and lawmakers about whether the agency is doing enough to ensure the safety of the nearly 150,000 inmates serving time in federal facilities.  And even though officials have stressed infection and death rates inside prisons are lower compared with outside, new figures provided by the Bureau of Prisons show that out of 2,700 tests systemwide, nearly 2,000 have come back positive, strongly suggesting there are far more COVID-19 cases left uncovered.  At the same time, the Bureau of Prisons communication policies are leaving families in the dark about their loved ones’ potentially life-threatening condition.  The 59-year-old Fleming had been serving a 20-year sentence on a drug conspiracy charge. The Bureau of Prisons never notified Fleming’s family that he was taken to a hospital or when his condition declined.  “Not having the opportunity to say goodbye — that would’ve been invaluable,” the younger Fleming said. “We will never have that chance.”  Under Bureau of Prisons policy, the agency is supposed to “promptly” notify the family of inmates who have serious illnesses. But the agency, which confirmed the family wasn’t initially notified, has “discretion when making notifications,” according to a spokeswoman.  Prisons officials say they are doing the best they can under dire circumstances and following guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  “We are doing the right things to manage our population and to keep them as safe as possible at this time when we can’t provide that assurance to our average American free public that everyone is safe and secure right now with this pandemic,” said Kathy Hawk Sawyer, a senior adviser at the Bureau of Prisons who previously ran the agency twice.  As of Wednesday, 31 inmates, including Fleming, had died of the coronavirus at federal correctional facilities since late March. About 600 have recovered.  Prison officials have daily calls with CDC officials, and CDC teams have visited several correctional facilities. As part of the plan to slow the spread of the coronavirus, officials have limited inmate movement, set up tents to increase bed space, isolated inmates at some prisons and identified others for possible home confinement.  The Justice Department obtained 20 ventilators for use at hospitals housing federal prisoners, Dr. Jeffrey Allen, the bureau’s medical director, said in an interview.  In the last week, the Bureau of Prisons has obtained more than 5,000 test kits and now has 20 rapid testing machines deployed at hot spot prisons to increase testing numbers, Allen said.  He insisted that testing was in line with current CDC guidance and that officials are working daily to discover new strategies to slow the spread of the virus.  “A lot is yet unknown about how to limit its transmission in a correctional environment, and that’s why we’re collaborating with the CDC to try to identify that sort of data that can inform our management strategies going forward,” he said.  But at the Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal lockup in New York City housing 1,700 inmates, there were only nine nasal swab test kits late last month, according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of hundreds of inmates there. Just one inmate has been confirmed with coronavirus there, according to Bureau of Prisons statistics.  Deirdre D. von Dornum, attorney-in-charge of the Federal Defenders of New York in Brooklyn, said there was a reason.  “They are not testing anyone,” she said.  At the Metropolitan Correctional Center, the New York City jail where Jeffrey Epstein killed himself, inmate Guillermo Zegarra-Martinez told his attorney in an email that his cellmate tested positive for the coronavirus and was put in isolation for more than two weeks.  But Zegarra-Martinez was not tested even though he was shaking in his cell with a fever during nights while experiencing pain throughout his body in the week before his cellmate was taken out and the week after, the inmate wrote.  The sick inmate was taken out of the cell only “because he was coughing on the face of the guy” who took his temperature, Zegarra-Martinez said, according to his lawyer, Sabrina Shroff.  Advocates and even prison guards have been calling for reforms to head off outbreaks in a prison system plagued for years by violence, misconduct and staffing shortages. Nearly 350 staff members have tested positive.  Staff are sent around the country to pick up shifts, and union officials say the shortages are still so severe that officers are sometimes working 24 hours in a row. At a prison in Elkton, Ohio, where seven inmates have died, the governor called in the National Guard to help supplement medical staff.  Officers worry that the protective equipment they’ve been given isn’t adequate to protect them from daily contact with inmates, especially at facilities where dozens have tested positive.  But Hawk Sawyer said the Bureau of Prisons is prepared with ample amount of personal protective equipment and supplies, including soap and disinfectant.  “We are creating and making the masks for the staff, as well as the shields and hand sanitizer and all kinds of things,” she said.

The Denver Nuggets announced on Thursday that a member of the organization – not necessarily a player – tested positive for the novel strain of coronavirus after experiencing symptoms Monday. The Bucks' last game before the NBA's shutdown came against the Nuggets in Denver on March 9.  \"The testing was undertaken following guidance from state public health officials and team physicians,\" the Nuggets said in a release. \"The health and safety of our players, our organization, those throughout our league, and all those potentially impacted by this situation is paramount.  \"The Nuggets will continue to work in coordination with team physicians, public health officials and infectious disease experts, while focusing on the health and safety of everyone in our community.\"  LIVE UPDATES: The latest on coronavirus in Wisconsin  DAILY DIGEST: What you need to know about coronavirus in Wisconsin  MORE COVERAGE: Coronavirus in the U.S and around the world  The Bucks lost that March 9 game in Denver, 109-95. Seven regular rotation players – Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, Eric Bledsoe, Brook Lopez, George Hill, Donte DiVincenzo and Marvin Williams – did not participate in the game, but all players and coaches were at the Pepsi Center that night.  Since the league suspended all games on March 11, the entire Bucks organization has been doing its part to follow social distancing guidelines. As of Thursday, no players or members of Milwaukee's basketball franchise are known to have tested positive.  NBA commissioner Adam Silver said Wednesday night that he's not sure when the league will resume play or how the season will be structured when that does happen. For now, NBA players can remain in their team markets or travel to their homes within North America, but they won't be able to work out anywhere other than their own homes.  According to reports, team practice facilities have been shut down to all players and staff and players are indefinitely barred from practicing in public health clubs or gyms, a measure intended to enforce social distancing and limit the spread of the disease.  As of Thursday, at least 10 NBA players are known to have tested positive for COVID-19 after the Los Angeles Lakers announced positive test results for two players and Boston Celtics guard Marcus Smart tweeted a video announcing he has coronavirus. The Bucks played the Lakers three days before their game in Denver.  The Philadelphia 76ers also announced that three members of their organization have tested positive.

But why is this? Lockdown lives are, for many, less fraught, busy and packed with diary events and schedules.  According to Sydney-based sleep expert Olivia Arezzolo, the feelings of fatigue that you are experiencing are more likely to be related to the mental workload associated with COVID-19 rather than the physical burden.  Sydney-based sleep expert Olivia Arezzolo (pictured) said the feelings of fatigue that you are experiencing are more likely to be related to the mental workload associated with COVID-19 rather than the physical burden  'Stress exhausts the body - it's as simple as that,' Olivia told FEMAIL. 'It's particularly exhausting if it's long-lasting.'  The sleep expert explained how stress works via the 'general adaptation syndrome'.  What are the three stages of overcoming stress? 1. ALARM PHASE: During this stage, you might feel more energised, alert and awake - driven by adrenaline and cortisol. 2. RESISTANCE PHASE: The second stage occurs when the stress is chronic, and you might feel as though you aren't as energised and wired, but you'll still be more alert than normal. 3. EXHAUSTION PHASE: This stage essentially describes the depletion of our bodily systems, a natural consequence of ongoing elevated cortisol. Cortisol stops us from getting deep sleep and compromises the body's ability to create the happiness hormone, serotonin. Advertisement  'This describes the following three phases,' she said.  'Initially, when we are faced with stress, we have the \"alarm phase\": a period where we are more energised, alert and awake - driven by adrenaline and cortisol - the stress hormone. This allows us to cope with the challenge.'  The second phase, Olivia said, is the 'resistance phase'.  'This occurs when the stress is chronic, like the coronavirus and its subsequent effects,' she said.  'You may feel during this that you aren't as energised and \"wired\" as you were in the alarm phase, but you'll still be more alert than normal'.  The third phase - which many of us will have entered by now - is the 'exhaustion phase'.  'If the stress hasn't subsided, you hit the exhaustion phase, which essentially describes the depletion of our bodily systems, a natural consequence of ongoing elevated cortisol,' Olivia said.  'High cortisol limits our ability to get deep sleep - which is critical to our energy levels - and it also compromises the body's ability to create happiness hormones like serotonin - meaning we feel emotionally drained too.'  'Stress exhausts the body - it's as simple as that,' Olivia told FEMAIL. 'It's particularly exhausting if it's long-lasting,' she said (stock image)  So how can we try to ease the transition and make sure we feel a bit better rested during this stressful time?  Olivia explained that the first thing you need to do is get back into some sort of a routine, and make sleep a priority between 10pm and 2am.  'Many of use are used to prioritising Netflix or social media in these hours instead of sleep - especially right now,' she said.  'But if there is any time we need to be asleep, it's within this time frame.'  The expert highlighted clinical studies, which all show we are more likely to have deep sleep during this time-frame, which is 'critical' to you feeling energised the next morning.  Olivia (pictured) recommends you look after yourself by taking a magnesium supplement in the morning and at night, and also prioritising a bedtime routine  What is Olivia Arezzolo's 10-step bedtime routine? 1. Create a sleep sanctuary: Remove any blue light from iPhones and devices and keep your bedroom for sleep and relaxation. 2. Block blue light: Do not allow blue light into the bedroom and restrict this two hours from bedtime. 3. Set a goodnight alarm for your phone: At this point switch it off so you wake fully refreshed. 4. Diffuse lavender: Diffuse lavender either onto your pillows or throughout the room to promote relaxation. 5. Have an evening shower or bath: This helps to promote relaxation 45-60 minutes before bed. 6. Drink chamomile tea: Do this an hour before bed to make you calm. 7. Take a magnesium supplement: This helps the muscles to relax. 8. Practise gratitude: Think about what you are grateful for. 9. Try meditation: This can be useful to help you sleep. 10. Practise deep breathing: This makes it easier to sleep. Source: Olivia Arezzolo Advertisement  The second thing you should do is start a bedtime routine before you turn the lights out.  Olivia has a ten-step routine that includes things like diffusing lavender, blocking any blue light from your phone or laptop and drinking chamomile tea which can't help but get you into the right place for sleep.  Olivia also said it's worth taking a magnesium supplement, both in the morning and at night.  'Magnesium has been shown in clinical trials to reduce anxiety by 31 per cent,' she said.  'Most of us are used to taking it in the evening, however to take it in the morning is also recommended in these circumstances.  'The body uses additional magnesium under stress, so you're likely to need the extra boost.'  The fourth and final thing she said you should do is prioritise stress management first thing in the morning to get your day off on the right foot.  'I strongly advise that you make meditation the first thing you do upon waking,' Olivia said.  'It changes the structure within the brain (called the HPA axis), lessening cortisol release.'  Olivia said that as a result of doing some meditation, you will feel less anxious and wired, and if you do become stressed, it won't affect you as much.  'Doing it first thing in the morning is best as you won't necessarily find the time later in the day and it'll help you to deal with anything in your day,' Olivia said.

Brett Crozier, sent a letter Monday up his chain of command sounding the alarm, the Navy’s top admiral told reporters Wednesday.  The letter was most likely the result of a misunderstanding about how quickly the process would move, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday told reporters. It was first leaked to the San Francisco Chronicle and quickly gained national attention ― a sort of canary in the coal mine for what the military is facing as coronavirus spreads throughout an organization whose members live in close quarters and one that can ill afford to sideline a significant percentage its personnel.  “Let me emphasize that this is exactly what we want our commanding officers, our medical teams, to do,” acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly said, though he later lamented that the letter went public.  There had been a plan in place to begin moving sailors off the ship, Gilday said, but Crozier wanted it done more quickly than leadership was comfortable with.  In a Tuesday appearance on CBS News Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he did not believe the Roosevelt needed to be evacuated, but acknowledged the remaining carrier fleet could fill in if it did end up sidelined.  “I have not had a chance to read that letter, read it in detail,\" Esper said. \"Again, I’m going to rely on the Navy chain of command to go out there to assess the situation and make sure they provide the captain and the crew all the support they need to get the sailors healthy.”  Modly and Esper discussed the issue yesterday, Modly told Military Times.  × Fear of missing out?

As of Wednesday, a thousand of the ship’s 4,800-sailor crew have disembarked and are being isolated in facilities on Guam’s U.S. Air Force and Navy bases.  Local commanders are also working with the territory’s governor to coordinate hotel space for sailors to stay isolated under the single-occupancy, single-restroom standards the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends.  In the meantime, nearly a quarter of the ship’s sailors have been tested for COVID-19, and deep-cleaning protocols are in place to protect those who are still aboard.  “One thing I want to emphasize is we cannot and will not move all of the sailors off the ship,” Modly said. “It’s important to understand that just because it’s big and it floats and it has lots of people on it, the comparison to a cruise ship pretty much ends there.”  A skeleton crew of hundreds will have to stay on board, he explained, not only to maintain the ship’s nuclear reactor, but to protect the carrier’s weapons and other systems.  “Taking the sailors off the ship does not make them safer,” he said, adding that Crozier’s manning proposal was too low.  “I don’t believe we can do it with 10 percent.”  But Crozier’s most cutting critique came at the end of his letter, when he warned that if the Navy didn’t take immediate action, it would be failing to protect sailors.  “My response to that is it’s disappointing to have him say that,” Modly said. “However, at the same time, I know that’s not the truth.”  A memo went out to commanding officers Tuesday night, Gilday said, reiterating that it’s their job to identify issues in their formations and reach out to higher commands if they need assistance.  “You can’t execute those missions properly unless you have healthy crews,” Gilday said.  Of 94 ships currently underway, Modly said, the Theodore Roosevelt is the only one with active coronavirus cases on board.  As a precaution, some port visits and exercises have been adjusted or canceled, and senior leadership is looking at how slowing down will effect future training and deployment cycles.

China today claims to have roughly 82,000 confirmed cases and 3,300 deaths, but skeptics have long doubted the veracity of those figures, citing accounts from Chinese crematoriums that are processing thousands of urns with coronavirus remains every day. The classified report, which Bloomberg said was submitted to the White House, found that China's coronavirus figures are \"intentionally incomplete,\" corroborating circumstantial evidence that China falsified its figures.  \"A *single mortuary* in Wuhan reportedly ordered more urns in two days than the Chinese Communist Party has reported total deaths in the whole country,\" Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) tweeted on Sunday. \"I’m sure you’re shocked by evidence of Chinese lies.\"  Beijing has reported a steady drop in new COVID-19 cases over the last few weeks, painting a rosy picture while the rest of the world struggles to fight the pandemic. However, China's official count changes by the day as the Chinese Communist Party routinely shifts the standards for who is included in the statistics. For instance, the country started to release its daily tally of new asymptomatic patients starting Wednesday, after the public expressed concerns that asymptomatic carriers might unwittingly transmit the disease.  The report comes as Republican congressional leaders such as Rep. Jim Banks (Ind.) and Rep. Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) push to hold China accountable for exacerbating the coronavirus outbreak. These measures have encountered pushback from Democrats, who accuse Republicans of inflaming racial animosity.  In addition to falsifying its figures, China also launched an aggressive disinformation campaign in March, accusing the U.S. military of bringing the virus into Wuhan. The legislation being pushed by Banks seeks to counter those efforts by urging China to disavow that falsehood.  \"The House of Representatives calls on the Chinese Government to (A) publicly state that there’s no evidence that COVID–19 originated anywhere else but China; (B) denounce the baseless conspiracy that the United States Army placed COVID–19 in Wuhan,\" the bill states.

The medical team was on a training programme to expand their frontiers of knowledge on coronavirus for deployment in the country.  The Nigerian Ambassador to the Republic of the Congo, Deborah Iliya, said that the medical team had been stranded following the closure of air and land borders by Congo Brazzaville ostensibly, to contain the spread of the coronavirus.  The envoy in a statement on Sunday commended the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) and his government over “the systemic, practical and sincere efforts” being taken to end the scourge of COVID-19 facing Nigeria.  It read, “The medical team had been stranded following the closure of air and land borders by the host country.  “In the same vein, the Ambassador, on behalf of the Government of Nigeria, has commended the government and the good people of the Republic of Congo for the singular act of solidarity and standing on good relations by the temporal opening of her airport to facilitate the departure of the team on March 26, 2020.”  Iliya said the action of the Congolese authorities had further strengthened the bilateral relations between the two countries.  The diplomat noted that the President of the Republic of Congo, Denis Nguesso, had put in stringent measures aimed at ending the spread of the virus, adding that he had embarked on sensitisation campaigns.  She noted that the public had also been mobilised for strict observation and compliance with all medical advisory and lockdown directives.

These are mostly people who have returned abroad from high-risk areas, with few exceptions.  Meanwhile, Vísir reports that deCODE Genetics, which has been conducting volunteer screenings of those in the general population, has found 22 cases of novel coronavirus amongst 2,600 samples.  This falls in line with previous projections, which indicated a general population incidence of the virus of about 1%. deCODE is taking roughly 1,000 samples from the general population per day, and may screen as many as 17,000 people.  Meanwhile, the Icelandic government is currently meeting to discuss a potential aid package to offset the economic damage, which may include businesses closing and growing unemployment.  “This is why I say we need to take major steps now,” Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson told reporters. “We need to come in with full force.”  While there are as yet no confirmed numbers on the size of the aid package nor who would receive aid, more details are due to be announced later today after the government meets.

The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.   TOP OF THE HOUR:  - Head of Japan’s medical association: Olympics difficult without vaccine.  - Trump projecting coronavirus deaths in United States could reach 70,000.  - Airline to require all customers wear face covering while traveling.  - Wuhan again reports no new coronavirus cases or deaths.  - Workers at Chicago-area nursing homes set May 8 strike date.   ___  TOKYO - The head of Japan’s medical association thinks it will be difficult to hold the Olympics without an effective coronavirus vaccine.  “I hope vaccines and drugs will be developed as soon as possible,” Japan Medical Association President Yoshitake Yokokura said Tuesday.  Japan and the International Olympic Committee agreed to postpone the Tokyo 2020 Summer Games until July next year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Japan is under a monthlong state of emergency amid a rapid increase of infections throughout the country, where hospitals are overburdened.  Yokokura did not say whether he opposes the Olympics without a vaccine.  “The key is a situation with the infections at that point. If the infections are under control only in Japan, it will still be difficult to hold the games unless the pandemic is over in the rest of the world,” he said.  Experts have said it could take 12-18 months or longer to develop a vaccine that is safe and effective for clinical use.  Japan has 13,576 reported virus cases, plus 712 others from a cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo earlier this year, with 389 deaths, the health ministry said Tuesday.   ___  WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump is projecting that coronavirus deaths in the United States could reach 70,000, but says original projections were much higher as he explained why voters should consider re-electing him in November.  Trump has at times this month cited 60,000 as the estimate of how many people would die from COVID-19.  Trump was asked during a White House news conference on Monday whether an American president deserved to be re-elected after losing more Americans in six weeks than died in the Vietnam War. Approximately 58,000 U.S. troops were killed during the Vietnam War.  The number of dead in the U.S. from COVID-19 surpassed 55,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.  Trump said the nation has lost a lot of people.  “But if you look at what original projections were - 2.2 million - we’re probably heading to 60,000-70,000. It’s far too many. One person is too many for this. And I think we’ve made a lot of really good decisions. The big decision was closing the border or doing the ban, people coming in from China.”  Trump added: “I think we’ve done a great job. I will say this, one person is too many.”  Trump is relying on a pandemic forecast that predicted 1.5 million to 2.2 million deaths in the United States in a worst-case scenario, without efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus through social distancing.   ___  NEW YORK - JetBlue will start requiring all customers to wear a face covering while traveling, the airline announced Monday.  Passengers will be required to cover their nose and mouth during check-in, boarding, in flight and while deplaning. The policy goes into effect May 4.  “This is the new flying etiquette,” Joanna Geraghty, president and chief operating officer of JetBlue, said in a news release. “Onboard, cabin air is well circulated and cleaned through filters every few minutes but this is a shared space where we have to be considerate of others.”  Delta announced earlier Monday that it will require flight attendants to wear masks starting Tuesday, and American Airlines said Monday night it will mandate the same beginning May 1. The airlines will join United, JetBlue and Frontier in requiring masks be worn by flight attendants during flights.  The new regulations follow outrage on social media over a crowded American Airlines flight with many passengers not wearing masks. The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents United flight attendants but not those at JetBlue, American, Delta or Southwest, asked the federal government to require that passengers wear masks.   ___  SEOUL, South Korea - South Korea has reported 14 new cases of the coronavirus and one more death, bringing its national totals to 10,752 cases and 244 fatalities.  South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday said four of the fresh cases were from the capital of Seoul and two were from the hardest-hit city of Daegu, where infections have waned after a surge in late February and early March that overwhelmed hospital capacities.  At least 1,056 infections have been linked to international arrivals. The country was reporting around 500 new cases per day in early March, but hasn’t reported a daily jump above 100 since April 1.  With its caseload slowing, South Korea has started to relax social distancing guidelines and shift its focus to easing the economic shock. President Moon Jae-in during a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday said the trade-dependent economy is going through a “warlike situation” amid the pandemic that has hurt major industries including airlines, marine transport and shipbuilding while calling for “all-out efforts” to protect companies and jobs.   ___  BEIJING - The Chinese city of Wuhan that was the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic again reported no new cases or deaths Tuesday and its hospitals remained empty of virus patients for a second straight day.  China as a whole reported six new cases, three of them brought from overseas and three in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, which borders Russia. No new deaths were reported nationwide and 648 current confirmed cases remained registered. Another 1,006 people were under isolation and monitoring, suspected of having the virus or after testing positive without showing any symptoms.  China, where the virus first emerged late last year, has reported a total of 4,633 deaths among 82,836 cases.   ___  WELLINGTON, New Zealand - Surfers greeted a spectacular sunrise in Christchurch, construction workers purchased their favorite espresso coffees and some lawmakers returned to Parliament in the capital of Wellington on Tuesday as aspects of New Zealand life began returning to normal.  The country had been in a strict lockdown for more than a month but those conditions were eased a little beginning at midnight Monday to allow some parts of the economy to restart. Among those places to reopen were construction sites, and cafes and restaurants that sell takeout food and coffee. People are still required to work from home if they can and maintain social distancing.  New Zealand on Tuesday reported three new cases of the coronavirus, bringing its total to 1,472. There have been 19 deaths.   ___  CHICAGO - Workers at 40 Chicago-area nursing homes announced they have set a May 8 strike date over wages as many of the facilities are treating patients suffering from the coronavirus.  Members of the Service Employees International Union, which represents more than 10,000 workers at 100 nursing homes, most in the Chicago area, are negotiating with the Illinois Association of Healthcare Facilities to replace a contract that expires April 30.  Shaba Andrich of the union’s nursing home division said many of the workers are making little more than Chicago’s minimum wage of $13 an hour while taking care of society’s most vulnerable members, adding they are seeking at least $15 an hour and hazard pay for working during the pandemic. The workers are also demanding improved staffing, better training and more personal protective equipment.  The strike threat comes a day after Illinois officials announced a jump to 625 deaths from the coronavirus of people who live or work at long-term care facilities. The Illinois Department of Public Health says the state has about 1,200 long-term care facilities. As of Friday, at least 278 facilities had 4,298 cases of residents and workers who tested positive for COVID-19.  The association representing nursing home operators say they have offered an 11% pay hike, stable employee health insurance contributions, earlier access to sick time during the pandemic and creation of a training fund, among other contract enhancements.   ___  UNITED NATIONS - The U.N. humanitarian chief says $90 billion could provide income support, food and a health response to the coronavirus pandemic for 700 million of the world’s most vulnerable people - a price tag just 1% of the $8 trillion stimulus package the 20 richest countries put in place to safeguard the global economy.  Mark Lowcock said on a video briefing most experts agree the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic hasn’t reached the poorest parts of the world, but might peak there in the next three to six months.  He said about 700 million people - 10% of the world’s population - are most vulnerable and concentrated in about 30 to 40 countries that already receive humanitarian assistance, and will see a big drop in incomes as the virus spreads and governments impose restrictive measures and lockdowns.  Lowcock said “if you wanted to protect them against that drop in income, then probably for about $60 billion you could do that.”  And he said for something like $30 billion, the poorest people facing the threat of starvation can get food, and the health response to COVID-19 can be financed.  Lowcock said probably two-thirds of the $90 billion could come from international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and the rest could be financed by a one-time increase in government aid to developing countries.  He said “$90 billion is a lot of money but it is an affordable sum of money.”  Lowcock said the United Nations is not going to appeal for $90 billion, but “what I am suggesting is a lot of the suffering and loss of life can be contained within sums of money which are imaginable.”   ___  SACRAMENTO, Calif. - California Gov. Gavin Newsom says the state may be just weeks away from “meaningful changes” to its stay-at-home order that took effect March 19.  But he warned Monday that progress will be jeopardized if people crowd beaches as they did in some places over the warm spring weekend. It’s one of his most optimistic timelines yet for easing coronavirus-related restrictions, though he didn’t give a firm date.  It comes as local governments seek their own changes, with some rural counties seeking to ease restrictions and those in the San Francisco Bay Area extending them through the end of May.   ___  WASHINGTON - The CDC planned to release new priorities for coronavirus testing Monday, including testing asymptomatic individuals in high-risk settings.  And the White House was set to unveil what it described as a comprehensive overview of its efforts to make testing for COVID-19 more widely available.  The White House is aiming for states to have enough tests and needed supplies to test at least 2.6% of their populations per month - a figure needed to catch asymptomatic spread.  The administration is also releasing a “testing blueprint” for states, outlining how they should prioritize testing as they devise their reopening plans.  It includes a focus on surveillance testing, as well as “rapid response” programs to isolate those who test positive and identify those they came in contact with.  The administration aims to have the market “flooded” with tests for the fall, when COVID-19 is expected to recur alongside the seasonal flu.   ___  AUSTIN, Texas - Texas Gov. Greg Abbott outlined a slow reopening of one of the world’s largest economies amid the coronavirus pandemic, allowing restaurants, retailers, movie theaters and malls to start letting customers trickle into their establishments starting Friday.  The Republican’s plan allows those establishments to let in customers up to 25% of capacity as long as they follow social distancing guidelines.  Those in counties that have reported fewer than five cases of the coronavirus will be able to serve customers at a 50% threshold unless officials see a spike in new cases.  Abbott also said he will let his monthlong stay-at-home order expire on Thursday. Bars, barbershops, hair salons and gyms remain closed.  Abbott began easing some of the restrictions last week, starting with reopening state parks, allowing “retail-to-go” and letting doctors perform nonessential surgeries.  Abbott has been under some pressure for a quicker re-opening but chose a cautious route intended to avoid a spike in new cases.  His plan will likely be met with caution in the state’s largest cities, where officials have enforced more aggressive restrictions and expressed concern that Texas ranks near the bottom per capita in testing.   ___  LIBERTY, Mo. - All Missouri businesses and social events will be allowed to re-open next week as long as residents and business owners continue to practice proper social distancing requirements, Gov. Mike Parson announced.  The Republican governor said the first phase of the re-opening might look different in various regions of the state and local governments will be able to impose stricter limitations if their officials believe it is necessary.  But he said as of next Monday, Missourians will be able to return to all businesses, such as restaurants, manufacturing plants, gyms and hair salons, along with churches, sporting events and social gatherings.  Kansas City’s stay-at-home order is scheduled to continue through May 15. St. Louis, which has had a majority of the state’s cases, has not yet said when it will lift its order.  There will be no limit on the size of social gatherings if people maintain the current 6-foot social distancing efforts but some businesses - such as retail stores - will be required to take extra steps, such as limiting occupancy, he said.   ___  The governors of Nevada and Colorado say they will join three West Coast states in coordinating on issues for reopening society amid the coronavirus pandemic.  Colorado Gov. Jared Polis and Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak said Monday that they are now part of the Western States Pact, which was announced April 13 by the governors of California, Oregon and Washington.  The group of states don’t have specific plans on how to scale back stay-at-home orders or reopen businesses.  Instead, they said they would coordinate those decisions while first considering the health of residents.  Northeastern states made a similar announcement April 13, including New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.  Polis and Sisolak emphasized the sharing of data and best practices among the Western states for modifying stay-at-home and other protective measures to combat the pandemic.  Sisolak called the partnership vital for Nevada’s recovery because of the millions of people from the West who vacation and travel to his state.   ___  BOSTON - The coronavirus kept a tight grip on hard-hit Massachusetts, which added 1,000 new deaths in just five days as the pandemic peaks in the state.  Reported deaths hit 3,003, and there are indications the true death toll could be much higher.  Officials are hopeful things could be turning a corner, but newspapers print page after page of death notices.  “The state is “still in the surge and very much in the fight against COVID-19,” Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said.  Massachusetts ranks third in confirmed U.S. cases, behind New York and New Jersey.   ___  OLYMPIA, Wash. - Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has announced that activities such as fishing, hunting and golfing can resume on May 5, at which time people can also return to state parks and other state lands for day trips.  However, Inslee said Monday that if the state sees an uptick in infections of the coronavirus or if people don’t continue to abide by social distancing protocols, the activities could once again be restricted.  Public gatherings and events, team sports and camping are all still prohibited under the current stay-at-home order that has been in place since March 23.   ___  SYDNEY - Sydney’s Bondi Beach has been re-opened to swimmers and surfers despite the local area having Australia’s highest concentration of COVID-19 cases.  The beach was opened from 7 a.m. on Tuesday until 5 p.m. with officials keeping tallies of the number of beach goers coming and going through gates to ensure social distancing. People were not permitted to linger on the sand.  Hundreds braved cool autumn weather to return to the water soon after the gates opened.  Police closed the beach five weeks ago because of thousands of people congregating there in defiance of social distancing regulations. Weeks later, a virus testing tent was established behind the beach because of the high rate of infections, particularly among backpackers who often live locally in crowded conditions.  The Waverley municipality in wealthy eastern Sydney, which includes Bondi, says it continues to have the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Australia.  Waverly Mayor Paula Masselos says the waters of Bondi, plus Bronte and Tamarama beaches to the south were re-opened “for the sole purpose of exercising.”   ___  Follow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak  Sign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters  Copyright © 2020 The Washington Times, LLC.

WHO also wanted a name that was “pronounceable and related to the disease,” he said.  The new name comes from “coronavirus,” the type of virus that causes the disease. Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause the common cold and some more serious diseases, including SARS, which killed 800 in 2002-2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome, which continues to cause sporadic cases and is believed to jump to humans from camels.  The new coronavirus that causes COVID-19 was first identified in late December in the city of Wuhan, in central China. To date, it has infected more than 42,000 people in the country and killed 1,107. Beyond China, the disease has struck 24 countries, causing 393 cases and 1 death, in the Philippines.  Tedros said having a name for the new disease is important to prevent the use of other names that might be stigmatizing.  “It also gives us a standard format to use for any future coronavirus outbreaks,” he said.

(KNWA/KFTA) — Walmart released a statement Friday requiring all employees to wear masks and face coverings at work.  See below for full statement:  Throughout this pandemic, your health and well-being has been our top priority. It was just over a month ago that we announced our COVID-19 emergency leave policy, and since then, we have taken more steps to protect you, our customers and our members with the guidance of our state and local public health officials, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), as well as our company’s own Chief Medical Officer.  Today, we are sharing another step: We will begin requiring that associates wear masks or other face coverings at work. This includes our stores, clubs, distribution and fulfillment centers, as well as in our corporate offices. We’ll also be encouraging customers and members to wear face coverings when they shop with us. We have evolved our policy on face coverings from optional to mandatory as public health guidance has shifted. The CDC now recommends wearing face coverings in public settings, including grocery stores, to help curb the spread of the virus. Although most state and local governments do not mandate the use of face coverings in public settings, the CDC has reported that recent studies show a significant portion of individuals with the virus lack symptoms and can transmit the virus. With this knowledge, we believe it is simply in everyone’s best interest to use masks or face coverings to curb the spread of this disease.  Starting Monday, you’ll be required to wear a face covering at work. You can provide your own as long as it meets certain guidelines, or we will provide you with one as you pass your associate health screen and temperature check. We’re also aware there may need to be exceptions to this policy based on local laws and individual health needs. We hope this step will promote safety and consistency across all of our facilities and be of comfort to our customers and members. However, it’s important to remember that face coverings are simply an additional health precaution. They do not guarantee against the spread of this virus, and they do not replace the most important steps you can take to keep yourself and others safe: 6-20-100. Whether at work or elsewhere, practice six feet of social distancing whenever possible. Regularly wash your hands with soap for 20 seconds. And if you have a temperature of 100 degrees or higher, stay home.  We’re also announcing today that we are extending our emergency leave policy through the end of May to ensure you have the support you need when you have to miss work. Thank you for your commitment to helping ensure Walmart and Sam’s Club are safe places to work and shop. Together, we are providing a critical service for communities across the country. During this extraordinary time, our customers and members need us more than ever. Thank you for being there for them and each other.

(Gilead Sciences via Reuters)  Government Researchers Changed Endpoint During Remdesivir Trial  Researchers changed the primary endpoint for a clinical trial testing remdesivir against COVID-19, a shift that provoked concerns among some scientists.  The endpoint is the main result measured at the end of a study. The endpoint for the remdesivir trial was originally focused on counting how many patients died after two weeks. After the trial began, it was changed to “time to recovery,” or how quickly patients were discharged after receiving the experimental drug.  Remdesivir is produced by California-based Gilead Sciences. The clinical trial was run by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).  “Little was known regarding the natural course of COVID-19 when the trial was initially designed, and the initial endpoint chosen specified a single time point for evaluation, namely day 14,” a spokesperson for the agency told The Epoch Times.  “However, with the growing knowledge during the epidemic, we learned that COVID-19 had a more protracted course than previously known. Further concerns were raised about the reliance on a single time point for evaluating treatment effects.”  The Gilead Sciences headquarters in Foster City, Calif., on April 29, 2020. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)  Statisticians modeled to see what would happen if “the right day” wasn’t picked for assessing the trial. Models showed that meaningful effects could be missed.  “Time to recovery avoids this issue, and the change in primary endpoint seemed appropriate given the evolving clinical data. This change in primary endpoint was made without any knowledge of data from ACTT, before any interim data was available,” the spokesperson said. ACTT is an acronym for the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial.  Under the new endpoint, the trial found remdesivir helped patients recover faster when compared to the control group.  “What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of NIAID, told reporters at the White House.  Results indicate the group that received the drug had a lower mortality rate, but the number hasn’t yet reached statistical significance.  The change was announced on the trial listing last month but received renewed attention after NIAID championed remdesivir last week. Researchers said the trial proved the drug worked against COVID-19, the disease caused by the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus, commonly known as the novel coronavirus.

(Ulrich Perey/Pool/AFP via Getty Images)  The positive results prompted the Food and Drug Administration to approve emergency use of remdesivir against COVID-19. Unlike other drugs being tested against the new disease, remdesivir hasn’t received official approval for any use in normal conditions anywhere in the world against any illness.  The change in endpoint, though, drew concern from some scientists.  “I think that they thought they weren’t going to win, and they wanted to change it to something they could win on,” Steven Nissen, a Cleveland Clinic cardiologist who has led drug trials, told The Washington Post. “I prefer the original outcome. It’s harder. It’s a more meaningful endpoint.  “Getting out of the hospital early is useful, but it’s not a game-changer,” he added.  The move has been described as unusual, but does happen. Dr. Todd Lee, a clinician-scientist at McGill University, said the change “makes sense.”  There were also calls for the data to be released and questions about why it hasn’t been.

(Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images)  The full results still haven’t been published. The NIAID spokesperson said there’s no firm date yet for the release. Fauci said the results are undergoing peer review.  “As much as people respect and admire and trust Dr. Fauci, they’d prefer not to take his word for it that this is promising, but to see the data themselves,” Holly Fernandez Lynch, a medical ethics professor at the University of Pennsylvania, told Quartz. “Even Tony Fauci needs peer review.”  NIAID announced the data several days earlier than it normally would have because of ethical considerations, Fauci said.  “Whenever you have clear cut evidence that a drug works, you have an ethical obligation to immediately let the people who are in the placebo group know so that they can have access,” he said.  Fauci dismissed results from another study that published full results the same day.  Chinese researchers found remdesivir wasn’t linked to a difference in time to clinical improvement. They also found signs of clinical improvement in patients given the drug earlier in the illness.

With messages varying across the country about the best way to limit the spread of the virus, Health Minister Patty Hajdu said the federal and provincial governments are looking at ways to standardize public health advice across the country.  \"Should we not be able to get consensus, that would indicate to us that we need stronger measures,\" Hajdu said at a briefing Sunday.  In Ontario, for example, the provincial police said it would intervene if people were found flouting a ban on gatherings of 50 people or more. Meanwhile Nova Scotia, the latest province to declare a state of emergency, has barred any more than five people from being together.  Premier Stephen McNeil said Sunday residents are blatantly ignoring the need for social distancing.  \"Hundreds gathering on our beaches and in our parks, large groups of people congregating, young people playing street hockey, cars parked everywhere, people disregarding law enforcement,\" McNeil said. \"We are dealing with a deadly virus and this behaviour is unacceptable.\"  Police in Nova Scotia are being given the power to enforce social distancing with $1,000 fines for individuals and $7,500 fines for businesses.  Hajdu said the best way to make sure there is a uniform approach across the country is for the provinces to collaborate. But if that fails, the federal government will step in.  \"What we're trying to do is make sure that as we go into the next week we have a much more unified approach across the country,\" she said.  For now, the federal government is strongly urging people returning from travel to self isolate, but is not enforcing it. She hopes Canadians are willing to comply voluntarily.  The federal government does have the power to invoke the Emergencies Act, which would give it extraordinary powers to limit the civil liberties of Canadians.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada is not at that point yet.  \"There are many things that are being done and can be done at the local level, at the municipal level and at the provincial level. The federal Emergencies Act is a significant step that can and should be taken when we've exhausted all other steps,\" Trudeau said at a news conference Sunday.  \"We continue to work very closely with provinces, with other jurisdictions, to make sure that they are able to do the things that need to be done and we will continue to look at if it is necessary to move forward with the Emergencies Act.\"  Hajdu said there are also powers she can invoke under the Quarantine Act to levy fines or even criminal charges against people defying self-isolation orders.  She said all Canadians should be able to expect the same level of attention and service in response to the virus, no matter where they live.  Public health officials from across the country will meet Sunday to discuss how they can unify Canada's response to the crisis.  They'll also be looking at federal standards for testing, surveillance and data provision, Hajdu said.  Canada has confirmed more than 1,400 cases of COVID-19 across the country including 19 deaths.  Those numbers include several \"signals of concern,\" said deputy chief public health officer Dr. Howard Njoo, including a sharp increase in cases, indications of community spread and cases among health workers and people in long-term care homes.  Trudeau said the country will have to drastically increase testing in order to combat the virus, but that has proven a challenge in some areas of the country.  Canada has tested 92,000 people for the virus, and more than half have been tested in the last five days.  Njoo said Canada's national lab is able to turn around results in 24 hours, but in some places it's taking closer to five days to get a result.  Provinces are also putting restrictions on who they test to reserve limited supplies like swabs and test kits.  Njoo said the government is working on solutions that will help standardize testing and make it more widely available. Health Canada approved two test kits that would be able to turn results around within hours instead of days, as an example, he said.  \"We are looking to acquire these new types of testing kits and roll them out across the country as quickly as possible,\" Njoo said.  In the meantime the government is moving forward on ways to mitigate the economic impact of the outbreak.  Parliament will resume on Tuesday so the House of Commons can debate and pass emergency legislation. Proposals would allow the government to make changes to employment insurance benefits as well as extend support to people who don't qualify for EI, among other measures.  Trudeau promised more financial aid in the coming days and weeks.  Late Saturday night 444 Canadians who had been stuck in Morocco arrived in Montreal aboard an Air Canada commercial flight from Casablanca.  Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne also tweeted late Saturday night that he has been speaking with his counterparts in Australia, Brazil, Germany, Morocco, Peru, Turkey and the United Kingdom about how to safely repatriate citizens abroad, including those stuck on cruise ships.  Trudeau urged Canadians abroad to be patient as the government organizes more flights to repatriate them. He said he hopes to be able announce more flights in the next few days.

Case in point: someone gets sick in China in December of 2019, and by March of 2020 the US shale oil industry is teetering on the brink. What’s the chain of connection?  January 2020: The coronavirus epidemic explodes, forcing China to institute a massive quarantine.  Chinese oil demand craters as a result of hundreds of millions staying home and untold numbers of businesses going offline.  March 7: Saudi Arabia asks its OPEC partners and Russia to cut oil output to keep prices from crashing.  March 9: Russia refuses, so the Saudis decide to provoke a price war by producing even more oil and selling it at a discount.  As a result, world oil prices fall from $50 (Feb. 17) to $33 (March 9).  Meanwhile, it is arguably the US, not Russia, that will be hurt most by the price war. As the world’s largest oil producer, the US has seen nearly all of its spectacular production growth in recent years coming from light, tight oil produced by fracking. But fracking is expensive; even when prices were higher, the fracking industry struggled to turn a profit on this unconventional petroleum source.  With an oil price heading toward $30 or possibly even lower, not even the most efficient fracking companies with the very best acreage can make investors happy. So, dozens of domestic US oil producers are set to go bust (unless the Trump administration bails them out).  What set off this unraveling? It was China’s deliberate—and arguably necessary—pull-back from economic connectivity. This tells us something useful about networked systems: unless there is a lot of redundancy built into them, any one node in the network can affect others. If it’s an important node (China has become the center of world manufacturing), it can disrupt the entire system. What would redundancy actually mean? If we made more of our products locally, we wouldn’t have to depend so much on China. If we produced more of our energy locally, then our energy system would probably include more redundancy (by way of more types of energy sources), and the world energy economy would be more resilient as a result. Problems would still arise, but they would be less likely to affect the whole system.  So, redundancy is important. However, redundancy is the enemy of economic efficiency. Over the past few decades, economic engineers have created just-in-time supply chains in order to minimize warehousing costs, and have lengthened supply chains in order to access the cheapest labor and materials. Fine—everybody got cheaper products, and China has grown its economy at a blistering pace. But what happens when everybody suddenly needs an N95 facemask while international supply lines are down? Officials can’t just call up the local facemask factory and order a new batch; that factory likely closed years ago.  That’s just one of the ways in which the coronavirus pandemic presents a daunting challenge to our globally networked economy—while our networked economy also complicates efforts to slow the spread of the virus. When you start to take more networks into account, the picture becomes daunting indeed. What happens to the tourism industry if millions are quarantined and nobody wants to be in close quarters with lots of strangers? How about the airlines? The restaurant and hotel chains? Even a few weeks of dramatically reduced business could be critical to their survival.  Hence government leaders and the masters of the financial universe—the central bankers—are huddling daily to try to figure out how to keep what is currently (in the US) merely a stock market blowout from turning into a serious economic depression. Unfortunately, the tools at their disposal may not be up to the job. That’s because the core problem (the pandemic) is not financial in nature. Around 70 percent of the US economy is driven directly by consumer spending. But putting money into people’s pockets through lower interest rates or government spending won’t make them suddenly decide to go on a cruise, book a flight, or even go out on Friday night to dinner and a movie.  But that’s not what concerns me most these days. Instead, it’s the social dimension of the coronavirus epidemic. Financial crises are inevitable in an economy that prioritizes the rapid growth of shareholder value and the profits of the investment class. Even more they are inevitable in an economy based on a fundamentally flawed understanding of reality—the implicit assumption that growth in resource extraction, manufacturing, and waste dumping can continue indefinitely on a finite planet. Many ecological thinkers have been making that point for years. But the response to this intrinsic vulnerability that makes the most sense, and the one my colleagues and I have been recommending, is to strengthen community resilience. That means supporting local farmers, manufacturers, merchants, arts groups, and civic organizations of all kinds. Trust is the currency that will enable us to weather the storms ahead, and trust is built largely through face-to-face interaction within communities.  However, the necessary response to the novel coronavirus is social distancing—i.e., reducing face-to-face human connectivity. As people voluntarily retreat from public gatherings, or are forced to do so by regional quarantines, severe impacts are bound to be felt by faith communities and local arts organizations, as well as local restaurants, farmers markets, and merchants. Sporting events and concerts are being canceled, and the public’s direct engagement with local and national politics is suffering as well. Public transit systems are emptying.  We need to be thinking of ways to keep civic connections alive for the next while. The pandemic will not last indefinitely: the virus itself may be here for good, but one way or another it and humanity will negotiate some sort of biological accommodation. Most likely, humans will achieve herd immunity, perhaps aided by vaccines. Our urgent task is to keep our communities healthy and resilient in the interim.  Of course, we still have the internet and social media. We should make the most of them, even though in “normal” times these often distract us from face-to-face interaction or reduce our social skills. For the time being, we can use these tools to keep up not just with the news, but with all the people we care about. I’ve even heard of innovative communitarians setting up Zoom conferences with their neighbors so they can stay in “touch.” Unfortunately, there’s no app yet that can show up at a farmers market, admire the produce, talk about the weather, and bring home a basket of fresh veggies.  Humor can help with emotionally processing difficult information (though its use can be tricky, as many people’s emotions are raw these days). There’s a lot to process—and not just fears of getting COVID-19 or of seeing a 401k disappear. Will we have to cancel our vacation? Should I go to my yoga class or stay home? How can I make ends meet if I can’t work for the next few weeks due to quarantines? How much should we disrupt our routines? Should my company be doing more to protect employees and customers? These questions and more are stoking interpersonal tensions between spouses, between parents and children, between co-workers, and between employers and employees. Normalcy bias and denial can lead to complacency when action is needed, while panic can lead to poor choices and the dismissal of one’s genuine concerns by friends and colleagues. One solution is to engage friends, neighbors, co-workers, and family in conversations about the virus, actively listen to their concerns, and gently steer those conversations in a prosocial direction that takes into account the seriousness of the situation and our need to change behavior. Ironically, the most pro-social behavior at the moment is to stay home. Meanwhile, make commonsense preparations: stock up on enough supplies to get you through a month without going out, and think about what you’ll do.  Remember: humanity has survived epidemics much worse than this one. My wife Janet just passed along this historical tidbit: it seems that early in William Shakespeare’s career as an actor and writer, London theaters were closed by order of the Privy Council (June 23, 1592), which was concerned about a plague outbreak and the possibility of civil unrest. But the theaters reopened in June 1594 and Shakespeare went on to write his most famous plays. Like Will, we’ll get through this.  Connections will be strained in the coming weeks—some of them interpersonal and local, some economic and global. It’s up to us to nourish the connections that are most essential, while finding backups for those that can no longer be relied on. What do we need and value most? How can we support one another? These are the sorts of questions we might ask ourselves in the days ahead—and we may have plenty of time on our hands at home to contemplate them.

Assange has been imprisoned at London’s Belmarsh prison since police dragged out of the embassy a year ago. He is awaiting a May 18 hearing on his extradition to the United States, where he faces espionage charges over the activities of WikiLeaks.  In a video uploaded onto YouTube, Stella Moris said she met Assange in 2011 when she helped out his legal team and that they got together four years later. Moris says their children are 3-year-old Gabriel and 1-year-old Max.  Moris said in a statement last month in support of Assange’s bail application that she had gone “to great lengths to shelter our children from the climate that surrounds him.” Assange respected her wish for privacy, she wrote in the statement dated March 24 and seen by The Associated Press.  “My close relationship with Julian has been the opposite of how he is viewed, of reserve, respect for each other and attempts to shield each other from some of the nightmares that have surrounded our lives together,” she said.  Moris said she decided to make the statement a day after the British government put the country under lockdown, because “our lives are on the brink and I fear that Julian could die.” She worried about the coronavirus taking root in the prison and Assange’s “increased risk of exposure.”  Jennifer Robinson, counsel to Assange and Wikileaks and a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers, said Moris had “not taken this decision lightly, having fiercely protected her family’s privacy for many years.”  “She wanted to speak in support of Julian’s bail application given the grave risk to his health in prison during the COVID pandemic and the judge refused her anonymity.”  The extradition hearing is fixed for May 18 after a judge at Westminster Magistrates’ Court rejected calls for an adjournment until September over what Assange’s legal team said were “insuperable” difficulties preparing his case because of the virus pandemic.

Yep, still counting the hours to the long weekend; gotta have a goal. Suffice it to say, the pace of trading, volatility, macro developments, policy responses, and the outbreak itself resulted in the year-long month of March – at least it felt that way. This week has brought with it a sense of market calm and budding optimism largely lacking in the crisis up to this point. This followed what appears to be a plateau in Covid-19 in parts of Europe and the subsequent extrapolation of the overseas timeline to the domestic outbreak. What remains to be seen is whether the experience in other nations truly translates onshore.  In assessing this question, investors will continue to track the incoming coronavirus stats and gauge the official response. Lockdown life will continue for the time being, even as the macro conversation has shifted to reopening strategies and the prospects of getting back to the new normal.  This is a generation defining episode in world history; an observation which isn’t intended as needless hyperbole. The fact of the matter is that investor and consumer behavior will change in the wake of the current health crisis… for a while.  The reality of emptied college campuses, mothballed air fleets, shuttered car plants, and retail ghost towns will have a dramatic impact on the labor force statistics over the coming months; a massive drain, followed by a reemployment surge. This much is easy enough to envision, if not perfectly forecast. The next major unknown is how the reopening transpires – and of course when.  Trump is reportedly crafting a plan to reopen certain sections of the economy not particularly hard hit by the coronavirus, while keeping areas still struggling with significant cases shuttered; New York is top of mind in this regard. Partial reopenings will be undoubtedly be the unifying theme of the headlines on this topic over the course of the next several sessions and our expectation is that it will be a net positive for risk assets. Before investors can move forward with estimating the cost of the outbreak in economic terms, an end date is required and this has become the market’s newest preoccupation. Our take is there will be an eventual return to pre-virus normality, but the timeline will be measured in quarters, or years – not weeks or months.  This brings us to the current stage of evaluating the leg in Treasury yields. Our base case for this week remains the process of defining the near-term range will extend – although to a large degree there are a several key levels already in place. In 10-year yields there are two trading zones to watch; the narrower at 56.4 bp to 89 bp and the broader at 31.4 bp to 127.3 bp. The tighter range has held since March 23 and there is no reason to anticipate it breaks in the coming weeks. It will take a concrete reopening schedule and significant progress in battling Covid-19 in the US before 1-handle 10s return to the realm of conceivable outcomes.  The very front end of the curve is going to remain in a much narrower and lower range for a very long time – 2s at 25 bp appears to be establishing some semblance of equilibrium. Negative front-end yields are still on our radar in the event of another risk-off impulse from new depths of the economic fallout expectations; the bounce in risk assets has lessened the urgency for the sector at the moment. It’s difficult to envision another liquidity crunch and dash for cash comparable to that seen during March, therefore another repricing to lower rates will be a slow and methodical grind as recovery prospects eventually come into finer focus.

The 34-year-old patient is from Suizhou city in Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus. He travelled from Hubei's capital Wuhan to Lhasa, the provincial capital of Tibet by train from January 22 to 24.  On January 25, he developed symptoms of cough and fever, and later went to the designated medical institution in the region and was hospitalised.  He was confirmed to be infected with the new virus on January 29, becoming the the first and only confirmed case in the region.  \"When I learned that I was a confirmed case, I felt great stress and was very upset. The medical staff gave me meticulous care. I sincerely thank the doctors, nurses and the Tibetan people,\" state-run Xinhua news agency quoted the patient as saying.  \"After receiving treatment, the patient's temperature has returned to normal for 14 days, and two nucleic acid tests had negative results,\" Puncog Zhaxi, president of the Third People's Hospital of Tibet said.  \"In accordance with the country's latest novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment scheme and consultation of an expert team, the patient has met the standard of cured and can be discharged from hospital,\" Puncog Zhaxi said.  As of Tuesday, Tibet has not reported any new or suspected cases or deaths caused by the virus for the 13th consecutive day, the Xinhua report said.  The death toll in China's novel coronavirus outbreak has gone up to 1,113 with 97 new fatalities reported mostly in the worst-affected Hubei province while the confirmed cases of infection jumped to 44,653, health officials said on Wednesday.  The virus was officially named \"COVID-19\" by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on Tuesday.  After naming the virus as \"COVID-19\", WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: \"We had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an individual or group of people, and which is also pronounceable and related to the disease\".  The CO stands for corona, the VI for virus and the D for disease, Ghebreyesus said in Geneva.

Americans have seen scarcity, bailouts, price fluctuations, and epidemics before, but one thing seems to set the coronavirus emergency apart:   The toilet paper.  Shelves where the product once was stored are bare—and not just in the US. The United Kingdom has experienced similar shortages, leading consumers to purchase toilet paper substitutes (at the risk of the sewage system), and an Australian newspaper went so far as to print eight blank pages in a recent issue to be used in case of emergency for, you guessed it, toilet paper.  The desire to hoard during a pandemic may be totally natural, but hoarding for some means scarcity for others.  What is a good solution for this problem? Many stores have instigated their own rationing devices (limits of X amount of toilet paper, hand sanitizers, etc., per customer), with others instituting hours of shopping reserved for the elderly or immunocompromised.  These are creative and compassionate ideas, and they may solve some of the problem of hoarding—but the market has another way.  The problem? It’s incredibly unpopular, and, of course, even illegal in many places.  Understanding the Price Gouging Problem  “Price gouging” has a particularly negative connotation. It refers to a phenomenon wherein customers at an especially vulnerable time are charged unusually high prices by “greedy” business owners taking advantage of their need.  But think about the incentives of business owners—do you know a single entrepreneur, business owner, or honest employee who wants to intentionally upset their customers? The incentive of business owners is always to provide great service and reasonable prices. To act otherwise is to eventually run out of business.  These incentives do not suddenly change during a crisis—business owners are still judged by the court of public opinion, and those who treat customers unfairly will not go unnoticed, at least not for long.  So why do prices rise during times of need? The answer is found in the basic economic principles of supply and demand.  When demand increases, it’s a signal that customers want to consume more of a certain product.  Basic Economics: Supply and Demand  The graph below demonstrates these changes. The demand line shifts up from D1 to D2—increasing prices, but only temporarily. Prices are a rationing device and signal of scarcity, so this higher price naturally encourages customers to make do with less while simultaneously indicating to producers to expand production.  Though buyers have to pay more for each product, it reduces the risk of shortages by making it easier for suppliers to meet the increased demand for their goods. [See chart]  What’s perhaps more relevant to our current situation is that hoarders are indirectly discouraged from hoarding. A higher price makes consumers think twice before buying a cart-full of toilet paper, leaving more product on the shelves and limiting or delaying, perhaps indefinitely, any shortage.  But that’s not all, remember that the higher price is only temporary, since higher prices will spur production.  Sellers see product flying off the shelves and note that they need to ramp up production to meet the growing demand. Potential entrepreneurs also recognize that there may be room for extra business in this particular market, so they start production.  Once supply is able to catch up, the supply line shifts from S1 to S2, and prices normalize once again. [See chart 1 and chart 2]  Sure these are merely graphs, and it is difficult to appropriately convey the nuances of human behavior and the complexity of the economy in a single graph.  However, we’ve already seen these forces at work in the past few weeks. Distilleries have taken note of hand sanitizer shortages and are helping to meet the increased demand by producing their own—some even giving their product away for free. Last week Georgia-Pacific, a toilet paper supplier, increased production capacity by 120 percent.  Amplified production by existing companies, and the entrance of new business into markets, will lower prices to pre-crisis levels.  Referring to rising prices as “price gouging” will not change the economic fact: in a free economy, prices are a vital signal to producers and consumers alike. It’s incredible that a single number can do so much.  This is the miracle inherent in free markets—no solitary, all-knowing authority is dictating the direction of prices or production in a single market (let alone an entire economy). It happens naturally, as if led by an invisible hand.   The Toilet Paper Shortage  So why was there a sudden run on toilet paper? Who knows.  Perhaps in anticipation of long periods of quarantine, shoppers are looking for any necessary household goods to stockpile. One consumer psychologist explained that it could simply be retail therapy; stressed consumers rushing for feelings of security during a pandemic. Others simply blame herd mentality—the idea that if everyone else is hoarding toilet paper, you might as well be too.  The ultimate lesson? Let prices rise and markets do their work. As long as economic freedom exists, ingenuity and innovation will never be in short supply—and neither will toilet paper.   COLUMN BY  Amanda Snell is an analytics associate at FEE.

The two-day summit, the 15th meeting of the forum, brought together leaders of economies that account for about 85 percent of global gross domestic product to discuss the most challenging socioeconomic issues.  Saudi Arabia’s King Salman formally handed over the G20 presidency to Italy, which will chair next year’s leaders’ summit.  Delivering a short speech to mark the occasion, Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said a decision had been taken that the focus of the world’s premier forum for economic cooperation would continue to be “people, planet and prosperity.”  Saudi Arabia's King Salman delivering an address during the second session of the G20 summit, held virtually due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, in Riyadh.

On this basis, we will then support economic recovery, advance women’s empowerment, and address poverty and inequalities, both new and old, so that no one is left behind.”  The G20 will “facilitate energy transition and combat climate change, tap the immense opportunities stemming from digitalization and enhance the multilateral trade system, based on the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and inclusivity, in order to adopt a true and efficient multilateral approach,” he added.  Conte underscored the importance of a joint effort to move to a better future. “The goal would only be attainable if we work together, united as a global community of intentions, cooperation and solidarity,” he said.  “If there is a very clear lesson we have learned in these recent months, it is that no country can win global challenges alone. This pandemic has clearly shown that we cannot do this alone,” he added.  “In today’s world, which is so interconnected and interdependent, multilateralism is not one of the many options — it is the only sustainable option.”  Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte attending the virtual summit. (Twitter photo)  Conte said he is confident that Italy can rely on the support of all G20 member states during its presidency, which will culminate in the 2021 G20 Leaders’ Summit on Oct. 30-31 in his country.  The G20 presidency rotates between member countries. Each presidency typically concludes with the G20 Leaders’ Summit, a powerful gathering of heads of state that made its debut in 2008. Saudi Arabia became the first Arab country to assume the role in December 2019.  The normal G20 calendar was changed due to restrictions put in place across the forum’s membership in response to the coronavirus pandemic.  Leaders and ministers held virtual meetings since March to coordinate the international response to the crisis and put the global economy on a pathway to recovery.  In his closing remarks at the end of the summit in Riyadh, King Salman said G20 countries have succeeded in sending a message of hope and reassurance to their citizens and the global community.  IN NUMBERS $11 TRILLION - Combined G20 support for individuals, businesses during pandemic.  Referring to the final statement, he said: “It is my honor to announce that the G20 members have adopted this communique. This is what the world has been expecting from us. This achievement today is a culmination of our joint efforts throughout this challenge-fraught year.”  He added: “Our joint and individual actions will be critical in overcoming the immediate global challenge we are facing. Looking forward, through empowering people, safeguarding the planet and shaping new frontiers, we will work on laying the foundations to achieve the main theme of our presidency: Realizing opportunities of the 21st century for all.”  King Salman said the G20 countries have upheld their commitment to working together to confront the pandemic and to safeguard lives and livelihoods.  “We have adopted important policies that will achieve recovery all the way to an economy that is resilient, sustainable, inclusive and balanced,” he added.  “These policies will also maintain the momentum to make the global trade system work for all, and create the conditions to achieve sustainable growth.”  King Salman said although it was the first time Saudi Arabia had held the presidency, it was able “to rise to the challenge” amid the pandemic with the support of member countries.  “Due to its unique stature regionally and internationally, interconnecting three continents and lying at the intersection of emerging and developed markets, the Kingdom will continue to play a key role within the G20 to achieve global cooperation and find solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges,” he added.  The summit’s final statement said: “We, the G20 leaders, meeting for the second time under the Saudi presidency, stand united in our conviction that coordinated global action, solidarity, and multilateral cooperation are more necessary today than ever to overcome the current challenges and realize opportunities of the 21st century for all by empowering people, safeguarding the planet, and shaping new frontiers.”  In his closing remarks to the G20 Riyadh summit, King Salman said although it was the first time Saudi Arabia had held the presidency, it was able “to rise to the challenge” amid the pandemic. (Arab News photo by Basheer Saleh)  The G20 leaders also promised to “spare no effort” to ensure the fair distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and medicines worldwide.  “We are taking immediate and exceptional measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic and its intertwined health, social and economic impacts, including through the implementation of unprecedented fiscal, monetary and financial stability actions,” the statement said.  “We recognize the role of extensive immunization as a global public good. We commend the Saudi presidency for initiating discussions on the need for long-term solutions to address gaps in global pandemic preparedness and response.”  Along with tackling the pandemic, the statement called for protecting the planet and continuing to act against climate change.  “Preventing environmental degradation, conserving, sustainably using and restoring biodiversity, preserving our oceans, promoting clean air and clean water, responding to natural disasters and extreme weather events, and tackling climate change are among the most pressing challenges of our time,” the statement said.  During the Saudi presidency of the G20, 170 meetings were conducted involving ministers of finance, trade and investment, health, education, energy, climate, anti-corruption, agriculture, environment, employment, tourism, digital economy, water and foreign affairs.  In addition, civil society and business groups were represented by eight engagement groups: Business 20, Youth 20, Labour 20, Think 20, Civil 20, Women 20, Science 20 and Urban 20.  They held eight summits and issued eight final statements with a view to bringing civil society and private sector views to the policymaking table.   _______________________   Twitter: @LujainBenGassem  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 19, "positive": 50, "negative": 3, "disgust": 1, "joy": 11, "anger": 7, "surprise": 1, "fear": 6, "trust": 8}, "metadata": ["saudi", "arabia", "italy", "global", "minister", "premier", "economic", "cooperation", "coronavirus", "climate", "united", "challenges", "pandemic", "options", "virtual", "crisis", "economy", "commitment", "solutions", "ensure", "medicines", "unprecedented", "promoting", "sector"]}, {"text": "FORT KNOX, Kentucky — The sun never quite managed to break through an overcast morning April 12, but the mood from more than 75 vehicles full of worshipers never seemed to dampen.Honking horns and shouts of hallelujah could be heard in the area around the headquarters of U.S. Army Human Resources Command as motorists arrived from inside the gates of the Central Kentucky post, and outside the gates, to celebrate Easter 2020 in a new way that has become popular in the face of COVID-19: drive-in worship.Soldiers and civilians held signs up asking motorists to stay in their vehicles and tune into FM 100.1 to hear the service while others directed motorists where to park to ensure vehicles remained at least six feet apart. Chaplains and musicians gathered on a road that runs next to Cavalry Chapel, high above the worshipers, leading the unorthodox congregation in music, praise and encouragement.“As you recall the disciples, the men and women who came to meet and follow Jesus, had all experienced a type of portal into a new world,” said Chaplain (Lt. Col.) Thomas Brooks, command chaplain for U.S. Army Cadet Command and keynote speaker. “Their spiritual hopes had been sparked, and their spirits were high; this man came into their lives — the Son of Man, and more than mere man.”Chaplain (Col.) James Boulware, garrison chaplain at the U.S. Army Garrison Fort Knox Religious Support Office, gathered leaders together for prayer prior to the start, where he asked God to hold back the rain. He and others voiced concerns that the weather might discourage people from attending.“Last night, we were looking at up to a 60% chance of rain and 7- or 8-mph winds,” said John Sydnor, worship leader for the service. “That was a big concern for us because our pianist has a baby strapped to her, and my wife has a baby strapped to her.”Boulware said the original idea for a drive-in service came from his daughter, who attends Stithton Baptist Church in nearby Radcliff.“She mentioned that Stithton was going to do a drive-in for their church services, and they had been doing that every Sunday,” said Boulware. “When I heard that, I instantly thought of our Easter service.”Boulware said they had been planning their Easter service for over seven months when disaster struck.“It’s been on the calendar, and then when COVID-19 came along, it got to the point to where we just canceled having the service,” said Boulware. “When I heard this, I thought it would be a great opportunity for us to get as close as possible to celebrating together the resurrection of Jesus Christ.”During initial planning for the drive-in event, religious leaders decided to provide programs and communion as part of the service. Then word came that interaction with worshipers, even in the smallest of ways, could threaten lives.“Two concerns there: Obviously with COVID-19, we’re trying to stay within regulations and use good common sense, so communion cups and programs were a concern. Also, traffic flow – figuring 30 seconds for individuals to get their car windows down and get their communion, roll their windows up and take off, if 50 cars showed up that would require an additional 25 minutes,” said Boulware. “We’re trying to do this as safely as possible without delays.”Besides providing an in-person event for people to worship, leaders also planned to have the service broadcast live on Facebook. Boulware said celebrating a Resurrection Day event is a critical part of Christian faith.“This is central to everything we believe,” said Boulware. “As the Apostle Paul taught, if we’re not being resurrected, what hope do we have in this life? The hope that we have in Christ’s death, burial and resurrection is everything, so to come together as a church, and to celebrate this together is the most exciting time in our Christian faith when it comes to celebrating.”Feedback from those in attendance was overwhelmingly positive, according to leaders. One family in attendance was the Watsons, who live in Radcliff. Jeremy works as a youth pastor.“We enjoyed this; it was well organized, and it was good hearing the actual resurrection put together by different chaplains through scripture,” said Jeremy. “And amid the forecast of rain, the fact that they decided to go ahead and do it was great.”By the time the event started at 7:30, the Watsons and over 65 other cars full of people had arrived with more rolling in. Throughout the service, many tapped their horns in praise, others raised hands out of their windows in worship. The rain never fell.“There have been considerations and difficulties in trying to plan for everything, but you couldn’t ask for much better weather,” said Sydnor after the service. “It’s God’s show, and God showed.”_______________________________________________________________________Editor's Note: For more pictures of the event, go to the official Fort Knox Flickr page here.

Outreach workers in San Diego are calling the city’s plan to bring more than 800 homeless individuals into a temporary shelter in the San Diego Convention Center amid the coronavirus outbreak “a powder keg” that could permit the contagion to rapidly spread among one of the most vulnerable segments of the population.  City officials in San Diego on Wednesday opened the doors of the convention center to 829 homeless people who previously had been staying in shelters, and the city could eventually have up to 1,500 people living there. While living conditions at the center will be less cramped than in shelters, some homeless outreach workers say even one positive case of COVID-19 could wreak havoc on the people staying on the convention center’s floor.  PHOTOS: EMPTY STREETS AMID CORONAVIRUS FEARS IN US CITIES  “Bewildering is just one adjective to use to describe putting a thousand souls in an open congregate shelter like this during a public health crisis,” Chris Megison, the founder of the homeless outreach organization Solutions for Change, told Fox News. “It’s a powder keg in there.”  Megison added: “We are all are hoping and praying that nobody dies, but if somebody does die its involuntary manslaughter as far as we’re concerned because this is irresponsible.”  Video from inside the convention center showed rows of military-style cots spaced about 6 feet apart lining the entire width of the main hall’s floor. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggest that homeless encampments should not be cleared out during the pandemic unless individual housing units are available and that residents of encampments should set up their tents with at least 12 feet of space per individual.  California is home to half of the country’s street homeless population -- about 151,000 people in all -- and state and local lawmakers have already thrown billions of dollars trying to tackle the mounting issue of homelessness. The coronavirus pandemic has created an even greater sense of urgency to get people off the streets, but also out of crowded shelters where the pathogen could easily spread.  “COVID's threat to homeless populations is a serious public health issue and I’m concerned that it is going to have a very devastating effect on the homeless,” Jeffrey Norris, the medical director at Father Joe's Villages, a homeless outreach organization in San Diego, told Fox News.  Norris added: “Many have medical comorbidities -- diabetes, heart disease, chronic lung disease -- that put them at a higher risk. Many elderly folks experience homelessness. Whether they live on the streets or in dense shelters, they have a high prevalence in risk factors.”  CLICK FOR COMPLETE COVERAGE OF THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK  California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced last week that money from the federal government would help pay for at least 15,000 hotel rooms during the pandemic. In Los Angeles and San Francisco, Mayors Eric Garcetti and London Breed, respectively, have both been working to lease hotel rooms for homeless individuals in an effort to give them some literal breathing room and keep the virus at bay  The first hotel opened Friday in Los Angeles and a total of 1,340 beds at 15 sites across the county were expected to be ready by the end of that week with Garcetti saying at least 15,000 would be needed in total. San Francisco committed $35 million to lease 7,000 hotel rooms for the homeless for the next three months.  San Diego County has already secured more than 441 hotel rooms for the homeless as of late March and is currently working to secure more rooms throughout the county. Craig Gustafson, the communications director for the city of San Diego, told Fox News that the city believed the convention center was the best way to keep homeless individuals safe, as well as consolidate homeless services during the crisis.  CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP  Gustafson said the city is following all social distancing guidelines from the CDC and state officials by keeping beds 6 feet apart and making sure that the homeless keep their distance from one another. He added that trained nurses and other staff will be on head 24 hours a day to monitor for anyone showing COVID-19 symptoms.  \"We’re taking all the precautions necessary and following all the recommendations. Our number one priority is keeping people safe,\" he said. \"It's definitely a stop-gap measure in that we saw a problem in our shelters being so crowded and had to do something.\"  Gustafson added: \"We have hotel and motel rooms throughout the county, but county officials are focused on working on that.\"  Megison balks at any use of “open congregate shelters” during the pandemic and argues that with most hotels and businesses closed to the public, there is more than enough space to shelter homeless people individually. He said his organization, which focuses primarily on the northern part of San Diego County, has moved residents in shelters to private housing units that it leased as the outbreak worsened.  “There are gazillions of empty hotel and motel rooms right now just sitting there,” he added. “Why put people in an open congregate shelter, I just don’t understand why the mayor and the county are doing this.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 15, "positive": 26, "negative": 5, "anger": 24, "fear": 9, "trust": 8}, "metadata": ["coronavirus", "san", "convention", "outbreak", "vulnerable", "havoc", "solutions", "fox", "guidelines", "pandemic", "california", "tackle", "populations", "elderly", "hotel", "los", "angeles", "london", "virus", "beds", "sites", "app", "distancing", "cdc", "precautions", "focused", "northern", "mayor"]}, {"text": "The chairman of Tyson Foods warned Sunday that 'the food supply chain' is breaking after coronavirus outbreaks forced the closure of their plants.  John Tyson said 'millions of pounds of meat' will fail to reach stores and there will be a 'limited supply of our products available in grocery stores' until they are able to reopen facilities currently closed.  It comes after it was announced two million chickens will be killed in Delaware and Maryland because of lack of employees at processing plants.  Tyson Foods announced last week that it was shuttering two pork processing plants, including its largest in the United States, to contain the spread of the coronavirus. At least 13 plants in total are said to have closed across the US.  Chairman Tyson said Sunday: 'We have a responsibility to feed our country. It is as essential as healthcare. This is a challenge that should not be ignored. Our plants must remain operational so that we can supply food to our families in America.  'This is a delicate balance because Tyson Foods places team member safety as our top priority.'

Tyson also closed a pork processing facility in Logansport, Indiana, while its more than 2,200 workers at the plant undergo testing for COVID-19.  John Tyson, pictured, has warned that 'the food supply chain' is breaking  The company also temporarily closed a beef processing plant in Pasco, Washington.  The closures are limiting the amount of meat the United States can produce during the outbreak and adding stress on farmers who are losing markets for their pigs.  Lockdowns that aim to stop the spread of the coronavirus have also prevented farmers around the globe from delivering food products to consumers.  Millions of laborers cannot get to fields for harvesting and planting, and there are too few truckers to keep goods moving.  Tyson's statement, in the form of an advert in a number of newspapers on Sunday, came after workers at plants argued they were not being protected by their employer.  Employers have struggled to contain the virus in meatpacking plants, where workers toil side by side on production lines and often share crowded locker rooms, cafeterias and rides to work.  One Tyson worker at the plant in Waterloo told CNN he called HR amid concerns coronavirus was at the facility.  Ernest Latiker said: 'I was scared for me and my family. They told me I was safe and they told me that everything was ok.  'They told me I have a better chance of catching the coronavirus going out to Walmart than at Tyson, if you come to work you're safe.  'I wanted to believe to them and I needed the money at the same time so I went to work.'  Plant employees tested positive for the virus, and others stayed home out of fear of becoming infected. The facility slaughters about 19,500 hogs a day, or about 5 per cent of total U.S. pork production, according to industry data.  Tyson Foods worker Ernest Latiker, pictured, said he called HR amid coronavirus concerns  Tyson's statement in the form of an advert in a number of newspapers on Sunday came after workers at plants argued they were not being protected by their employer  Spread of coronavirus closes meat plants Some of the facilities that have shut or reduced production as coronavirus spreads: JBS USA said it would indefinitely close a pork plant in Worthington, Minnesota, that processes 20,000 hogs a day. JBS closed a beef plant in Greeley, Colorado, until April 24. Smithfield Foods indefinitely shut a Sioux Falls, South Dakota, plant that produces about 4% to 5% of U.S. pork. Smithfield also shuttered two plants in Wisconsin and Missouri that process bacon and ham. Tyson Foods Inc closed a hog slaughterhouse in Columbus Junction, Iowa. It has since reopened National Beef Packing Co suspended cattle slaughtering at an Iowa Premium beef plant in Tama, Iowa National Beef said it suspended operations at a Dodge City, Kansas, beef plant for cleaning and to install stainless steel partitions Aurora Packing Company temporarily closed a beef plant in Aurora, Illinois JBS shut a beef plant in Souderton, Pennsylvania.

Advertisement  'Consumers will see an impact at the grocery store as production slows,' Tyson Fresh Meats Group President Steve Stouffer had said last week.  'It means the loss of a vital market outlet for farmers and further contributes to the disruption of the nation's pork supply.'  After the closure of the Logansport facility, slaughterhouses that account for 19 per cent of pork production in the United States will be shut.  And coronavirus-related staffing shortages at chicken processing plants will lead farms in Maryland and Delaware to destroy nearly two million chickens.  The Baltimore Sun reported Friday that the plants are unable to keep pace with the number of birds that are ready for harvest. They had been placed into poultry houses as chicks several weeks ago.  The chickens will not be processed for meat.  The trade group the Delmarva Poultry Industry said that every poultry plant on the Delmarva Peninsula has struggled with a reduced worker attendance. The reasons include workers being sick with the coronavirus and people following guidance to stay home if sick.  The Delmarva Peninsula includes parts of Delaware, Maryland and Virginia.  The trade group said that one unidentified company has become the first to do what's called 'depopulation.' The trade group said the company was unable to find other options, such as allowing another company to take the chickens.  Delmarva Poultry Industry Inc said the chickens will killed 'using approved, humane methods'.  The former Chief Veterinary Officer for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, John Clifford, said at the time of avian flu 'the fastest way and probably the most humane way to take care of this' was to 'shut off ventilation systems.'  The trade group said that the extermination methods have been approved by the American Veterinary Medical Association for handling cases of infectious avian disease.  Brazilian-owned JBS USA and WH Group's Smithfield Foods have also each indefinitely closed massive pork plants in Minnesota and South Dakota, respectively.  Reduced meat output comes as demand has increased at grocery stores, while restaurant dining rooms are closed due to the virus.  Tyson said 2,800 workers at the Iowa plant would be compensated during the closure and invited to the facility later this week for coronavirus testing.  There are more than a million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States as of Monday. The death toll has reached 56,038.  As Tyson becomes the third large pork processing plant to close following a coronavirus outbreak, there are fears about a break in the food supply and a shortage of fresh meat. Pictured is an empty chicken and poultry food case in New Jersey on March 13  Smithfield Foods plant in South Dakota could reopen 'in a matter of days' South Dakota's governor on Monday said she hopes Smithfield's Sioux Falls pork processing plant can reopen soon, a day after U.S. labor regulators urged the meat industry to adopt certain measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus among workers. 'I'm hopeful that we can get it opened as soon as possible,' Kristi Noem told Fox News Channel in an interview. 'They have some mitigation measures to put in place, but I think in a matter of days it could be opened, as long as everybody continues to work together and get it done.' Smithfield Foods, the world's biggest pork processor, has shut down several U.S. plants due to a rash of coronavirus cases among employees, raising concerns about the nation's meat supply and worker safety. Its cases in Sioux Falls triggered a so-called hot spot of U.S. coronavirus cases. Noem, a Republican, was among the few governors who did not issue stay-at-home orders. On Sunday, the U.S. Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued new interim guidelines with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that call for meat industry workers to be at least 6 feet apart, have their temperatures checked and wear face masks. Advertisement  The outcome of the tests and other factors will determine when the facility will reopen, according to the company.  Other U.S. meat and poultry plants are operating at reduced capacity. Tyson is running a pork plant in Columbus Junction, Iowa, with limited operations after idling it for two weeks.  Iowa farmer Randy Francis delivers 300 pigs to 500 pigs a week to the Waterloo plant for slaughter that are backing up in his barns. He hopes to truck the animals to other plants, but they are already overloaded with other hogs displaced by the shutdowns.  The pigs will put on more weight than normal due to the delays, Francis said. That could make their meat fattier or tougher to chew when they are eventually slaughtered, he said.  'It's definitely scary times,' Francis said.

Kirklees’s director of public health confirmed schools would work with families who were concerned about coronavirus.  Rachel Spencer-Henshall also stressed pupils’ attendance would not be affected, nor would parents face fines, should children need to self-isolate.  The announcement came as the Holmfirth parents of a one-year-old baby born prematurely at 23 weeks suffering long-term lung problems, made the bold decision to stop sending his older brother to school in case he contracts coronavirus.  Little Sean Junior Johnson-Crouch weighed just 1lb 5oz when he was delivered 17 weeks prematurely at the roadside by paramedics on the way to Barnsley Hospital.  The poorly tot spent four months in the neo natal unit at Sheffield Children’s Hospital where his parents Sean Johnson and Natasha Crouch were told to expect the worse.  But despite all odds, the tiny fighter whose lungs had not fully developed was allowed home in time for his March 2019 due date, needing round-the-clock care including oxygen.  Now, his family have taken the decision to keep his older brother Shakur, age nine, home from school after growing increasingly worried about the spread of COVID-19 to their vulnerable baby.  Dad Sean said: “I am worried and feel so anxious, I have hardly slept.  “Sean Junior has got severe lung problems and a weakened immune system down to being so premature. He still needs to be on oxygen all night and only came off it during the day three days ago.  “I don’t feel Boris Johnson is sending a clear message out if you’re dealing with looking after vulnerable children.  “We’re in a sticky situation because this could potentially kill him.  “I really don’t care about getting a fine. I will contest it, even if it means having to get a solicitor. My baby son’s health is more important.”  His comments came after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the UK would not be closing schools or banning public events, in line with other European countries, after the government’s Cobra meeting yesterday.  Mr Johnson admitted the country was facing “the worst public health crisis for a generation” which could see many families “lose loved ones before their time”.  But he said the government would “do the right thing at the right time” and urged those suffering symptoms of a fever or cough to self-isolate for seven days.  Sean believes the measures did not go far enough to adequately protect those with existing health conditions.  He said: “His response to it is no good, you just need to look at other countries who have done the right thing to stop this spreading.  “Boris is basically just saying remember to sing Happy Birthday whilst washing your hands and good luck.  “They are not even thinking about people who have vulnerable children to look after, or people living in homes with elderly grandparents.  “How does that stop them getting infected, when the kids are still going to school, if someone at school has got it?  “When these schools have assemblies they are all sat in one room. It scares the ***t out of me to be honest.  “We are doing this to save our son from going through it.”  He said the school, which he did not wish to name, had been understanding and they were now in talks with the headteacher.  Sean added: “I want school to work around it with us. They know he has health issues and that this could have a bad effect on him. I would like them to send some work for him to do at home.”  Rachel Spencer-Henshall, Director of Public Health for Kirklees, said: “I completely sympathise with parents and understand that everyone’s circumstances are not the same.  “The health of our residents is the absolute priority. If parents need to take their children out of school for coronavirus-related reasons, this will not have an impact on their school attendance record. Parents will not be fined for this.  “Schools will work with parents to make sure their children can continue with their learning if they do need to self-isolate.  “I would advise people to rely only on official information for updates, help and advice.

The reason for this is simple – gases, vapors and particles in the air will take the path of least resistance and bypass the part of the respirator that captures or filters hazards out.”  Twitter users were delighted by the graphic, but facial hair or not, wearing an every day surgical mask may not keep you 100 percent protected from airborne illnesses such as COVID-19.  “Surgical masks will not prevent your acquiring diseases,” Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventative medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University, and the medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, previously told Fox News.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)  When President Trump announced Wednesday he was considering using an obscure Constitutional provision to adjourn Congress so he could make recess appointments he felt necessary to help address the current COVID-19 crisis, I couldn’t help but wonder if Trump’s true aim with that political arrow was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s heart as she sat unsuspecting in her California kitchen, enjoying expensive ice cream far away from Washington DC.  Because while Trump’s frustration sounded like it was a result of Senate inaction on appointments (and it likely was to a degree), the subtext appeared (to me anyway) to be one of high annoyance that the Speaker — and even the entire Democrat caucus — was basically laying out of work (possibly with plans to continue the behavior past the President’s May 1st date) while the country suffered through a pandemic. In fact, Pelosi and Company have already held up an influx of new money intended to help small businesses weather the economic downturn, leading to this tweet from Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz:  “A good offer”?!? How about you fund the damn program Nancy and stop playing games with people’s livelihood. https://t.co/iLgzPtLLrr — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) April 16, 2020  It looks very much like Pelosi is doing just that: playing the obstructionist game while munching on bougie ice-cream and pushing to extend her time off from working for the American people that elected her. But Trump’s Wednesday announcement about using presidential powers given him in the Constitution — which he can certainly wield so long as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell helps him — will definitely have the Speaker rethinking some things.  Because it sets up a choice for Nancy: lay out of work except to stall passage of economic stimulus programs and accept recess appointments that will likely end up politically disastrous for her, or get back to work to stop that adjournment (and do all the other things legislators are expected to do to keep the country running under these extreme circumstances).  There’s not much doubt that Trump feels Nancy’s been derelict long enough. This was from Thursday morning:  Crazy “Nancy Pelosi, you are a weak person. You are a poor leader. You are the reason America hates career politicians, like yourself.” @seanhannity She is totally incompetent & controlled by the Radical Left, a weak and pathetic puppet. Come back to Washington and do your job! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 16, 2020  And there’s plenty of evidence Democrats mean to do everything they can to keep the country closed longer than Trump would like.  The political battle over opening the country has officially begun. Pelosi is a formidable politician. But using the presidential powers enumerated in the Constitution was nothing short of brilliant.   My money’s on Trump.

The CDC said schools and workplaces may need to start planning, just in case, looking into how to operate if schools close or people need to work from home.  At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, health officials said right now, school districts in Wisconsin should be connecting with their local health departments to develop plans.  \"Our local health departments have been planning like we have for many years, decades for a pandemic of influenza,\" said Chuck Warzecha, director of the division of public health with DHS. \"Every community has their own roles and partners and players involved in that planning. It's really a matter of picking up those exercises and plans that they've been working on and putting them into place, so the main piece of information to share is making sure that communication is happening. It's not too soon for it to be happening now.\"  Health experts say remote classroom learning has been used in the past and could be a solution if there's an outbreak here.  The state Department of Public Instruction reached out to school districts Wednesday, encouraging them to update their plans in case of a pandemic. A spokesperson says the agency is offering guidance on strategies for response and for communications with staff and parents.  Some districts have already sent out tips on how to stay healthy, amid the worldwide outbreak.  DHS is currently reviewing the state's plans for an influenza pandemic, to adapt it as needed for a possible coronavirus pandemic.  State health officials say as of now, national travel restrictions and local efforts to identify possible cases quickly and isolate the patients appear to have helped stop the spread and avoid an outbreak in the US. A patient in Madison was confirmed to have the illness earlier this month.  The threat of getting coronavirus, also known now as COVID-19, is low in Wisconsin and the US, but the focus of concern is anyone traveling to areas where the illness is actively spreading, according to DHS.  Health officials say you still have a better chance of getting the flu right now than coronavirus. They ask everyone to get their flu shot, to stay healthy and avoid burdening the healthcare system right now.  The state is working with federal authorities on supplies of essential healthcare equipment like masks and respirators, determining how to conserve or find alternative resources for medical providers.  The state does have plans in case of a possible quarantine, based off experience with isolating tuberculosis.

Gretchen Whitmer's executive order on Monday.  The state mandate is meant to limit the spread of COVID-19. As of Wednesday, there were 2,295 confirmed cases of the virus in Michigan, and 43 deaths.  Whitmer's stay-at-home order suspends activities statewide that are \"not necessary to sustain or protect life.\" This means employers are not able to call non-essential employees into work; although, there are a lot of operations listed in the executive order that are allowed to maintain operations at least on a limited basis.  Many of the employers Lakeshore Advantage works with will meet the guidelines for offering an essential service, Emily Staley told The Sentinel in an email, who serves as the vice president, marketing and communications with Lakeshore Advantage.  “In our region, we make controls for hospital beds, furniture for hospitals, infant formula and food,” Staley said via email on Monday. “Companies are being encouraged to go through their list of suppliers to also certify them as essential if need be, so that the essential employers can keep producing their essential products. We have been reaching out to our primary employers, seeing how we can help.”  Some companies are running at limited capacity. For instance, Holland Township-based Metal Flow Corp. confirmed with The Sentinel that the metal stamping company is part of the critical manufacturing sector serving the transportation industry, according to an employee.  Elsewhere in the state, Ford announced it’s working with 3M and General Electric to make the kinds of ventilators and masks that are currently in short supply as the world battles the novel coronavirus pandemic. The company joins other carmakers like Tesla and General Motors in helping out the medical community, after idling their automotive plants due to the effects the pandemic is having on both consumer demand and the global supply chain.  To support U.S. health care workers, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles plans to build masks at a Chinese facility and donate them to health care workers on the frontlines — 1 million of them per month.  Closer to home, manufacturers are doing what they can to help their employees as plants are closed.  Herman Miller and Haworth both sent The Sentinel statements about compensation for their employees in wake of the executive order.  \"We are paying all employees through this scheduled work week and working through the complex compensation and salary options for the next few weeks,\" said Haworth's public relations manager, Julie Smith, in an email. \"Haworth previously extended a special supplemental paid leave and time off programs for employees who are impacted by the disease.\"  Manufacturing has \"idled\" at Haworth following the governor's order, and office staff have been working from home, Smith said.  Herman Miller has also committed to paying its Michigan-based employees. The company is evaluating its facilities and workforce at each of its locations due to different regulations across state lines.  \"... Herman Miller will be paying our Michigan-based operations and maintenance teams most affected by the shut down two weeks of wages, one week of paid vacation and continue with full benefits,\" the statement reads. \"Workers in Michigan who previously opted for voluntary lay-offs will also be covered by this decision.\"  We are grateful to all our employees for their dedication, and we will continue to monitor this dynamic situation with both our employees’ and company’s health top of mind.”  — Contact reporter Kate Carlson at kcarlson@hollandsentinel.com and follow her on Twitter @SentienlKate and @BizHolland.

I have followed that model and its predictions for a while, and have concluded that it is more or less useless, for the following reasons.  First, the IHME model abdicates just where policymakers–i.e., governors–need information. The model has projected deaths, along with demand for hospital beds and ICU rooms, up to August 4, 2020. This is a typical chart you will find on the IHME web site:  Further, the model’s web site has said, with respect to each U.S. state, “Social distancing assumed until infections minimized and containment implemented.” Presumably the IHME modelers think that social distancing makes a difference. In each state, they show new deaths leveling off to around zero well before August 4.  But what happens when the current lockdowns end? That is what governors really need to know. It seems obvious that, if one assumes the lockdowns have slowed the spread of the virus, when the lockdowns are eased the virus will again spread more rapidly. And, as a result, more people will get sick and more will die. Governors understand this, while most in the general public don’t, naively believing that lockdowns will end when it is “safe” for us to emerge from our homes.  On the key decision that confronts policymakers, the IHME model resolutely refuses to give any guidance. Does it matter whether the lockdowns end tomorrow, or continue for another three months? And what increase in infections should people be prepared to expect when our economic and social life resumes? The IHME model is silent.  But this makes no sense. If the model “assumes social distancing,” it must incorporate a mathematical calculation that is different from what it would be in the absence of social distancing. Nevertheless, the modelers decline to explain their logic or to enlighten policymakers.  Second, the IHME model, when examined on a state by state basis, produces results so whimsical that a governor would be foolish to rely on them. I have written about this before, most recently in Coronavirus In Five States (3). I have followed the model’s predictions with regard to the five states of the Upper Midwest, but I am sure that you would see similarly unhelpful results if you looked closely at other states. Here are the fatality totals that the IHME model has predicted at various times for four of the Upper Midwestern states:   Minnesota   April 11: 442   April 15: 656   April 22: 360   April 29: 741  The IHME projection for Minnesota was cut by nearly 50% between April 15 and April 22, then more than doubled in the next week, April 22 to April 29. Why? Not because of any such wild fluctuations in Minnesota’s statistics. At any time during the past month, our governor would have been foolish to base any decision on IHME’s projections.   Iowa   April 11: 743   April 15: 618   April 22: 365   April 29: 302  The IHME model was grotesquely wrong about Iowa, and has been adjusted repeatedly to bring it more in line with reality. At least it is getting closer: according to IHME, Iowa had 136 deaths as of April 28. Any action Iowa’s governor might have taken in early April, relying on the IHME model, would have been misguided.   North Dakota   April 11: 369   April 15: 32   April 22: 356   April 29: 136  Little need be said about these wild gyrations. They apparently result from changes in the IHME model, not from anything actually happening in North Dakota. Total number of COVID-19 deaths as of April 28, per the IHME? 19. The governor of North Dakota and his public health officials would have been crazy to pay any heed to the IHME model, at any time.   South Dakota  South Dakota is an interesting case. These are IHME’s predictions of South Dakota fatalities through August 4, on the following dates:   April 11: 356   April 15: 181   April 22: 93  Again, IHME was dead wrong. Its South Dakota projection has now dropped all the way down to 17, but that projection only runs through May 7, next Thursday. Why? Apparently because South Dakota’s governor, Kristi Noem, has declined to order a shutdown. IHME says:  Long-term projections are unavailable for this location. Our model does not account for easing social distancing or quantify the risk of resurgence.  But then, what good is it? This is the point I made earlier.  In any event, South Dakota’s governor would have been badly misled if she had relied on the IHME model a month ago. They were wrong and she was right, and the modelers have drastically reduced their projection to approach nearer to the reality on the ground.  South Dakota appears to be one of only a few states–Tennessee and Alaska are the others I have noted–for which IHME disdains to make a prediction beyond next week, apparently on the ground that those states have eased social distancing requirements (or, in South Dakota’s case, never mandated most of them). Still, inconsistencies abound. North Dakota, like South Dakota, has implemented two of IHME’s six measures of social distancing. Yet, if you go to IHME’s North Dakota page, the modelers continue to project deaths through August 4, and there is no disclaimer as to “[l]ong-term projections [being] unavailable for this location.” What is the difference?  I will leave it to others to speculate. In any event, for the reasons stated, I think the IHME model is more or less completely useless.

Fitzsimmons, who has two adult daughters, Lauren and Sarah, with his wife Lisa, is now taking on a new role after making the 'absolutely difficult and deeply personal' decision to step down from the RFS.  Bushfire hero Shane Fitzsimmons will be honoured as he steps down from his role as New South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner after 12 years on the job  RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons pinning a medal on Harvey Keaton after his father Geoffrey Keaton was posthumously awarded with the Commissioners Commendation for Extraordinary Service and a Commendation for Bravery  He will head up Resilience NSW, a new agency announced by Premier Gladys Berejiklian in March, established to ensure the state was prepared and able to respond to crises.  The 51-year-old was widely praised for his leadership during the summer bushfires in which 5.5 million hectares of land was burned and 2,448 homes were razed in NSW.  He led a group of 70,000 volunteer firefighters with, at the height of the bushfires, about 2,500 firefighters working each shift to battles the flames.  Fitzsimmons also led tributes on numerous occasions to the 25 people who were killed in the blazes.  He said the decision to step down as commissioner and move on to a new role was 'absolutely difficult and deeply personal, but it's the right one'.  'It's been a privilege and an absolute honour to have served in this organisation alongside so many tens of thousands of wonderful individuals, and in particular a privilege to lead the organisation as commissioner for over a decade,' Mr Fitzsimmons said when he was announced as the new agency's new chief.  'I've seen very much this past season - the worst that mother nature can deliver - but I also saw the very best in our people.'  Mr Fitzsimmons said drought-stricken communities had been 'belted by bushfires' only for the extraordinary COVID-19 pandemic to then compound the situation further.  'I very much care about and am concerned for the people of NSW ... and there is no doubt in my mind that I take on this new role with a deal of trepidation of course,' he said.  'But I'm very open to the idea of continuing to make a meaningful difference in the lives and livelihoods of people, of communities, to help with business, to help with industry, and to help rebuild our economy.'  Mr Fitzsimmons and his wife Lisa (left) and daughter Sarah (centre)  Mr Fitzsimmons followed in his father George's footsteps. Pictured: George's plaque erected after his death during a hazard-reduction burn gone wrong in 2000 in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park  Mr Fitzsimmons joined the RFS in 1985 as a volunteer at just 15-years-old and held a number of senior roles until his appointment as commissioner in 2008.  His determination in the role was forged through personal tragedy after his father George, also a firefighter, was killed in an out-of-control hazard reduction burn in the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park aged just 53.  Four National Parks and Wildlife Service officers also died in the incident and three more were injured.  The incident strengthened his resolve to ensure safety and logistics were paramount for those battling fires on the front lines.  'I have never found someone who is able to be as supportive to people in need as much as Shane,' deputy commissioner Rob Rogers said.  Rogers will take over the role of NSW RFS commissioner, after 40 years as a member and nine years as deputy.  NSW RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons with his daughters Lauren (left) and Sarah (right)  Emergency Services Minister David Elliott also echoed the comments.  'I don't think there's a single person who would disagree that Commissioner Fitzsimmons' leadership was a beacon of hope during our State's darkest hour,' Mr Elliott said.  Resilience NSW will lead a whole-of-government prevention, preparedness and recovery efforts, and oversee emergency management policy, service delivery and all aspects of disaster recovery.  'Who would have thought that in 2020, NSW would be facing a pandemic. We don't know the challenges of the future but what I do know is that NSW, through Resilience NSW, will be able to focus on preparing and recovering from anything that comes our way,' Ms Berejiklian said.

We don’t get appreciation. We don’t get one week off like every other department. We’re just left out there like, ‘Oh if you die you die.’”  After taking the weekend to mourn his sibling’s death, Wong was back at work driving the E train Tuesday morning — where the cancer survivor has risked his own health through the pandemic by ferrying front-line workers to their jobs while dealing with dirty trains, homeless crowds and panicked customers.  Five days a week, Wong reports to work at 5:06 a.m. to drive trains back and forth between the World Trade Center and Parson Boulevard in Queens.  Before pulling out of the terminal, he uses a homemade cleaning concoction to spray down his operator’s cab. When the train isn’t too crowded, he cleans the train car as well.  “You have to be fearful. It’s obvious [the virus] is there, so you just want to have some preventative measures for yourself and for the passengers,” he said.  “If there’s not too many people [in the train car], I spray it. Sometimes when there’s people there I ask them, and they say yes.”  The E line was a hotspot for itinerants even before the pandemic, and homelessness is on Wong’s mind the moment he steps aboard the train for his shift.  By that time, the 10-car train already has 50 or 60 people sleeping on it, Wong said. He suspects they’ve been there since midnight.  Subways are some of the last remaining spaces the homeless can find refuge outside of shelters — which have had their own COVID-19 outbreaks — but he says the situation is making other straphangers nervous.  “If you have homeless people in there and they have [coronavirus], and you’re not kicking them out of the system, then [the disease] is almost a permanent fixture. It’s not going anywhere,” he said.  “There was this poor lady who was crying to me. She was a paying passenger and she couldn’t get a seat and she couldn’t go in any of the cars. I said ‘I’m sorry ma’am there’s nothing we can do.’ The best thing I could do was spray the car.”  The high concentration of homeless people on certain cars can create dangerous crowding on others.  Wong said dangerously large crowds on the subways pop up, then disappear — usually before the cops arrive to intervene.  “By the time police are there, the traffic has already left. They’re already gone. They’re packed in there, in my car,” he said.  Dozens of transit workers have died from coronavirus, and thousands more have contracted the disease, despite the MTA’s push to increase the amount of cleaning across the system.  In response to worker health concerns, the agency has started distributing masks, gloves and cleaning materials, and has now begun to install plexiglass barriers in some work locations.  Wong himself only recently wrapped up radiation treatment for cancer in February. But he continued to show up to work day after day in March, even as many of his coworkers called out sick.  A former accountant who took a job in transit so he could stay in Queens to take care for his 97-year-old mother, Wong said he never once considered playing hooky.  “I’m just brought up this way. You go do what you got to do,” he said. “You see people getting on, you can tell by their uniforms that they’re home health aides. These people need to get where they need to go. I would never disingenuously just book off.”  “I don’t consider myself a hero. Just taking people to work.”  Do you have a nominee for The Post’s Hero of the Day? E-mail heroes@nypost.com.

It was early in March, COVID-19 fears were on the rise, and two Kentucky parents who were new to the state needed to open up a bank account. Seeing no other option, they took their seven kids to the bank with them.  By the time they had returned home from their errand, a child protective services caseworker and a law enforcement officer were waiting at the door to investigate them for child abuse.  That's according to Jim Mason of the Home School Legal Defense Association, who blames the false report on panic over COVID-19 social distancing rules. A letter from child services, obtained by Reason confirmed the existence of the complaint.  The parents, referred to as \"Bill and Kristy,\" are homeschoolers. Kristy had moved to Kentucky in advance of Bill, who had remained in New York City finishing up work. When they arrived at the bank, the parents opted to let the two oldest children wait in the car. The other five had to accompany them into the building, which had a COVID-19 warning sign on the door. They were not treated warmly, writes Mason:  The teller immediately interrogated Bill and Kristy about why they had brought five kids into the bank at one time. She [the teller] told them they could not get within six feet of her and that they needed to take the children out. Kristy explained that the children were too young to be left unsupervised by an adult, and neither she nor Bill could take them elsewhere because the couple were opening a joint account, and both had to be present. While Bill stayed with the children away from the counter, Kristy opened the account, feeling self-conscious as the staff whispered to each other and watched her family suspiciously. When Bill walked to the counter to show his New York ID and to sign, the bank staff asked why Bill's and Kristy's identifications were from different states, which the couple explained.  Back at home, the authorities confronted Bill and Kristy, who discovered that someone had called in an anonymous tip claiming that a mother of five had taken her children out with a man who wasn't their dad, and they had bruises on their arms that indicated rough grabbing.  The investigator proceeded to question the kids away from the parents, and he made at least one of the boys take off his shirt to look for bruises. Kristy told Mason that the investigator wanted to do the same with the girls, but she objected, so he only pulled up the girls' sleeves and took photos.  Already, there's a problem: If the kids were wearing long sleeves (it was a cold day), how had anyone spotted bruises? Of course, the caller got other information wrong, too: Bill was very much the kids' father.  The parents presume the call came from someone inside the bank, since it specified five kids rather than seven. Whoever the caller was, they provided the exact kind of information—bruising, suspicion persons, etc.—that prompts a CPS investigation.  When Bill handed over his license, the investigator could see from his last name he was not an \"unrelated male.\" And when the kids showed him their arms, he could see the bruises didn't exist. Case closed? If only.  When I spoke with Mason by phone, he explained the idea of an \"off ramp.\" In theory, he said, once an investigator gets to a home, checks for the supposed crime and comes up empty handed, he or she should turn around and leave—i.e., take the off ramp. Anything else \"is such a terrible thing and a waste of time.\"  But all too often, investigators insist that they must robotically keep probing: opening cabinets, looking in the fridge, questioning kids. This Kentucky investigator even questioned the family about which homeschool curriculum they were using, as if that had some bearing on the case.  That's why the Home School Legal Defense Association, as well as its allies who make up United Family Advocates, have been trying to get \"Off Ramp\" legislation passed. Once an investigation comes up empty-handed, the investigator should simply leave rather than get started checking off a giant list of possible problems.  The groups are also hoping that some day the states will outlaw anonymous reporting. That way it would be harder for people to weaponize the system against families that got on their nerves. Currently, it's just far too easy to bring a case into existence.  What's more, parents in Kentucky—and the rest of the country—also deserve a law like Utah's Free-Range Parenting Bill, which says that simply taking your eyes off your kids is not neglect. Neglect is blatant disregard for their safety. Especially in these times, parents who want their kids to wait in the car or even at home, rather than dragging them into stores, should be able to make that sensible decision without fearing an investigation—or worse.  The HSLDA's lawyers are working with the family. But the state gets 45 days to close an investigation, and Mason said it can easily get an extension, turning a time already tense with pandemic fears into a protracted period of torment.

Delay or defer quarterly federal tax payments in 2020. The administration later announced the tax deadline is moving to July 15.  Expand or extend expensing for equipment and machinery.

The supplier group asked congressional leaders to create a \"Manufacturing Emergency Assistance\" grant program \"to keep the doors open, preserve jobs, and prevent bankruptcies in the vital manufacturing sector.\"  The grants could offset the costs of medical testing, the group said. The group also called for subsidies to relocate operations to the United States.

Especially Ricochet the Surf Therapy Dog who has over 90,000 followers on Instagram and uses her platform to serve others. COVID-19 health orders are now forcing her to get creative with how she helps.  “It’s a big adjustment, she misses the interaction with people quite a bit,” says Judy Fridono, Ricochet’s owner. “It started out with the virtual canine therapy that we do with Pawsitive Teams, the organization that Ricochet is certified through, and I thought well maybe we can do that online somehow.”  Ricochet has over a decade of experience working with children who have special needs, people with disabilities, wounded warriors and veterans with PTSD as an assistive aid.  Fridono says she began brainstorming how she could find a way to reach those on the front lines of the pandemic along with children who are having to stay home because of health orders.  “It kind of grew to doing FaceTime, zoom sessions and then we started working with doctors and nurses on the front lines that are working with COVID-19 patients,” Fridono said. “So we help them relax and unwind.”  Fridono began to see many similarities in war to the trauma and grief that doctor’s and nurses are living through every day on the front lines of a pandemic that’s claiming lives and redefining our world as we know it.  “I think it’s really really important because just last week there was a doctor who took her own life because she was treating so many patients with COVID-19, she got it herself. I thought, it would be the same as the veterans and service members who come back from war with PTSD,” Fridono said. “I really think these doctors and nurses will as well, so I really wanted to do something proactive so that we can try and give them some kind of comfort as everything happening.”  Ricochet also works with young students, giving parents an alternative to have some fun if they run out of things to do during the day.

The first death of a Ruby Princess passenger overseas was confirmed this afternoon, after a Californian man died from coronavirus complications after travelling on the ship.  According to the ABC, Steven Lazarus, 76, developed symptoms on his return to the United States, and was on a ventilator for two weeks before he died April 9.

Picture: Simon Bullard/The Australian   WHAT WE KNOW  It will be at least another four weeks before Australians could start seeing tough virus restrictions eased, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison saying there were three crucial steps the country needed to take before that could happen.  This includes expanding our testing regimen, increasing contact tracing abilities and ramping up local response capabilities.  The PM said if Australia is going to “move to an environment with fewer restrictions then you need these three things in place”.  This announcement came after a National Cabinet meeting today, with Mr Morrison also revealing seven principles in relation to schools during the COVID-19 pandemic.  He said there were “very helpful instructions and advice from the medical expert panel for schools” that dealt principally with the safety of teachers and other staff.  It appears there is one grocery staple Aussies are still rushing out to buy just as supermarket stock levels start to slowly return to normal.  Flour is now harder to get your hands on than a packet of toilet paper in many stores across the country.  Meanwhile, a new mapping tool has revealed areas where no COVID-19 cases have been recorded in NSW, which may indicate where restrictions might start to be lifted first.  The interactive map from the University of Sydney was developed using NSW Health and Australian Bureau of Statistics data, with hopes it will soon be rolled out to other states.   WHAT WE DON’T KNOW  While we know it will be at least four months before the government considers easing coronavirus restrictions in Australia, a new study has found social distancing measures could be in place for a lot longer than expected.  Scientists from Harvard University published new projections in the journal Science, predicting that social distancing measures already in place could be extended well beyond the end of the year — and, if no coronavirus vaccine is discovered, “intermittent periods of social distancing” could be required until 2022, or at the latest, even 2025.  They wrote that different scenarios could see the initial wave of infections end only for new waves to follow behind them.  Social distancing measures could be in place until 2021. Picture: Jeremy Piper  “During the initial pandemic wave, many countries have adopted social distancing measures, and some, like China, are gradually lifting them after achieving adequate control of transmission,” the authors wrote.  “However, to mitigate the possibility of resurgences of infection, prolonged or intermittent periods of social distancing may be required.”  The authors wrote that transmission of the virus could “resemble that of pandemic influenza” where it circulates seasonally.  “The pandemic and post-pandemic transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 will depend on factors including the degree of seasonal variation in transmission, the duration of immunity, and the degree of cross-immunity between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, as well as the intensity and timing of control measures.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 13, "positive": 17, "negative": 3, "disgust": 2, "joy": 2, "anger": 2, "fear": 5, "trust": 2}, "metadata": ["coronavirus", "toll", "princess", "australia", "northern", "complications", "symptoms", "united", "deaths", "linked", "updates", "cruise", "australians", "virus", "minister", "tracing", "university", "easing", "distancing", "projections", "vaccine", "pandemic", "mitigate", "transmission", "duration", "timing"]}, {"text": "Transcript of Press Briefing by Kristalina Georgieva following a Conference Call of the International Monetary and Financial Committee  Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director, IMF  Gerry Rice, Director, Communications Department, IMF  Gerry Rice I'm delighted to have you with us this morning director of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, who has just completed a conference call with the International Monetary and Financial Committee, which is the governing body of the IMF. You may already have seen the statement from Kristalina and the chairman of the IMFC, which was sent to you earlier. I think you understand we're doing the press conference this morning a little bit differently. You all know the circumstances we're facing. I mean, we really appreciate your patience. Thank you for that. And thanks to all of you who sent so many questions in advance. We'll get to as many as we can. And for those of you who wish to send a question online, we'll try and get to those as well. So with no further ado, I want to turn to Kristalina Georgieva who will make some opening remarks and then we'll turn to your questions. Thank you, Kristalina.  Kristalina Georgieva Thank you all very much for joining us. Gerry just said the governing body of the IMF, the International Monetary and Financial Committee, representing our 189 members met today virtually to discuss the unprecedented challenge posed to the world by Covid -19. Following yesterday's G20 leaders meeting, the IMFC took stock of the rapidly developing health crisis, its impact on the economy, measures taken to address this impact and how well the fund is equipped to help its members. I noted that since the IMFC's last call just weeks ago, we have reassessed the prospects for growth for 2020 and 2021. It is now clear that we have entered a recession as bad or worse than in 2009.  We do project recovery in 2021. In fact, there may be a sizeable rebound, but only if we succeed with containing the virus everywhere and prevent liquidity problems from becoming a solvency issue. A key concern about a long-lasting impact of the sudden stop of the world economy is the risk of a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs that not only can undermine the recovery. But can erode the fabric of our societies. To avoid this from happening many countries have taken far-reaching measures to address the health crisis and to cushion its impact on the economy, both on the monetary and on the fiscal side. The G-20 yesterday reported fiscal measures totaling some five trillion dollars or over 6 percent of global GDP. It is very important for those ahead in taking action to share their experience with those still behind. To support this last night the IMF launched a policy actions tracker for 186 countries to help us all see who is doing what. We will be updating this information regularly, will provide country-specific analysis in line with our surveyor's mandate. I invite you to visit our Website, imf.org, where you will find the policy tracker. We have seen an extraordinary spike in requests for IMC emergency financing. Over 80 countries have placed requests. And more are likely to come. And normally we will never have had more than a handful of requests at any one time. Yesterday, our executive board approved the first of those requests for the Kyrgyz republic in a record first disbursement.  We also see a wide range of problems building up in emerging markets. We used the meeting to zero in on this group of countries. The spread of the virus, the shutdown of economies, capital outflows and, for commodity exporters, a price shock.  Many of these emerging markets will experience a contraction as a necessary containment measures take all that will happen, and they are already shocked by reduced global demand for their exports, for tourism, for commodities, for manufactured goods that provide critical stream of foreign exchange. Our current estimate for the overall financial needs of emerging markets is 2.5 trillion dollars. We believe this is on the lower end. We do know that their own reserves and domestic resources will not be sufficient. And it is in this context that our members are asking us to do more, doing better, do it faster than ever before, and do it in collaboration with the World Bank and other international financial institutions, which we fully embrace.  So how can we meet these challenges? First, we are proposing to double our emergency financial capacity, simplify our processes, fill the gap in our concessional financing. Second, we are reviewing our lending instruments to see what might be missing in the context of this crisis so that we can respond appropriately. For example, can we expand the use of precautionary credit lines? Can we bring forward short term liquidity provisions? What we want is: countries to approach the fund and access the tools they require for the needs they have. The sooner they do it, the sooner they obtain necessary financing, the sooner they implement good policy. The better chance we have to contain the damage and move towards recovery. Third, many of our member countries are faced with rapidly building pressures on debt, which they need to address. On that note, our board yesterday approved changes in the application of the Catastrophic Containment and Relief Trust, which can provide some debt relief to our poorest member countries. We are seeking support from the membership to increase the capacity of the CCRT. We have received pledges of support from UK, Japan and China and we hope others to join quickly.  Last but definitely not least, we need urgently to secure the borrowing capacity of the fund through new arrangements to borrow and bilateral borrowing arrangements. In this context, it is very encouraging that NAP approval is part of the US stimulus package that is before the US Congress. We need other countries that have not yet completed their domestic procedures to follow suit so we have the whole 1 trillion lending capacity of the Fund at the disposal of our members.  So what are the next steps? The IMF charged us to discuss these various options further with our executive board with a view to having a concrete package of proposals for IMFC consideration at the spring meetings. Just in a few weeks’ time, to be exact, on April 16. So it is all hands on deck at the IMF. We are working very hard to strengthen our response capacity as much as possible. We have been successfully working now more than 10 days virtually. And I'm so proud of my staff for being able to adjust to new modalities of operation and step up what we do. Thank you.  Gerry Rice Thank you very much, Kristalina Let me just clarify before we turn to your questions since we are streaming live right now, there is no embargo. So disregard what I said at the beginning because we're actually streaming life. So feel free to report and we will actually send Kristalina's remarks, what she just said, will send these out to you shortly. Again, for the ease of your reporting. Let me turn to your questions.  There are several questions on the issue of recession from Xinhua and from Mohamed al Mizell [sp], Gulf News and others. But let me take those, too, from those two sources. So Mohammed of Gulf News is asking, do you expect a global recession due to the economic impact of the pandemic? And Xinhua is is asking, the IMF predicts, a global economy to contract this year. Do you think we are ready for such a recession? And Mohammed is actually asking, is there any plan for the Middle East countries in particular to offset the outbreak of the economic fallout? So perhaps we could take that bucket of questions on recession.  Kristalina Georgieva Unfortunately, we are projecting recession for 2020. We do expect it to be quite deep and we are very much urging countries to step up containment measures aggressively so we can shorten the duration of this period of time when the economy is in standstill. And also to apply well-targeted measures, primarily focusing on the health system to absorb that enormous stress that comes from coronavirus. And on people, businesses and the financial system, I am very pleased to say that when we went through countries' responses, that sense of targeted fiscal measures is there and are also very impressive to see the size of these measures. Countries are doing all they can on the fiscal and on the monetary front. We have heard from our members' very impressive decisions taken over the last days. We also want to caution that as we are responding now, we want to make the recession as possibly short and not too deep. We also want to think about what is going to follow the recovery and make sure that we are putting forward measures that can be supportive in this regard.  For the Middle East: just to mention that yesterday we've have approved the big package for Jordan, 1.3 billion dollars. Actually, the day before. The days are now blurring with 24/7 actions. We have approved the package for Jordan, 1.3 billion dollars, very, very important for the country in this particularly challenging time. We have received a large number of requests, including from the Middle East for emergency financing. Just to give you the order of magnitude, we have primarily low-income countries coming fast. Understandably, they are going into a very tough time before this shock is to hit them. Some 50 of the requests are from low-income countries, but we also are seeing middle-income countries engaging very actively and we encourage them to do so.  Gerry Rice Thank you very much. There are a series of questions around the G-20 and its role in the crisis. Xinhua asks: The G-20 leaders held a conference call regarding the pandemic. Can you comment on the result of the G-20 conference call? And what role do you expect G-20 countries to play in the global fight against the disease?  Kristalina Georgieva The G20 leaders call brought the countries representing 85 percent of the world economy together to focus actions and coordinate among themselves with very strong concentration on the immediate task of containing the health crisis. There is a clear commitment from the G20 countries to make sure that they mobilize their collective capacity on the medical front, that trade in medical supplies is not constrained and that they share experience so action can be more impactful. They are also bringing together the package of measures on the monetary and the fiscal front. They are coordinating these measures to again to increase their impact in terms of concrete objectives to follow up. The finance ministers of the G20 are tasked to come very quickly together with an action plan. We international organizations are drawn in terms of the collective response, our engagement on the policy front and on financing and also in terms of making sure that this action plan is robust and effective.  Gerry Rice Thank you very much. There's a series of questions also specifically on emerging markets, and I'm seeing a question here from Rafaelle [sp] in Argentina and also from People's Daily China. So asking: the IMF considers it important to support emerging markets and developing economies as well to overcome the shock of the crisis. What specific measures will the IMF take to support the emerging markets and developed developing economies and people's daily also ads? And how do you view the role of China's economy in helping to stabilize the global economy?  Kristalina Georgieva We we are very much on the view that we ought to focus on emerging markets and developing economies. Many of these countries are somewhat behind in terms of the epidemic and its domestic impact. What some are already stepping in this face, but they are all tremendously negatively impacted and will be impacted even more in the future.  What we are particularly concerned with is that they are experiencing domestic shocks. They are also experiencing a very significant impact of reduction in demand for their exports, especially tourism, manufacturing goods in this incredible standstill that the world economy finds itself. On top of it, they have suffered big capital outflows. Some 83 billion dollars had left emerging markets and they for those days are commodity exporters. There is also this additional hit of the drop of commodity prices.  So how can we support emerging markets and developing economies? One, we are mobilizing for them the one trillion dollars lending capacity our shareholders have equipped us with. Two, we are concentrating on rapid response to the emergency financing requests we are receiving. As I said, 81 requests, 50 from lower-income countries, 31 from middle-income countries. We want to make sure that countries have access to financing as soon as possible. And three, we are working specifically on the tremendous burden that is falling on the shoulders of low-income countries of poor countries. Many of them have not been in a strong position made before this crisis. Many of them with high level of debt.  Engaging on that particular issue of debt sustainability is something that we have been working with the World Bank on. We want to see attention given to countries in debt distress early before it turns into a big problem for them as well as for the rest of the world economy.  On the Chinese economy. Sorry, on the China economy. China is ahead of the rest of the world in terms of being impacted by the coronavirus. Having taken containment measures with a huge drag on growth in their first quarter, they are now stepping up production. And by doing all this, not only they are marking a path from health crisis to recovery, but they are offering tremendous expertise and experience to the rest of the world. They are also now a very important source of health supplies and health experience that they are sharing with the rest of the world. Of course, China doing better in 2020, is very important for China. It is also very important for the rest of the world given China's share in the world economy.  Gerry Rice Thank you very much. I'm seeing online a number of questions from the Financial Times, James Wheatley. So I'm gonna take those. James is asking a slew of questions, some of which I think have already been answered. But let me just reiterate these questions. Which countries have requested assistance from the IMF? Have they made concrete requests or just inquiries? What's the split between large, small, low middle income? Again, we've responded to some of these. What are the IMF calculations on resources that may be needed to meet their needs? Does the IMF have an estimate of the value of debt relief proposed by the IMF and the World Bank? And there's a question about does the Fund expect the private sector to be involved in debt relief?  Kristalina Georgieva All great questions. Starting from the request, whether there are inquiries or requests. Out of the 81 we have received, three-quarters are requests and one quarter are inquiries. But we are quite confident that these inquiries are going to be turning into requests, given the fact that the situation in the world economy and individuals countries is not getting better, it is getting worse. I have already answered the split between the low- income countries, 50 of the requests are requesting parties are from low-income countries, 31 from middle-income countries.  In terms of the resources needed. We are still working on assessing exactly what is the size of the need. As I mentioned in my opening at this point, a very conservative low-end estimate of the overall financial needs of emerging markets is 2.5 trillion dollars. Let me stress a big part of this can and will be covered by domestic resources. And we are also working on establishing exactly how much that would be. But clearly, clearly the domestic resources are insufficient and this is why it is so important that the IMF mobilizes rapidly with the appropriate type of instruments to respond to this crisis. And one specific issue we are looking into is this question of liquidity. Forex liquidity. Can we expand our capacity and tools to be able to provide rapidly liquidity to emerging market countries? On the debt relief question, if we take all IDA countries, International Development Association countries, in other words, those that the World Bank considers low income by their classification. The official that on an annual basis to be serviced by these countries is just around $11 billion dollars, slightly less than 11 billion dollars. Approximately half of this is debt of countries already at high debt distress.  How we are going to approach this, of course, depends not just on us. It depends on the official creditors. And there are already discussions in the G-20 as well as in the Paris Club as to what would be an appropriate process that rapidly gets into a practical approach to prevent these countries in this time when the economy is coming to a standstill to fall off the debt cliff. In other words, to fall into an inability to serve their debt.  The sooner we do it, the better. Whether this would involve private creditors at this point of time, we have not discussed it. But I can assure you that assure you that the same way the Fund during the global financial crisis brought together both official creditors and private creditors to assess a good pathway through a dramatic crisis, we have to do it this time around as well. And it is an area in which our membership is encouraging us to move to move forward.  Gerry Rice Thank you. This is actually gonna be the last bucket of questions and it's on the U.S. and Fox Business. Jennifer Schoenberg has a number of questions. Excuse me, has a number of questions and online FFP Delphine to tweet who is also asking a U.S. question. Let me come to those. Is the U.S. in recession? How severe of a contraction do you see here in the United States? What kind of unemployment levels could we see in the U.S.? How much will the 2 trillion stimulus package help U.S. GDP? So that's all from Fox. And on top of that, AFP is asking again on the 2 trillion. Lots of economists say much more will be necessary beyond the 2 trillion. What do you think, managing director?  Kristalina Georgieva As Chairman Powell said, actually, I think it was yesterday. The U.S. is in recession, as is the rest of the advanced rest of the advanced economies world. And in a big chunk of developed and emerging markets in developing economies. How severe? We are working now on our projections for 2020. In a short while prior to the Spring Meetings, we will come up with these projections. And at that time, we will have assessed more thoroughly the data that is now coming on the impact of containment on the economy. Let me just stress that while containment is the main reason for the economy to stand still and get into a recession.  Containment is very necessary to come out of this period and step in to recovery. Until the virus is not contained, it would be very difficult to go to the lives we love.  And in that context that you're asking on unemployment and other and other factors. We are assessing very carefully any now projections. We will be able to answer this questions, as you would appreciate. We are seeing the early impact of this containment measure in the United States and elsewhere. And we are working towards a more deliberate assessment. We don't want to rush with our numbers. It is very important to be prudent in taking the,. If I can use a health terminology, taking the temperature of the economy. On the 2 trillion package: very welcome step by the US for two reasons. One, because it is absolutely necessary to cushion the world's largest economy against an abrupt drop of economic activities.  It is very important for the American people. It is also important for the rest of the world, given the significance of the United States. Second, very welcome because it is well-targeted. First, beef up the capacity of the health system. A hundred and seventeen billion dollars for hospitals. Second, helping workers and their families to be protected against a sudden loss of income so they can meet their daily needs. Third, protecting firms, large companies and SME's - small and medium sized companies. Protecting them is so critical. They stay afloat. Then when recovery comes, momentum can be injected very quickly.  And this is being done with an eye to actually insentivize companies to keep their workers on the payroll. There they would benefit if they do so. Last but not least, the measures that are there to protect the financial system. Would that be sufficient? We only can answer this question when we know how long it takes to contain the pandemic.  Gerry Rice Thank you very much. Look, as I said, we will be releasing a Kristalina Georgieva's remarks. We will be releasing the video of this press conference and the transcript very soon. And there is no embargo, so feel free to report immediately. I want to thank Kristalina Georgieva for joining us today. And I want to thank all of you for joining us today, especially in this virtual setting. We look forward to seeing you again soon at the IMF. And just wishing everyone to stay safe. Thank you very much.

The survey conducted by Sermo, a global health care polling company, of 6,227 physicians in 30 countries found that 37% of those treating COVID-19 patients rated hydroxychloroquine as the “most effective therapy” from a list of 15 options.  Of the physicians surveyed, 3,308 said they had either ordered a COVID-19 test or been involved in caring for a coronavirus patient, and 2,171 of those responded to the question asking which medications were most effective.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave chloroquine and its next-generation derivative, hydroxychloroquine, emergency-use authorization Monday for treating the novel coronavirus, although the drug was already being used off-label by some doctors and hospitals for COVID-19 patients.  The survey also found that the most commonly prescribed treatments are analgesics (56%), azithromycin (41%) and hydroxychloroquine (33%).  Azithromycin, known by the brand name Zithromax or Z-Pak, was rated the second-most effective therapy at 32%, followed by “nothing,” analgesics (including acetaminophen), anti-HIV drugs and cough medicine.  Hydroxychloroquine, which is sold under the brand name Plaquenil, was prescribed mainly in the United States for the most severe cases, but not so in other countries.  “Outside the U.S., hydroxychloroquine was equally used for diagnosed patients with mild to severe symptoms whereas in the U.S. it was most commonly used for high risk diagnosed patients,” the survey found.  The 30 nations surveyed included those in Europe, Asia, North America and South America, as well as Australia. No incentives were provided to participate in the poll, conducted March 25-27, according to Sermo.  ANNOUNCEMENT: To create a centralized & dynamic knowledge base we published results of our COVID-19 study, which over 6.2K physicians in 30 countries participated in: https://t.co/ppewwdo8wl pic.twitter.com/Fg5B6FMUCQ — Sermo (@Sermo) April 2, 2020  Hydroxychloroquine usage was most widespread in Spain, where 72% of physicians surveyed said they had prescribed it, followed by Italy at 49%, and least popular in Japan, where 7% had used it to treat COVID-19.  The poll found 23% of U.S. medical professionals had prescribed the drug, which has been FDA-approved for malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.  Debate about hydroxychloroquine has raged in the United States since President Trump touted it two weeks ago as a potential “game-changer” in the fight against the deadly pandemic, prompting critics to accuse him of peddling unproven remedies, or “snake oil,” as USA Today put it.  Sermo CEO Peter Kirk called the polling results a “treasure trove of global insights for policy makers.”  “Physicians should have more of a voice in how we deal with this pandemic and be able to quickly share information with one another and the world,” he said. “With censorship of the media and the medical community in some countries, along with biased and poorly designed studies, solutions to the pandemic are being delayed.”  The survey also found that 63% of U.S. physicians believe restrictions should be lifted in six weeks or more, and that the epidemic’s peak is at least 3-4 weeks away.  The survey also found that 83% of global physicians anticipate a second global outbreak, including 90% of U.S. doctors but only 50% of physicians in China.  On average, U.S. coronavirus testing takes 4-5 days, while 10% of cases take longer than seven days. In China, 73% of doctors reported getting rest results back in 24 hours.  In cases of ventilator shortages, all countries but China said the top criteria should be patients with the best chance of recovery (47%), followed by patients with the highest risk of death (21%), and then first responders (15%).  In China, the survey said doctors prioritized patients at greatest risk of death.  Sign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters  Copyright © 2020 The Washington Times, LLC.

The #StayAtHome campaign aims to encourage your friends and neighbours to make a personal connection to who they’re staying home to protect from COVID-19.  According to the provincial government, social distancing and other measures are already starting to show a positive effect on the number of COVID-19 cases, but more action is needed to continue flattening the curve.  Since everyone has a role to play in staying home and saving lives, the town wants you to share the reasons and people you’re staying at home for, whether it’s parents, grandparents, children or frontline workers.  Getting involved is easy– just head to the town’s website and download the printable or digital “I’m Staying Home For…” graphic.  Think of the people you’re staying home for and write down your thoughts on the paper. If you’re using the digital version, just use a program to insert text into the document.  Then take a photo or screenshot of your completed sign and post it to social media with the hashtag #StayHomeWhitby. Remember to tag the town on Facebook or Twitter too!  You can also spread the word by challenging a local business, friend or co-worker to share who they’re staying home for.

J.B. Pritzker on Friday ordered all state residents to remain in their homes except for essentials, joining similar dramatic efforts in California and New York to limit the spread of the coronavirus.  Pritzker’s order, which takes effect Saturday at 5 p.m. and is set to expire April 7, still allows the state’s 12.6 million residents to head outside to buy groceries and medicine.  “If there are actions that I can take that will save lives in the midst of this pandemic, no matter how difficult, then I have an obligation,” Pritzker said. The Democrat said he was trying to prevent “potentially tens of thousands” of deaths but urged people not to panic.  “For the vast majority of you already taking precautions, your lives will not change very much,” he said, adding that people can continue to shop for groceries and visit pharmacies, gas stations and banks. Residents also can continue to pick up meals from restaurants and exercise outdoors, he said.  Pritzker acknowledged that the state doesn’t have the resources or “the desire” to broadly enforce the order, but he said law enforcement will take action if necessary in individual cases. The order exempts people who work in many essential industries, including health care, manufacturing, transportation and food production or sales, including at grocery stores and restaurants.  The stay-at-home order will also mean schools statewide remain closed until April 8, he said.  Pritzker had previously ordered all schools statewide to shut down through the end of March and limited gatherings to 50 people to curb the spread of the coronavirus in the state. He also closed dine-in service at bars and restaurants, but allowed businesses to continue delivery or carryout options.  The governors of California and New York have issued similar orders.  Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who stood by Pritzker’s side as he announced the order, said she agreed with the decision.  “Think of this as safer at home,” she said.  For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  The vast majority of people recover from the virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild cases recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe ones can take three to six weeks to get better.  As of Friday afternoon, Illinois has reported 585 cases of COVID-19 in 25 counties, up from 422 a day earlier. The state reported one more death Friday - a woman in her 70s from Cook County - taking the state’s toll to five.   ___  O’Connor reported from Springfield, Illinois.   ___  Follow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbrea k   ___  The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

By noon you ached all over and started coughing. You’re also a little bit winded and really tired. Is this the flu? Or is it COVID-19?  COVID-19 can cause anything from mild cold symptoms to most common flu-like symptoms, such as headache, cough, fever, trouble breathing, sore throat, and diarrhea. In some people it becomes life-threatening very quickly. You are 10 times more likely to end up in the hospital because of COVID-19 than the flu. COVID-19 seems to most seriously affect those who have heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, lung disease, cancer, and immunodeficiency – and patients who survive a serious infection may be left with lifelong problems. The most seriously affected are those older than 65, but even those age 20-40 make up 40% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Younger children are less likely to become seriously ill, but they can spread the disease while having mild to no symptoms. Because this virus is completely new to humans there is a lot we’re still learning and much more we do not yet know.  It’s tempting to think COVID-19 is “just a flu.” In 1918, America was experiencing the same sort of anxiety because of the Spanish flu. That was roughly 100 years ago, and no one then was saying, “It’s just the flu.” The CDC estimates that 50 million people world wide died during the Spanish Flu pandemic. Since then, the study of the flu virus has led to development of vaccines and effective treatment. Despite the flu virus mutating and changing yearly, our immune systems are better at fighting it. This is because it has seen some version of the virus before, whether through illness or from vaccination. Once fighting off an enemy virus, it’s as if the immune system maintains a “most wanted criminal” poster and a small, dedicated army just in case the virus shows up again. Our systems then have a head start fighting off a viral infection before becoming seriously ill. When many people in a population already have these immune system defenses, they become like shields protecting others who are not immune. We call this “heard immunity.” When there is no herd immunity—meaning no one is immune yet—the virus quickly spreads from person to person, infecting many people within a short amount of time.  Until recently, the coronavirus (known as COVID-19) only infected animals. One day in 2019, enough of the genetic material randomly mutated, making it able to infect a human. We do not know exactly how it happened but imagine this: The first infected human coughed on something, let’s say a door handle. Along came another human who touched the door handle then touched their lips. Just that quickly, the virus has jumped from one human to another, infecting person after person. From there it spread through the human population like wildfire, each person easily infecting two or three others before anyone even knows they are sick.  Unlike the seasonal flu, our immune systems have never seen this enemy, and we are all defenseless. We have no others around us with immunity to act as a shield and slow the spread. COVID-19 is at least twice as contagious as the flu. It’s estimated that if no action is taken to stop the spread, at least 50-80% of the world’s population will become infected. Information suggests that 80% of infected people will have mild or no symptoms, and 20% of those infected will need care at the hospital to recover. Five out of every 100 people (5%) infected will need additional care in the ICU with a ventilator to help them breathe during a long recovery. Comparatively, the flu hospitalization rate is only one out of every 100 people (1%), and that number is spread out over months, not weeks. The death rate for COVID-19 is four to 20 times higher than influenza. COVID-19 is unlike any flu we have seen in modern times.  Sampson County’s population is approximately 63,000 people. Assuming these statistics, if we go about our business as usual and allow the virus to spread rapidly as it has in some cities, we can expect possibly as many as 50,400 people to become infected. Of those people infected, 10,800 (20%) are expected to become sick enough to need hospitalization, and 2,520 (25%) of those hospitalized are expected to need care in the intensive care unit, including breathing support. To put this in perspective, Sampson Regional typically staffs about 60 patient beds and has surge plans to expand up to about 116 beds, with at most 20 of those being ICU beds. In preparation for this pandemic, the hospital has made significant preparations to increase general supplies and the number of ventilators, but even so, you can see that there still won’t be enough room if thousands of people become seriously ill from COVID-19 in a short amount of time.  The number of people we lose in our community depends a lot on whether we can work together to “flatten the curve” and slow the spread. No doubt you have heard a lot about social distancing to “flatten the curve.” What this means is that we want to reduce the physical distance between people to slow the spread. When this is done well, we prevent a big wave of people who all need hospital care at once and instead spread out those needs over time. If the hospital is overflowing with COVID-19 patients, resources become stretched so thin that it becomes difficult to care for many other healthcare needs, such as surgeries, car accidents, traumas, heart attacks, and strokes. In the large Chinese Province of Hubei where they did not “flatten the curve” with social distancing, the death rate was approximately 2.5 people for every 100 people infected. In a smaller nearby city were people did stay home, the infection spread more slowly, and they were able to provide better hospital care. Seventy-five percent fewer infected people died from COVID-19 in that smaller city. If we are very careful and staying home, Sampson County will be like the smaller city. The difference between the two scenarios could mean hundreds of lives saved in Sampson County.  It takes about 14 days to recover from and begin developing some immunity to COVID-19. With a at least a few weeks of strict social distancing (no parties, school, cookouts, neighbor visits, or play dates), the virus will stop spreading so fast. We then will likely have developed some herd immunity to slow the spread for the time we all go back out again. It gives hospitals and medical offices time to restock supplies and laboratories time to boost testing capabilities so that we can quickly isolate new cases. It gives scientists time to develop a vaccine or discover treatments and medications to fight COVID-19. It will give us time to save many more lives.  We can do this! We have worked together to help each other through hard times after hurricanes Florence and Matthew. We can work together now to beat COVID-19. We will work together to help our community and businesses recover when this is over. Please help your neighbor. Please help your granny. Please help your doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists, other healthcare workers, and emergency services stay healthy so that we can all continue helping you.   https://www.clintonnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/web1_COVIDvsFLU-Infographic1.jpg https://www.clintonnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/web1_COVIDvsFLU-Infographic2.jpg  By Dr. Amy Straiko-Howerton Special to the Independent  Dr. Amy Straiko-Howerton is American Board Certified in Family Medicine and has 15 years of experience in rural healthcare.

NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman announced Thursday it is pausing its season, one day after the NBA suspended play after a player tested positive Wednesday for COVID-19.  “In light of ongoing developments resulting from the coronavirus, and after consulting with medical experts and convening a conference call of the Board of Governors, the National Hockey League is announcing today that it will pause the 2019‑20 season beginning with tonight’s games,” Bettman said in a statement. “The NHL has been attempting to follow the mandates of health experts and local authorities, while preparing for any possible developments without taking premature or unnecessary measures. However, following last night’s news that an NBA player has tested positive for coronavirus — and given that our leagues share so many facilities and locker rooms and it now seems likely that some member of the NHL community would test positive at some point — it is no longer appropriate to try to continue to play games at this time.”  The NHL is halting play with 189 games left in the season and uncertainty about how many more — if any — could be played before the playoffs. A handful of European hockey leagues have already called off the remainder of their seasons.  “We will continue to monitor all the appropriate medical advice, and we will encourage our players and other members of the NHL community to take all reasonable precautions — including by self-quarantine, where appropriate,” Bettman said. “Our goal is to resume play as soon as it is appropriate and prudent, so that we will be able to complete the season and award the Stanley Cup.”  In anticipation of the season being suspended, numerous teams set to play road games were already finalizing plans to return home in the afternoon. The NHL preceded it’s decision to suspend the season by having all 31 teams cancel practices and pre-game skates. There were 10 games scheduled for Thursday night.  It’s unclear what this move means for the rest of the regular season or playoffs.  The Stanley Cup has been awarded every year since 1893 with two exceptions: in 1919 when the final was canceled after five games because of the Spanish flu outbreak and in 2005 when the season was called off because of a lockout.  For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.  The NBA suspended its season after Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19. A person with knowledge told The Associated Press on Thursday that Gobert’s Utah teammate, Donovan Mitchell, also tested positive.  So far, the NHL has not said any player has tested positive for COVID-19.  The NHL as recently as 2012-13 cut down to a 48-game regular season after a lockout. That season did include full playoffs.  As of Wednesday, the NHL did not have a leaguewide declaration about even potentially holding games in empty arenas without fans in the stands. The Columbus Blue Jackets became the first team to take that step, saying their games would go on with attendance “limited to home and visiting club personnel, credentialed media and broadcast partners, essential club and arena staff and NHL officials.” The San Jose Sharks then said their remaining home games in March would go on without fans.  The NWHL postponed its Isobel Cup final scheduled for Friday night in Boston but did not give a new date.  A person with direct knowledge of discussions tells The Associated Press that a recommendation has been made to the IIHF to cancel the men’s world championships in Switzerland.

We were the team who kept pushing on, but they were clinical and we were not,” Coyle added.  Chin up!

There were two things from our perspective. One, we were not clinical enough with our chances and second, I felt ATK’s last two goals were certainly avoidable,” he said.  “I think ATK will be very relieved to get away with the trophy given what we brought to the game. But that is how football is at the highest level.”  Coyle praised ATK goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharja despite he was being the thorn in Chennaiyin’s flesh by saving some crucial saves.  “However, I have to say ATK’s goal in the first half was a wonderful finish and credit to them. The man of the match for me was their goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharja. He was truly outstanding. I have to give credit to ATK for winning,” he said.  Despite the disappointing stumble in the final hurdle, it has been a season to remember for the Marina Machans who made it to the summit clash after languishing near the bottom of the table midway into the season.  Coyle took up the reigns of the team in December last year after John Gregory was sacked for winning just one game out of the first six – against tail-enders Hyderabad FC.

The new rules call on anyone in the country to work from home as much as possible especially if they have any respiratory symptoms or a fever, for medical personnel, first responders, and essential workers to cancel travel to countries abroad, and a ban on all events where over a hundred people are to meet in one place.  The new rules are in place until March 31 for the entire country, including Noord-Brabant, the province hardest hit by the coronavirus outbreak. People in vulnerable health and elderly people should avoid large groups and using public transportation, and Netherlands residents were told to limit contact with those susceptible to illness to limit their chances of exposure.  \"Everyone in the Netherlands: stay at home with complaints of a cold, cough, sore throat or fever. Avoid social contact. Do not call your doctor until complaints get worse,\" the government said in a statement. All public locations where more than a hundred people gather will be affected by the event ban. It includes \"museums, concert halls, theaters, sports clubs and sports competitions.\"  Prime Minister Mark Rutte called on all people in the Netherlands to cooperate with the new rules. \"The impact is greatest if everyone sticks to what we decided on today,\" he said at a press conference after an emergency meeting of his Cabinet. \"People can still go outdoors, but we are asking for some very specific things,\" he said.  \"People all over the Netherlands are called upon to work from home as much as possible,\" said Healthcare Minister Bruno Bruins. \"Do not hold meetings with more than 100 people,\" he stated.  The rules were a little different for medical personnel, Rutte said. \"Most people must stay home when you feel [flu] symptoms or a fever.\" But healthcare staff, he said, should only stay at home if they have a fever combined with either a cough or shortness of breath. \"Because we so badly need them.\"  Prime Minister Mark Rutte also called on higher education programs to cancel classes in lecture halls, and to find alternative means for teaching students. \"The urgent advice is to offer online lectures,\" he said.  However, daycare services, primary schools and high schools were not going to be ordered closed, Rutte said, as children and young people are not in an urgent risk group. \"The social consequences would then be too great, because parents would also have to stay at home. They work for the police, the fire brigade, [and municipal health service] GGD,\" he stated.  \"For schools: if someone has health complaints you have to stay at home,\" said Jaap van Dissel, the Director of the RIVM. \"That is a very important thing.\"  When asked if the Netherlands was too late, or too lax, in its approach to the coronavirus crisis, Rutte replied that all decisions have been made with the scientific insights available at that moment. \"In crises like this, you have to make 100 percent of the decisions with 50 percent of the knowledge, and bear the consequences.\"  Similarly, Rutte left the door open for even stricter rules to come into force. \"We do not exclude the possibility that more measures will be added in the following days.\"  Increasing pressure to develop tighter restrictions  Pressure was mounting on the Dutch government to take more measures against the spread of Covid-19. In parliament, the PVV and SP questioned the government's policy, pointing out that other countries are doing much more against the virus.  SP parliamentarian Maarten Hijink wants Minister Bruno Bruins for Medical Care to \"make clear why our measures deviate from what is done elsewhere and why measures are limited to Brabant so far,\" according to the Telegraaf.  The PVV called on the government to take further steps in the fight against the virus. \"People all over the Netherlands - just like in Brabant - should stay at home for the time being and in social isolation. Close universities and schools. Prohibit all events. Avoid groups,\" PVV leader Geert Wilders said to the Telegraaf.  On Thursday the general association of school leaders AVS called for schools in the Netherlands to close. \"It is inconceivable that schools are still open. Look at Italy. We must prevent the spread of the virus in both primary and secondary education,\" AVS chairman Peter van Haren said to NOS.  Multiple online petitions were launched to achieve the same thing. One was for Deltion College in Zwolle to close after a teacher was diagnosed with the virus. The teacher is in home isolation, but colleagues and pupils who had contact with them can still go to school, according to De Stentor. Another petition to close all schools in the country was signed over thousand times as of 1:45 p.m. on Thursday.  On Thursday morning Minister Stef Blok of Foreign Affairs told NOS from Indonesia that he does not think the Netherlands is taking too few measures. \"The assessment of the measures we have to take really lies with the experts, the doctors at RIVM. If they indicate that we need to take stricter measures, we must take them, but on the basis of extra advice.\"  Coronavirus situation in The Netherlands today  So far, medical personnel have tested 6,000 people in the Netherlands for coronavirus. Another 11,000 samples are still being processed, a spokesperson for national health agency RIVM told NL Times.  Noord-Brabant is currently the Dutch province most affected by the coronavirus, counting in the Netherlands, counting 273 residents among the 614 positive test cases in the Netherlands. The reported total is an increase of 50 cases in Noord-Brabant over Wednesday's totals, and an increase of 111 for the country. The RIVM advised Noord-Brabant residents to stay at home if they show even mild cold-like symptoms, the province called on residents to work from home as much as possible, and the mayors of Tilburg, Eindhoven and Den Bosch called for large events to be canceled and for people to refrain from social contacts for a week.  There were also 80 cases in the Utrecht province, 68 in Zuid-Holland, 53 in Limburg, and 48 in Gelderland, RIVM said.  Among the 614 patients, 252 were infected in the Netherlands, and 239 were infected abroad including 193 who caught the virus in Italy. Another 26 patients likely acquired the virus on a trip to Austria, seven in Germany, and a smattering of patients were infected in Belgium, Mauritus, South Korea and Spain.  It is unclear how 123 people acquired the virus, and most of those patients reside in Noord-Brabant. Over a hundred Dutch patients work in healthcare, the RIVM said.   The U.S. Entry Ban  Although U.S. President Donald Trump announced a ban on non-U.S. citizens entering the country from the Schengen Region, including the Netherlands, the situation was not clear down to the smallest details, acknowledged the American ambassador in The Hague. He said he would meet with management at KLM to address questions about pilots and flight crews, and if they will be exempted from the entry ban.  \"We believe that the number one role of the President is to keep the American people safe,\" said U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands Pete Hoekstra in an interview on NOS. \"Of course it's going to have an economic impact.\"  The entry ban is for anyone who has been in the 26 Schengen Countries in the European Union in the past 14 days. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it would develop a plan for allowing American citizens back into the country as an exemption to the entry ban before the weekend.  The Department of Homeland Security overnight did not make it imediately clear if American citizens and their families could face a quarantine period, or if they could fly back to any American airport.

Entrance is refused to people who are not citizens or residents of Israel and who have been in China in the 14 days leading up to their arrival. As of now, the border crossings have not been closed to those who have been in other locations.\"  The likelihood of Israeli citizens being infected with the coronavirus has “risen significantly,” Health Ministry director-general Moshe Bar Siman Tov warned on Saturday evening.His statement came after nine South Koreans tested positive for coronavirus after returning home on February 15 from an eight-day visit to Israel. While it’s unknown whether the group contracted the virus before or after their return to South Korea, the Health Ministry is operating on the assumption that they arrived in Israel as carriers of the virus, which has a 14-day incubation period during which those infected are asymptomatic.Speaking to reporters in Tel Aviv, Bar Siman Tov said the group had likely come into contact with “hundreds” of Israelis during their stay in the country. The Health Ministry published the details of their itinerary, including visits to numerous Jerusalem churches, the Dead Sea, Masada, Beersheba, Caesarea and Hebron’s Cave of the Patriarchs.All Israelis who came into contact with one of the infected individuals – defined as within two meters for at least 15 minutes – have been instructed to remain in isolation for two weeks.Following time spent in proximity to the infected tourists, the Education Ministry instructed a group of 30 school pupils and two teachers to remain in self-quarantine until February 27. Another teacher was undergoing tests on Saturday evening at Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba after reportedly developing flu-like symptoms. Another 60 students from the Qiryat Haim neighborhood near Haifa will also be in home-quarantine after coming into contact with the South Koreans during a visit to Masada.Seeking to contain a possible outbreak in Israel, Bar Siman Tov said Israeli nationals arriving from China, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea or Japan will be required to spend two weeks in isolation following their return.The latest quarantine order follows a sharp increase in new cases of coronavirus across South Korea over the weekend. Approximately 1,000 South Korean tourists currently visiting Israel have been instructed to remain in isolation in their hotels.Almost 200 foreign nationals who landed at Ben-Gurion Airport on a Korean Air flight from Seoul on Saturday evening were not permitted to disembark. Twelve Israeli nationals on board the flight were permitted to disembark far from Terminal Three and transported home by Magen David Adom ambulances. After refueling, the empty plane was expected to return immediately to the South Korean capital.The Foreign Ministry announced that Israeli Ambassador to China Zvi Hefetz who traveled onboard the same flight to Seoul as the nine South Korean tourists, would remain in quarantine in Beijing. Other embassy staff will not face any limitations, the ministry said.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that he would hold a meeting about the coronavirus in the Health Ministry’s “war room” on Sunday morning. The meeting will be a continuation of last week’s discussions on preparation for dealing with the spread of the virus in light of recent developments. Health Minister Yaakov Litzman, other cabinet ministers, and ministry and hospital directors-general are expected to attend. A weekly cabinet meeting scheduled for Sunday was canceled.Speaking to The Jerusalem Post last week, Netanyahu said the public should be aware of “government agencies working to thwart and prevent the spread of the disease, so far successfully.”“No one knows the extent of the virus,” Netanyahu said. “What I don’t want to have is people panicking because they don’t think there is someone in charge. I don’t think any country in the world is better organized in addressing this challenge than Israel.”Two weeks before Israel heads to the polls again on March 2, Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan instructed police on Saturday night to be ready to prevent any election interference resulting from a possible corona outbreak, including “the distribution of fake news likely to create panic and prevent voters heading to the polls in particular regions.”The Health Ministry said on Friday that one Israeli citizen who returned to Israel from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama, Japan had tested positive as a carrier of the novel coronavirus. The citizen remains in quarantine at Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, along with 10 other passengers who also returned from the ship.On Saturday, China reported a sharp fall in new deaths and cases of the coronavirus, but World Health Organization (WHO) officials warned it was too early to make predictions about the outbreak as infections continued to rise in other countries.Chinese authorities said the mainland had 397 new confirmed cases on Friday, down from 889 a day earlier. The numbers surged elsewhere, though, with outbreaks worsening in South Korea, Iran, Italy and Lebanon.In South Korea, authorities said on Saturday the number of new infections had doubled to 433, and suggested the tally could rise significantly as more than 1,000 people who attended a church at the center of the outbreak reported flu-like symptoms.The WHO welcomed the reported decline in new Chinese cases, but said it was concerned about the number of new infections elsewhere with no clear link to China such as travel history or contact with a confirmed case of Covid-19, as the disease caused by the virus is known.The UN agency is calling for $675 million to support most vulnerable countries, he said, adding 13 countries in Africa are seen as a priority because of their links to China.In total, China has reported 75,569 cases to the WHO, and 2,239 deaths. According to available data, the disease remains mild in 80% of patients, and severe or critical in 20%. The virus has been fatal in 2% of reported cases. The disease has spread to some 26 countries and territories outside mainland China, killing more than a dozen people, according to a Reuters tally.Gil Hoffman, Lahav Harkov and Reuters contributed to this story.

Alaska’s chief medical officer says the state has a fisheries work group looking at how small communities can handle influxes of fishermen and processing workers while adhering to health guidelines, The Alaska Journal of Commerce reported Wednesday.  “We know the fish are coming regardless of COVID-19 or not and we can’t ask them to stay home,” Dr. Anne Zink said March 30.  The Copper River sockeye and king fishery that unofficially begins the annual salmon harvest in mid-May will be one of the first testing grounds.  United Fishermen of Alaska Executive Director Frances Leach said fishing groups across the state are attempting to adjust fishing operations to the challenges caused by the virus.  For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.  “Commercial fishermen are kind of infamous for not giving away their secret fishing spots so trying to shift gears and make sure we’re all communicating and sharing information during this time is really important,” Leach said.  The goal is to standardize new health guidelines and corresponding procedures for each fishery to ensure fishermen and support workers know what is expected, Leach said.  Industry leaders are developing and submitting vessel action plans to the state detailing steps they plan to take to prevent the spread of the virus while fishing and how they will respond if a ship worker develops symptoms during the season, Leach said.  “Just because we’re considered a critical workforce doesn’t mean that we can just run off and start fishing,” Leach said.

Of those 9 studies only one, performed in CHina under less than ideal conditions, showed no improvement. At this point every patient testing positive should be offered this drug. The side effects etc are well known and almost non existant for short term use, The FDA finally approved the off label use of this drug for coronavirus last week (Off Label means that the drug already approved for one use can be used for illness' that are not supported by the original regulatory filing). The Michigan gov has flip flopped on his ban and earlier this week Italy announced that it one region every COVID19 positive patient will be put on this drug.

In January, well before the coronavirus (Covid-19) crisis would result in lockdowns, quarantines and economic devastation in the United States and beyond, the U.S. intelligence community and the Pentagon were working with the National Security Council to create still-classified plans to respond to an imminent pandemic. It has since been alleged that the intelligence and military intelligence communities knew about a likely pandemic in the United States as early as last November, and potentially even before then.  Given this foreknowledge and the numerous simulations conducted in the United States last year regarding global viral pandemic outbreaks, at least six of varying scope and size, it has often been asked – Why did the government not act or prepare if an imminent global pandemic and the shortcomings of any response to such an event were known? Though the answer to this question has frequently been written off as mere “incompetence” in mainstream media circles, it is worth entertaining the possibility that a crisis was allowed to unfold.  Why would the intelligence community or another faction of the U.S. government knowingly allow a crisis such as this to occur? The answer is clear if one looks at history, as times of crisis have often been used by the U.S. government to implement policies that would normally be rejected by the American public, ranging from censorship of the press to mass surveillance networks. Though the government response to the September 11 attacks, like the Patriot Act, may be the most accessible example to many Americans, U.S. government efforts to limit the flow of “dangerous” journalism and surveil the population go back to as early as the First World War. Many of these policies, whether the Patriot Act after 9/11 or WWI-era civilian “spy” networks, did little if anything to protect the homeland, but instead led to increased surveillance and control that persisted long after the crisis that spurred them had ended.  Using this history as a lens, it is possible to look at the current coronavirus crisis to see how the long-standing agendas of ever-expanding mass surveillance and media censorship are again getting a dramatic boost thanks to the chaos unleashed by the coronavirus pandemic. Yet, this crisis is unique because it also has given a boost to a newer yet complimentary agenda that — if fulfilled – would render most, if not all, other government efforts at controlling and subduing their populations obsolete.   DARPA Dystopia  For years, the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has remained largely out of sight and out of mind for most Americans, as their research projects are rarely covered by the mainstream media and, when they are, their projects are often praised as “bringing science fiction movies to life.” However, there have been recent events that have marred DARPA’s often positive portrayal by media outlets, which paint the agency as a beacon of scientific “progress” that has “changed the world” for the better.  For instance, in 2018, a group of European scientists accused the DARPA’s “Insect Allies” program of actually being a dystopian bioweapons program that would see insects introduce genetically modified viruses into plants to attack and devastate a targeted nation’s food supply. DARPA, of course, maintained that its intent to use these insects to genetically modify plants was instead about “protecting” the food supply. Regardless of DARPA’s assertions that it is merely a “defensive” program, it should be clear to readers that such a technology could easily be used either way, depending on the wielder.  Though DARPA’s futuristic weapons of war often get the most attention from media, the agency has longstanding interests in tinkering with, not just the biology of plants, but of humans. DARPA, which is funded to the tune of approximately $3 billion a year, has various avenues through which it pursues these ambitions, with many of those now under the purview of the agency’s “Biological Technologies Office” (BTO), created in 2014. As of late, some of DARPA’s human biology and biotech projects at its BTO have been getting a massive PR boost thanks to the current coronavirus crisis, with recent reports even claiming that the agency “might have created the best hopes for stopping Covid-19.”  Most of these technologies garnering positive media coverage thanks to Covid-19 were developed several years ago. They include the DARPA-funded platforms used to produce DNA and RNA vaccines, classes of vaccine that has never been approved for human use in the U.S. and involve injecting foreign genetic material into the human body. Notably, it is this very class of vaccine, now being produced by DARPA-partnered companies, that billionaire and global health “philanthropist” Bill Gates recently asserted has him “most excited” relative to other Covid-19 vaccine candidates. Yet, key aspects regarding these vaccines and other DARPA “healthcare” initiatives have been left out of these recent positive reports, likely because they provide a window into what is arguably the agency’s darkest agenda.   “In Vivo Nanoplatforms”  In 2006, DARPA announced its Predicting Health and Disease (PHD) program, which sought to determine “whether an individual will develop an infectious disease prior to the onset of symptoms.” The PHD program planned to accomplish this by “identifying changes in the baseline state of human health through frequent surveillance” with a specific focus on “viral, upper respiratory pathogens.”  Three years later, in 2010, DARPA-funded researchers at Duke University created the foundation for this tool, which would use the genetic analysis of blood samples to determine if someone is infected with a virus before they show symptoms. Reports at the time claimed that these “preemptive diagnoses” would be transmitted to “a national, web-based influenza map” available via smartphone.  Following the creation of DARPA’s BTO in 2014, this particular program gave rise to the “In Vivo Nanoplatforms (IVN)” program. The diagnostics branch of that program, abbreviated as IVN:Dx, “investigates technologies that incorporate implantable nanoplatforms composed of bio-compatible, nontoxic materials; in vivo sensing of small and large molecules of biological interest; multiplexed detection of analytes at clinically relevant concentrations; and external interrogation of the nanoplatforms without using implanted electronics for communication.” Past reports on the program describe it as developing “classes of nanoparticles to sense and treat illness, disease, and infection on the inside. The tech involves implantable nanoparticles which sense specific molecules of biological interest.”  DARPA’s IVN program has since helped to finance and produce “soft, flexible hydrogels that are injected just beneath the skin to perform [health] monitoring and that sync to a smartphone app to give the use immediate health insights,” a product currently marketed and created by the DARPA-funded and National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded company Profusa. Profusa, which has received millions upon millions from DARPA in recent years, asserts that the information generated by their injectable biosensor would be “securely shared” and accessible to “individuals, physicians and public health practitioners.” However, the current push for a national “contact tracing” system based on citizens’ private health data is likely to expand that data sharing, conveniently fitting with DARPA’s years-old goal of creating a national, web-based database of preemptive diagnoses.  Profusa is also backed by Google, which is intimately involved in these new mass surveillance “contact tracing” initiatives, and counts former Senate majority leader William Frist among its board members. They are also partnered with the National Institutes of Health (NIH)The company also has considerable overlap with the diagnostic company Cepheid, which recently won FDA approval for its rapid coronavirus test and was previously awarded lucrative government contracts to detect anthrax in the U.S. postal system. As of this past March, Profusa again won DARPA funding to determine if their injectable biosensors can predict future pandemics, including the now widely predicted “second wave” of Covid-19, and detect those infected up to three weeks before they would otherwise show symptoms. The company expects to have its biosensors FDA licensed for this purpose by early next year, about the same time a coronavirus vaccine is expected to be available to the general public.   “Living Foundries”  Another long-standing DARPA program, now overseen by BTO, is known as “Living Foundries.” According to DARPA’s website, Living Foundries “aims to enable adaptable, scalable, and on-demand production of [synthetic] molecules by programming the fundamental metabolic processes of biological systems to generate a vast number of complex molecules that are not otherwise accessible. Through Living Foundries, DARPA is transforming synthetic biomanufacturing into a predictable engineering practice supportive of a broad range of national security objectives.”  The types of research this “Living Foundries” program supports involves the creation of “artificial life” including the creation of artificial genetic material, including artificial chromosomes, the creation of “entirely new organisms,” and using artificial genetic material to “add new capacities” to human beings (i.e. genetically modifying humans through the insertion of synthetically-created genetic material).  The latter is of particular concern (though all are honestly concerning), as DARPA also has a project called “Advanced Tools for Mammalian Genome Engineering,” which – despite having “mammalian” in the name – is focused specifically on improving “the utility of Human Artificial Chromosomes (HACs),” which DARPA describes as a “fundamental tool in the development of advanced therapeutics, vaccines, and cellular diagnostics.” Though research papers often focus on HACs as a revolutionary medical advancement, they are also frequently promoted as a means of “enhancing” humans by imbuing them with non-natural characteristics, including halting aging or improving cognition.  DARPA is known to be involved in research where these methods are used to create “super soldiers” that no longer require sleep or regular meals, among other augmented “features,” and has another program about creating “metabolically dominant” fighters. Reports on these programs also discuss the other, very disconcerting use of these same technologies, “genetic weapons” that would “subvert DNA” and “undermine people’s minds and bodies.”  Another potential application being actively investigated by DARPA is its BioDesign program, which is examining the creation of synthetic organisms that are created to be immortal and programmed with a “kill switch” allowing a synthetic, yet organic organism to be “turned off” at any time. This has led some to speculate such research could open the doors to the creation of “human replicants” used for fighting wars and other tasks, such as those that appear in the science fiction film Bladerunner.  However, these genetic “kill switches” could also be inserted into actual humans through artificial chromosomes, which – just as they have the potential to extend life – also have the potential to cut it short. Notably, it was revealed in 2017 that DARPA had invested $100 million in “gene drive” research, which is involves the use of genetic modification to wipe out entire populations, explaining why it it often referred to as a “genetic extinction” technology.  In addition, other DARPA experiments involve the use of genetically modified viruses that insert genetic material into human cells, specifically neurons in the brain, in order to “tweak” human brain chemistry. In one example, DARPA-funded research has altered human brain cells to produce two new proteins, the first allowing neural activity to be easily detected by external devices and the second allowing “magnetic nanoparticles” to “induce an image or sound in the patient’s mind.”   “Next-Generation Nonsurgical Neurotechnology”  Changing human brain chemistry and functionality at the cellular level is only one of numerous DARPA initiatives aimed at changing how human beings think and perceive reality. Since 2002, DARPA has acknowledged its efforts to create a “Brain-Machine Interface (BMI).” Though first aimed at creating “a wireless brain modem for a freely moving rat,” which would allow the animal’s movements to be remotely controlled, DARPA wasn’t shy about the eventual goal of applying such brain “enhancement” to humans in order to enable soldiers to “communicate by thought alone” or remotely control human beings (on the enemy side only, so they say) for the purposes of war.  The project, which has advanced greatly in recent years, has long raised major concerns among prominent defense scientists, some of whom warned in a 2008 report that “remote guidance or control of a human being” could quickly backfire were an adversary to gain access to the implanted technology (opening up the possibility of “hacking” a person’s brain), and they also raised concerns about the general ethical perils of such technologies. Work began in 2011 on developing “brain implants” for use in human soldiers, officially with the goal of treating neurological damage in veterans, and such implants have been tested on human volunteers in DARPA-funded experiments since at least 2015.  Concerns, like those raised by those defense scientists in 2008, have been regularly dismissed by DARPA, which has consistently claimed that its controversial research projects are tempered by their in-house “ethical experts.” However, it worth noting how DARPA’s leadership views these ethical conundrums, since they ultimately have the last word. For example, in 2015, Michael Goldblatt, then-director of DARPA’s Defense Sciences Office (DSO), which oversees most aspects of the agency’s “super soldier” program, told journalist Annie Jacobsen that he saw no difference between “having a chip in your brain that could help control your thoughts” and “a cochlear implant that helps the deaf hear.” When pressed about the unintended consequences of such technology, Goldblatt stated that “there are unintended consequences for everything.”  Thus, it is worth pointing out that, while DARPA-developed technologies – from human genetic engineering to the brain-machine interfaces – are often first promoted as something that will revolutionize and improve human health, DARPA sees the use of these technologies for such ends as being on the same footing as other dystopian and frankly nightmarish applications, like thought control. BMIs are no exception, having first been promoted as a way to “boost bodily functions of veterans with neural damage or post-traumatic stress disorder” and to allow amputees to control advanced prosthetics. While these do indeed represent major medical advances, DARPA’s leadership has made it clear that they see no distinction between the medical use of BMIs and using them to exert near total control over a human being by “guiding” their thoughts and even their movements.  Such stark admission from DARPA’s leadership makes it worth exploring the state of these current “brain-machine” interface programs as well as their explicit goals. For instance, one of the goals of DARPA’s Next-Generation Nonsurgical Neurotechnology (N3) program involves using “noninvasive or minimally invasive brain-computer interfaces” to “read and write” directly onto the brain.  According to one recent report on DARPA’s N3 program, one example of “minimally invasive” technologies would involve:  an injection of a virus carrying light-sensitive sensors, or other chemical, biotech, or self-assembled nanobots that can reach individual neurons and control their activity independently without damaging sensitive tissue. The proposed use for these technologies isn’t yet well-specified, but as animal experiments have shown, controlling the activity of single neurons at multiple points is sufficient to program artificial memories of fear, desire, and experiences directly into the brain.  Though the purported goal of N3 is related to creating “thought-controlled” weapons that react and fire based on a soldier’s thoughts, the fact that the technology is also bidirectional, opens up the disturbing possibility that efforts will be made to control and program a soldier’s thoughts and perceptions as opposed to the other way around. This may be more of the plan than DARPA has publicly let on, since official military documents have openly stated that the Pentagon’s ultimate goal is to essentially replace human fighters with “self-aware” interconnected robots “who” will both design and conduct operations against targets chosen by artificial-intelligence systems. This weapons system of the not-so-distant future seems to have little room for human beings, even those capable of “controlling” weapons with their minds, suggesting that futurist military planners see soldiers with BMIs as a “weapon” that would also become connected to this same AI-driven system. It is also worth pointing out that DARPA has been attempting to create an “artificial human brain” since 2013.  In addition, reports on DARPA’s BMI efforts have suggested that this bidirectional technology will be used to “cloud the perception of soldiers” by “distancing them from the emotional guilt of warfare,” a move that would set a dangerous precedent and one that would surely result in a marked jump in war crimes.  Of course, these are just the admitted, potential “military” applications of such technology. Once this technology moves from the military to the civilian sphere, as several DARPA inventions have in the past, their use for “remote guidance”, “thought control” and/or the programming of thoughts and experiences is more than likely to be misused by governments, corporations and other power-brokers in the U.S. and beyond for the purposes of control.  The entrance of BMIs into the civilian sphere isn’t very far away, as DARPA executives and researchers who have worked on the N3 and other DARPA-backed BMI programs have since been “scooped up” by Verily (a Google-GlaxoSmithKline partnership), Elon Musk’s Neuralink and Facebook’s Building 8 – all of which have been working to bring “neuro-modulation” devices and BMIs to market.  “Human Bio-reactors”, “Nanotherapeutics” and DARPA-funded gene vaccines  As detailed above, DARPA often frames the controversial technologies it develops as being developed to mainly advance medicine and healthcare. Aside from the technologies already discussed, it is important to note that DARPA has been very interested in healthcare, specifically vaccines, for some time.  For instance, in 2010, DARPA began developing a class of vaccine that could “inoculate against unknown pathogens,” a component of its Accelerated Manufacture of Pharmaceuticals program. The vaccine would inject thousands of synthetic antibodies, such as those developed through DARPA’s “Living Foundries” program, into the human body. These synthetic antibodies or “synbodies” would then “create an immunity toolkit that can be combined in myriad ways to tackle virtually any pathogen.”  That same year, DARPA began funding efforts to create “multiagent synthetic DNA vaccines” that would be delivered into the human body via “noninvasive electroporation” and was quickly promoted in media reports as a way to quickly produce vaccines compared to traditional vaccine production methods. This category of vaccine would involve the same type of synthetic DNA that DARPA was also simultaneously researching for the purposes of both “enhancing” and “subverting” human beings at the genetic level. It was also this year, 2010, that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation also began heavily funding DNA and RNA vaccines.  DNA vaccines, which were first created in 2005, have never been approved for human use in the United States and past studies have warned that they “possess significant unpredictability and a number of inherent harmful potential hazards” and that “there is inadequate knowledge to define either the probability of unintended events or the consequences of genetic modifications.” Another longstanding issue with such vaccines is mitigating “unwanted immune reactions” that result from natural immune response to the foreign genetic material they contain.  In 2011, DARPA announced its “Rapidly Adaptable Nanotherapeutics” program, which seeks to create a “platform capable of rapidly synthesizing therapeutic nanoparticles” aimed at combating “evolving and even genetically engineered bioweapons.” DARPA’s plan for these nanoparticles, which media reports described merely as “tiny, autonomous drug delivery systems,” was to combine them with “small interfering RNA (siRNA),” which are snippets of RNA that can target and shut down specific genes. As Wired wrote at the time: “siRNA could be reprogrammed ‘on-the-fly’ and applied to different pathogens,” allowing nanoparticles to “be loaded up with the right siRNA molecules and sent directly to cells responsible for the infection.”  The creation of this program was shortly followed by DARPA’s decision in 2013 to fund Moderna Therapeutics to the tune of $25 million to develop their synthetic RNA vaccine production platform. DARPA funded the project to “develop platform technologies that can be deployed safely and rapidly to provide the U.S. population with near-immediate protection against emerging infectious diseases and engineered biological weapons.”  Then, in 2015, DARPA’s research into vaccines involving synthetic antibodies and synthetic genetic material expanded, with them giving $45 million to the DNA vaccine company, Inovio Pharmaceuticals. This same year, DARPA-funded RNA and DNA vaccines began to be framed differently by both DARPA researchers and the media – who described the technology as transforming the human body into a “bio-reactor.”  In the years since, DARPA-backed DNA and RNA vaccine companies, including Moderna, Inovio as well as Germany’s CureVac, have been unable to get their products licensed for human use, largely due to the fact that their vaccines have failed to provide sufficient immunity in human trials. Examples of these ineffective vaccines include CureVac’s attempt at a rabies vaccine and Moderna’s efforts to create a vaccine for the Zika virus (which was funded by the U.S. government).  Several workarounds for this issue have been proposed, including vaccines where the genetic material (RNA or DNA) “self-amplifies.” However, the workaround of choice to this lack of immune response and other obstacles for DNA/RNA vaccines is the incorporation of nanotechnology into these vaccines. As a result, the use of nanoparticles as the carriers for the genetic material in these vaccines has been widely promoted and studied, as well as touted as the best way to improve their stability, increase their targeted delivery ability and enhance the immune response they provoke.  The combination of DNA or RNA vaccines with nanotechnology has already become reality thanks to the companies leading that field. For instance, the DARPA-backed DNA vaccine company Inovio Pharmaceuticals utilizes what reports refer to as “DNA nanotechnology” in their line of synthetic vaccines branded as “SynCon” by the company, which uses an undisclosed computer algorithm to design its vaccines. It is an interesting coincidence, then, that the Inovio “SynCon” vaccine for Covid-19 now appears to be ahead of the rest of the pack, with backing from Bill Gates, DARPA, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and other government agencies.  DARPA – Saving us from Covid-19?  In January, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced it would begin funding vaccine candidates for the coronavirus outbreak, long before it became a major global issue. CEPI describes itself as “a partnership of public, private, philanthropic and civil organizations that will finance and co-ordinate the development of vaccines against high priority public health threats” and was founded in 2017 by the governments of Norway and India along with the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. That month, CEPI only chose two pharmaceutical companies to receive funding for their efforts to develop a vaccine for Covid-19 – Moderna and Inovio Pharmaceuticals.  As previously mentioned, these two companies are DARPA-backed firms that frequently tout their “strategic alliance” with DARPA in press releases and on their websites. DARPA has also provided these companies with significant amounts of funding. For instance, the top funders behind Inovio Pharmaceuticals include both DARPA and the Pentagon’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the company has received millions in dollars in grants from DARPA, including a $45 million grant to develop a vaccine for Ebola. They were also recently awarded over $8 million from the U.S. military to develop a small, portable intradermal device for delivering DNA vaccines, which was jointly developed by Inovio and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), which also manages the “biodefense” lab at Fort Detrick.  In addition, the German company CureVac, which is also developing a CEPI-backed RNA vaccine for Covid-19, is another long-time recipient of DARPA funding. They were one of DARPA’s earliest investments in the technology, winning a $33.1 million DARPA contract to develop their “RNActive” vaccine platform in 2011.  In Moderna’s case, DARPA financed the production and development of their RNA vaccine production platform and their RNA therapy candidate for Chikungunya virus (their first for an infectious disease) was developed in direct collaboration with the agency. Since 2016, Moderna’s RNA vaccine program has received $100 million in funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The Gates Foundation has since poured millions directly into both Moderna’s and Inovio’s Covid-19 vaccine efforts.  Gates’ backing of DNA and RNA vaccines is significant, given that Gates – a billionaire with unparalleled influence and control over global healthcare policy – recently asserted that the best options for a Covid-19 vaccine are these same vaccines, despite the fact that they have never before been approved for use in humans. Yet, thanks to the emergency authorizations activated due to the current crisis, both Moderna’s and Inovio’s testing for these vaccines has skipped animal trials and gone straight to human testing. They are also set to be fast-tracked for widespread use in a matter of months. Moderna’s clinical trial in humans began in mid-March, followed by Inovio’s in the beginning of April. Thus, they are not only Gates’ favorites to be the new vaccine, but are also slated to be the first to complete clinical trials and garner emergency U.S. government approval, especially Moderna’s vaccine which is being jointly developed with the government’s NIH.  The rapid rise to prominence of Moderna’s and Inovio’s Covid-19 vaccines has resulted in several media articles praising DARPA as having provided our “best hope” for thwarting the coronavirus crisis. In addition to its backing of Moderna’s and Inovio’s own efforts, DARPA itself, specifically DARPA’s BTO, is set to have a “temporary” vaccine for Covid-19 available in a matter of weeks that will involve the production of synthetic antibodies that would ostensibly provide immunity for a few months until a longer-lasting vaccine (such as those produced by Moderna and Inovio) is available.  DARPA’s antibody treatment for Covid-19 is pursuing two routes, including the “human body as bio-reactor” approach that would involve synthetic DNA or RNA being injected in order to prompt the body to produce the necessary antibodies. Defense One notes that DARPA’s Covid-19 treatment would utilize techniques that had resulted from the agency’s investments in microfluidics (the manipulation of liquids at the sub-millimeter range), nanotechnology fabrication and “new approaches to gene sequencing.”   Persistent Concerns  While most media reports have painted these DARPA-led efforts as entirely positive, it is worth noting that concerns have been raised, though these concerns have hardly gotten the coverage they warrant. For instance, Nature recently noted some key points regarding safety issues related to the race for a Covid-19 vaccine, including the fact that all “previous coronavirus vaccines have not all proven appropriate or even safe,” with some past attempts at coronavirus vaccines having resulted in antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). ADE results in cells more rapidly taking up the virus and speeding up the virus’ replication, increasing its infectiousness and virulence.  Nature also noted that the two coronavirus vaccines for SARS that managed to pass phase 1 trials ended up, in subsequent studies, causing immune hypersensitivity in mice “resulting in severe immunopathology,” i.e. permanent defects or malfunctions in the immune system. In addition, Nature also pointed out that it is unknown how strong an immune response is needed to confer immunity for Covid-19 and coronaviruses in general, making it incredibly difficult to gauge if a vaccine is even effective.  Another issue worth noting involves concerns raised about Inovio Pharmaceuticals by investment research firm Citron Research, which compared Inovio to Theranos, the disgraced medical technology company that had initially promised to offer diagnoses for numerous diseases via a simple blood test, but was later revealed to be a sham. Citron asserted that “It’s been over 40 years since Inovio was founded, yet the company has NEVER [sic] brought a product to market, and all the while insiders have enriched themselves with hefty salaries and large stock sales.”  Citron Research went on to say that the company’s claim to have designed their Covid-19 vaccine in only 3 hours based on a computer algorithm was hard to believe, stating that “Inovio has a ‘computer algorithm’ that no one else in the world has and is arguably one of the greatest breakthroughs in vaccine discovery in the past 100 years, and yet this ‘computer algorithm’ is not mentioned once in any of its 10-K’s or 10-Q’s? Sounds like Theranos to us.” It also noted that Inovio’s partnerships with pharmaceutical companies Roche and AstraZeneca ended up failing with those two companies canceling the partnership despite claims from Inovio’s CEO that whey would “continue to thrive.”   A Not-So-Hidden Agenda  Of course, these are just concerns focused on corporate behavior and obstacles towards making a Covid-19 vaccine in general. As this report has already shown in detail, DARPA’s other experiments with the same technologies (particularly genetic engineering, synthetic chromosomes, and nanotechnology) that are being used to produce RNA and DNA vaccines for Covid-19 are arguably more concerning. This is especially true given that DARPA-backed companies that describe themselves as “strategic partners” of the agency are those manufacturing these vaccines. In addition, thanks to backing from the U.S. government and Bill Gate, among others, they are are also slated to be among the first vaccines (if not the first) approved for widespread use.  It is certainly troubling that media coverage of DARPA’s efforts and the efforts of Moderna and Inovio have thus far not included critical reporting regarding the different branches of DARPA’s research that has produced the technology involved in creating these vaccines, leaving little room for public scrutiny of their safety, efficacy and their potential for unintended effects on human genetics.  This is particularly alarming given that, over the past several weeks, efforts have been taking shape in many countries to enforce mandatory vaccinations once a Covid-19 vaccine becomes available. In some countries, it appears likely that the Covid-19 vaccine will not be made mandatory per say, but will be required for those who wish to return to any semblance of “normalcy” in terms of public gatherings, working certain jobs, leaving one’s home for longer periods of time and so on.  Would those involved in creating such a mandatory vaccine, e.g. DARPA, pass up the opportunity to utilize the same technologies involved in producing the vaccine for some of their other admitted goals? This question, of course, has no obvious answer, but the fact that the arc of DARPA’s research is aimed at the weaponization of human biology and genetics in a way that is ripe for misuse, suggests very worrying possibilities that warrant scrutiny. Indeed, if one merely looks at how the crisis has been a boon for the Orwellian plans of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) and the federal government’s current efforts to dramatically increase its powers amid the current crisis, it becomes increasingly difficult to give government agencies like DARPA and their corporate partners like Moderna and Inovio the benefit of the doubt.  This is especially true given that – without a major crisis such as that currently dominating world events – people would likely be unreceptive to the widespread introduction of many of the technologies DARPA has been developing, whether their push to create cyborg “super soldiers” or injectable BMIs with the capability to control one’s thoughts. Yet, amid the current crisis, many of these same technologies are being sold to the public as “healthcare,” a tactic DARPA often uses. As the panic and fear regarding the virus continues to build and as people become increasingly desperate to return to any semblance of normalcy, millions will willingly take a vaccine, regardless of any government-mandated vaccination program. Those who are fearful and desperate will not care that the vaccine may include nanotechnology or have the potential to genetically modify and re-program their very being, as they will only want the current crisis that has upended the world to stop.  In this context, the current coronavirus crisis appears to be the perfect storm that will allow DARPA’s dystopian vision to take hold and burst forth from the darkest recesses of the Pentagon into full public view. However, DARPA’s transhumanist vision for the military and for humanity presents an unprecedented threat, not just to human freedom, but an existential threat to human existence and the building blocks of biology itself.

On March 12, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao charged in a tweet: “It might be [the] US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan.” He retweeted an article that claimed, without evidence, that U.S. troops might have spread the virus when they attended the World Military Games in Wuhan in October 2019.  A competing theory has been gathering momentum - of an accidental lab release of bat coronavirus...  Less than 300 yards from the seafood market is the Wuhan branch of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Researchers from that facility and the nearby Wuhan Institute of Virology have posted articles about collecting bat coronaviruses from around China, for study to prevent future illness. Did one of those samples leak, or was hazardous waste deposited in a place where it could spread? Richard Ebright, a Rutgers microbiologist and biosafety expert, told me in an email that “the first human infection could have occurred as a natural accident,” with the virus passing from bat to human, possibly through another animal. But Ebright cautioned that it “also could have occurred as a laboratory accident, with, for example, an accidental infection of a laboratory worker.” He noted that bat coronaviruses were studied in Wuhan at Biosafety Level 2, “which provides only minimal protection,” compared with the top BSL-4. Ebright described a December video from the Wuhan CDC that shows staffers “collecting bat coronaviruses with inadequate [personal protective equipment] and unsafe operational practices.” Separately, I reviewed two Chinese articles, from 2017 and 2019, describing the heroics of Wuhan CDC researcher Tian Junhua, who while capturing bats in a cave “forgot to take protective measures” so that “bat urine dripped from the top of his head like raindrops.”  Ignatius unapologetically admits that what's increasingly clear is that the initial “origin story” - that the virus was spread by people who ate contaminated animals at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan - is shaky.   \"Shaky\" indeed, David!

Spearheaded by councilor Paul Funnell, the motion was passed on April 14.  In addition to severing the ties Wagga Wagga had with Kunming—which were in place since 1988—Funnell also called to sever relationships with two other friendship cities, Tieling in Liaoning province, and Rugao in Jiangsu province, which started in 2012 and 2014 respectively.  “Given that these current arrangements are actually with the governing and ruling authorities of the said provinces and educational facilities, we are therefore in relations with the totalitarian communist regime of the People’s Republic of China,” Funnell said in his report (pdf) to Wagga Wagga Council.  “This is the same Chinese communist government that delights in lies, subterfuge, and coverups; for example, by now trying to claim that the U.S. military is responsible for the spread of COVID-19,” said Funnel in the report.  Funnell added that the Chinese regime’s actions and inaction post the outbreak has “brought death and destruction across the world … and Wagga Wagga LGA (Local Government Area) has not been spared.”  According to NSW Health, the Murrumbidgee Local Health District in southern NSW—which includes Wagga Wagga and surrounding areas—has 44 reported cases of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus, commonly known as novel coronavirus. There has been one reported death as of April 15.  Mayor Greg Conkey issued a statement the next day saying that he immediately put forward a rescission motion to be considered at the next council meeting, which is scheduled for April 22.  “It’s hypocrisy,” Conkey told SBS News. “The three councilors who voted in favour of it either directly or indirectly benefit from our very close trading ties with China.”  “It’s all very well for them to say they’re opposed to the central government, but that has nothing to do with our sister city and the strong friendship and ties we have with them.  “We are a very proud multicultural city, we have 112 nationalities represented, and we speak 107 languages, so I’m really just devastated by this,” Conkey added.   Request From Sister City  According to Funnell, the city of Wagga Wagga received a letter from Kunming’s municipal government on Jan. 29 requesting face masks and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as China was “under a severe situation of preventing and controlling pneumonia.”  Funnell told 3AW radio host Tom Elliott that one week later, the city received another letter from Kunming that praised the Chinese regime’s victory over the CCP virus.  According to Funnell, the letter stated: “After confirming China’s victory over the epidemic, I will invite you to lead a delegation to show you a healthy, prosperous, and vibrant Kunming.”  “I’ve never supported the communist regime, and never will. And I don’t want to be in a relationship with the communist regime,” Funnell said.  Funnell added that he has been accused of racism but has made it clear that it’s not about race but rather the communist ideology.  “The beauty of our democratic process is that we can and should put forward what we believe are not only in the best interests of our constituents, but also an opportunity to stand up for our principles, and that of the people that chose us to represent them,” Funnell said in his report.  “If we don’t sever ties with the aforementioned anti-democratic organisations, we are giving tacit approval to the [Chinese] regime that what they are doing is alright, just by our ongoing relationship,” he said.  Six out of nine councilors were present to vote at the meeting. Of the three who were not there, one was ill and two declared a conflict of interest.

Tom Cotton (R-AR) appeared on Fox News with host Maria Bartiromo where he discussed China’s culpability in the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as his belief that the United States should “take a very hard look at” issuing visas for Chinese nationals studying science and technology.  Bartiromo asked Cotton about the Chinese Communist Party’s theft of U.S. intellectual property “that has been going on for decades,” and if he believes the CCP is stealing IP even during the pandemic in order to “save face” and develop a vaccine before the rest of the world.  Cotton replied, first stating that the CCP wouldn’t stop the theft of intellectual property, and that there are “active cases against Chinese nationals” throughout the U.S. pertaining to such theft.  In the middle of the pandemic, what’s the most valuable intellectual property in the world? It’s the research that our great laboratories and life science companies are doing on prophylactic drugs, therapeutic drugs, and ultimately a vaccine. So, I have little doubt that the Chinese intelligence services are actively trying to steal America’s intellectual property as it relates to the virus that they unleashed on the world because, of course, they want to be the country that claims credit for finding those drugs or finding a vaccine, and then use it as leverage against the rest of the world.  Bartiromo then asked the senator to explain his position on reevaluating the issuance of visas to “Chinese students who want to study advanced sciences.”  Cotton responded, saying that “it’s a scandal to me that we have trained so many of the Chinese Communist Party’s brightest minds to go back to China, to compete for our jobs, to take our business, and ultimately to steal our property, and design weapons and other devices that can be used against the American people.”  So, I think we need to take a very hard look at the visas that we give to Chinese nationals to come to the United States to study, especially at the postgraduate level in advanced scientific and technological fields.  He said that if Chinese nationals want to “study Shakespeare and the Federalist Papers,” that’s fine, but not “quantum computing and artificial intelligence.”  In 2019, CNN published a major story about the Chinese Communist Party using students studying abroad in the United States “as a form of espionage.”  In 2015, “at the direction of a high-level Chinese intelligence official,” a Chinese student named Ji Chaoqun sent an email titled “midterm test questions” to a Chinese national.  However, the email didn’t relate to school at all. Ji had “allegedly attached background reports on eight US-based individuals who Beijing could target for potential recruitment as spies, according to a federal criminal complaint.”  Ji was arrested in September 2018. A Justice Department statement reads in part: “The complaint charges Ji with one count of knowingly acting in the United States as an agent of a foreign government without prior notification to the Attorney General.” The statement makes sure to note that Ji is innocent until proven guilty.  Ji was indicted by a grand jury in January.  The CNN story includes a quote from a World Wide Threat Assessment from the U.S. intelligence community stating that “China’s intelligence services will exploit the openness of American society, especially academia and the scientific community, using a variety of means.”  Also quoted is William Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, who said that while nearly all of the approximately 350,000 Chinese students admitted to U.S. universities are there for legitimate purposes, our “liberal visa policy” could be “used by the Chinese government to facilitate nefarious activity here.”  The issue of Chinese students being coerced or recruited by the CCP to act as information funnels is a daunting one for United States, notes the CNN report.  NBC News reports that in January, two individuals were arrested with ties to China:  …the chairman of Harvard’s chemistry department was arrested by FBI agents in his office, charged with lying about a lucrative relationship with a Chinese talent recruitment program. The same day, a former Boston University student was accused of visa fraud after she allegedly failed to disclose her status as a lieutenant in the People’s Liberation Army.  The story continues, listing four other instances of arrests for various alleged crimes, including a “Chinese scholar at the University of California, Los Angeles” who “was convicted in June of shipping banned missile technology to his homeland.”  Despite requests from the “FBI and other agencies” to better police policies that might lead to these kinds of breaches, some university faculty, as well as lawmakers and others have pushed back, claiming, among other things, that such policies could engender racism and create unpleasant situations.  The report cites an instance in which a Chinese professor was allegedly accused of spying, but it was later revealed to be a “misunderstanding.” The professor reportedly spoke at a panel where he “choked up as he recalled being taken out of his house in handcuffs in front of his children by FBI agents.”  The Daily Wire, headed by bestselling author and popular podcast host Ben Shapiro, is a leading provider of conservative news, cutting through the mainstream media’s rhetoric to provide readers the most important, relevant, and engaging stories of the day.

A statement from a staff member said he was in quarantine but remained asymptomatic.  As US senators work on a multi-trillion-dollar rescue package to help the US economy hit hard by the pandemic, Paul has at least twice voted against such emergency funding.  Paul, who is 57, is the third member of Congress known to have contracted the virus. Two members of the House of Representatives — Ben McAdams of Utah and Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida — earlier announced positive tests.  Paul, the junior senator from Kentucky, “is feeling fine and is in quarantine. He is asymptomatic and was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events,” said the statement from his staff.  It said Paul was not aware of any direct contact with an infected person. It added that the senator’s Washington office had begun operating remotely 10 days ago, so “virtually no staff has had contact with Senator Paul.”  It was not clear exactly when he was tested.  On Wednesday, Paul voted against a $100 billion stimulus package designed to combat the virus.  The bill, which passed by a 90-8 vote, called for free virus testing and paid sick leave for some displaced workers.  The senator, a deficit hawk, argued that Congress should pay for the measure by cutting funding for wars or other “frivolous” programs, the Louisville, Kentucky Courier-Journal reported.  He urged his colleagues to “stop being a rubber stamp for wasteful spending.”  Earlier in the month, he opposed a bipartisan $8 billion plan for emergency coronavirus funding.

Hundreds of people gathered on the lawn at Washington Square on Saturday — some keeping further apart than others — to express their discontent with how the American government is handling the spread of the novel coronavirus and the restrictions that have come along with it.  “I can’t abide the idea of the government deciding what is good for me and my family,” said Ashlee Jessen, who drove from Provo to join the first Utah Business Revival rally in the state. The stay-at-home mom was holding a poster that said, “Give me liberty or give me death.”  “I believe liberty is worth dying for,” she said.  The first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Utah on March 6. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert asked Utahns to limit unnecessary trips and stay home as much as possible before he issued his “stay safe, stay home” directive on March 26. He has closed “nonessential businesses” and restricted restaurants and food establishments to only facilitate carry-out or delivery orders. On Monday, Herbert extended those restrictions to May 1.  Salt Lake County has been stricter on restrictions, even issuing quarantine restrictions prior to the governor’s directive. And, Salt Lake City, which has had the most confirmed cases and deaths resulting from COVID-19 in the state, has also been tight on its stay-at-home recommendations.  Eric Moutsos, of St. George, said he organized Saturday’s effort to “flood the city” with people who would ultimately purchase their dinner from local businesses. He thinks government has overstepped with all the restrictions that have been imposed on people due to the projected spread of disease.  “We’ve gone through so much worse in the United States of America,” Moutsos said, who wants to deliver a message of hope to business owners whose livelihood is temporarily on hold and out-of-work employees who need help. “We’re going to be OK. We are ready to go back to work immediately.”  Grid View A protester wears a President Donald Trump costume as Utahns rally against a state stay-at-home request at the City-County Building in Salt Lake City on Saturday, April 18, 2020.

Moutsos, a former police officer, said he’s afraid a growing unemployment rate will result in more people taking their own lives, which, he said, “is something we can’t let happen.”  Amy Garner, of American Fork, said her brother died by suicide in 2017 — two months after he lost his business.  “That pain is terrible,” she said, adding that she knows others are hurting now in the same ways.  Following her brother’s death, Garner learned that depression often stems from a loss of connection, including people, hobbies and meaningful work. She said the current restrictions are taking all three from most people, which could pose more risk than COVID-19.  “We should all have the agency to choose how healthy we want to be,” Garner said. “If this doesn’t end now, where is the line drawn.”  The crowd was bigger than organizers anticipated, Moutsos, who was handing out printed copies of the U.S. Constitution, said. A steady stream of cars traveling the four adjacent roads were also carrying American flags, honking and joining in the fray.  “People were patient when this first hit and we’ve given it the time we needed to figure it out. We needed to allow the hospitals to gear up. But we’ve seen the data now and it needs to stop,” said Rob Joseph, also a former Salt Lake City police officer who now helps run Club Echo.  He said he gets a call every day from one of his 57 employees who is struggling to make ends meet and he doesn’t believe the government is doing what it can to help them, despite imposing the restrictions that it has.  “I’m making educated decisions,” Garner said, adding that everyone in her family has been taking extra vitamin C since before cases of the virus were reported in Utah. Her young children were also holding signs they made, stating: “Open our parks” and “I miss my friends.”  “It feels good to know we aren’t alone,” Garner said.  The Utah Business Revival is planning another rally in Vineyard on May 2, where Moutsos said local businesses are invited to set up booths to bring in some much needed money during this difficult time.

The group asked county officials to identify a threshold in “unambiguous, quantitative terms” for the frequency of testing needed “to safely reopen schools and most businesses in our county,” the letter said.  But Smith said that while officials are aiming to increase the daily testing across the county to 3,000 or 4,000 per day, it would be incorrect to pin hopes on testing numbers because many layered decisions must be made before shelter-in-place rules can be relaxed.  “It’s not really that you get to a certain number and suddenly everything gets opened up again; it’s not a single target,” Smith said.  Smith also noted that the shortage of testing is “frustrating” because it’s a problem grounded in a lack of national and international preparedness for a pandemic of this scale, so there are supply bottlenecks for test kits and chemicals as “everyone and their brother” is trying to obtain them.  “So right now we’re at a point where, we’re clearly as a state — and basically all the states — behind the eight ball in the sense of wanting to have more testing capacity than what’s actually available,” he said.  The mayors on the letter — including Sam Liccardo of San Jose, Rich Tran of Milpitas, and Larry Klein of Sunnyvale — offered their cities’ staff time to support the county and asked county officials to consider forming a testing “task force,” similar to one Gov. Gavin Newsom announced.  They also requested the county “make a comprehensive list of testing sites available to the public, including a description of the specific tests offered,” and “identify the number of persons sufficient to deploy ample contact-tracing teams for a safe reopening of the economy.”  Smith said those kinds of considerations have been under discussion for weeks at the county level but said it will take more than just a certain number of tests and a certain number of contact tracers to address the issue.  As testing ramps up, he estimates about 600 people would need to be dedicated to the task, working full time after undergoing “significant training” to contact trace throughout the county.  He also said there would need to be a major network of support services and resources available to help people affected by possible quarantine mandates, to ensure they have safe places to stay and that their families have enough food and supplies.  “We’re setting up the process right now of identifying that, and certainly the cities and their efforts would be more than welcome in order to make that happen,” he said.  “Once we transition to contact tracing, it’s much more detailed work with a much longer timeline than everybody would like. It’ll take a lot of effort and a lot of patience in order to accomplish what needs to happen, so although we would like to have a trigger that says once we’ve done X,Y,Z, it’s done, it’s not going to be like that,” Smith said.  “We’re going to be dealing with COVID for the next many, many months, in my opinion, two or three years. We’ll just get better at dealing with it,” he added.  Related Articles Need a Covid-19 nurse?

All I can say is that’s not the way pandemics work.

GEORGE — As part of a series of moves by state, local and religious institutions Thursday to deal preemptively with COVID-19, Gov. Gary Herbert made an announcement recommending that people restrict the size of gatherings across Utah.  Herbert said gatherings of 100 people or more in the state are recommended to be avoided starting Monday, and those aged 60 and over are recommended to avoid any gatherings of more than 20 people.  During the press conference, Herbert echoed what most public officials are saying in regard to social interaction restrictions: They are in place to get ahead of the spread of the virus in a state that has yet to see a case.  “We are hoping for the best, preparing for the worst,” Herbert said. “I’ve not come to these decisions lightly. This is seeing what has happened in the last week with science. We’re trying to be proactive to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.”  Herbert said the restrictions are for the next two weeks, at which time the restrictions will be reviewed.  Measures were also announced at the press conference concerning educational institutions. There has been no statewide closure as of yet for K-12 schools, but many higher education universities have moved to online classes only.  David Heaton, spokesperson for the Southwest Utah Public Health Department, told St. George News those restrictions will apply in Southern Utah, especially to religious institutions and concert venues.  “This will be for any gathering over 100, and that would include most church gatherings and concerts,” Heaton said. “We consider Herbert’s pronouncement to be effective for us, so that would mean no mass gathering.”  Heaton added that since the restrictions don’t start until Monday, concerts and church services should be unrestricted for this weekend.  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints took their own preemptive action Thursday afternoon, announcing all services and gatherings worldwide have been suspended.  Among the local entertainment events this weekend are concerts at the 1,920-seat Tuacahn Amphitheater in Ivins.  Tuacahn announced Thursday afternoon that the Joan Jett and the Blackhearts concert, scheduled for Friday night at the amphitheater, has been canceled at the request of the artist. A Saturday night show by Air Supply is still scheduled, as Tuacahn officials said the artist would like to continue with the show.  “My understanding is any planned concerts and gatherings through Sunday evening are still allowed,” Heaton said.  Another event that will not take place is the annual St. George Arts Festival in Town Square Park. The festival announced Thursday that the event, which was scheduled for April 10-11, has been canceled in response to COVID-19 prevention.  Local sports are also being affected, with high school athletics throughout Utah being temporarily suspended. Dixie State University and Southern Utah University also had their postseason entries in the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament canceled.  The change has also strongly affected local nursing homes. The Utah Health Association, which governs nursing home and elderly care facilities, placed a new restriction Thursday that allows only medical personnel to visit residents in their homes. That means even families of residents are restricted from visiting their loved ones.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stated that those most susceptible to the virus are people aged 60 and over. The World Health Organization has said the fatality rate among those 80 and older infected with the virus is 18%.  At the Seasons Health and Rehab Center in St. George, relatives of patients had to be turned away. Even all medical personnel and staff had to pass a body temperature check at the door before being allowed to enter.  Jeremy Frehner, Seasons’ administrator, emphasized the restrictions are preemptive, and there are no signs of infection among their patients.  “We’ve asked families to stay away from social visits. This is just the state of things,” Frehner said. We’re not here to be fear mongers, we’re just here to protect these lovely people we’re protecting. If all the facilities in town haven’t done this, they will too be compliant.”  St. George News confirmed that other nursing homes in the area have either restricted visitors or were in the process of doing so Thursday afternoon, including Bella Terra and Red Cliffs Health in St. George. Hurricane Health and Rehabilitation is only allowing visitors on a case-by-case basis while, as of Thursday evening, Brookdale in Cedar City is still allowing visitors.  Of the 36 deaths caused by COVID-19 nationwide, 23 are linked to one nursing home in Washington state, according to the CDC. That is one of the reasons to take preemptive action, Frehner said.  “This is not the worst-case scenario. We’re being proactive,” Frehner said, who added the staff of his and other nursing care facilities are prepared for this type of situation. “People here are steady and strong and understand the implications of what’s going on. They’re vetted for this situation.”  Also taking preemptive action are local cities.  The city of St. George announced Thursday it is taking additional hygienic measures at City Hall, the St. George Recreation Center, the Sand Hollow Aquatic Center and SunTran city buses. It is unclear what the status of the aquatic center and other large gathering places will be after the state restrictions begin Monday.  Washington City released a statement Thursday saying it will be initiating some changes or restrictions in the coming days on certain uses at the Washington City Community Center and pool as well as other public areas.  Earlier this week, signs were placed at Ivins City Hall notifying visitors that they won’t receive handshakes from city workers and officials.  “We don’t want to offend anybody, we’re just trying to be proactive,” Ivins City Manager Dale Coulam said.  On the medical side, Utah health officials said the state is currently testing around 60 people statewide for the virus each day and are building capacity to do up to 1,000 per day. They also said Intermountain Healthcare is opening two drive-thru testing sites in Salt Lake City.  Heaton said at this point, local sites, including Dixie Regional Medical Center, are capable of testing patients for the virus, though at this point those tests are being sent to Salt Lake City. Heaton added steps are underway to provide more localized testing, though he had no further details at this time.  Intermountain Healthcare announced Thursday it is making changes to its emergency room intake procedures systemwide including at DRMC and Cedar City Hospital. At the same time, Intermountain officials urged all residents throughout the state to opt for the emergency room only if they are feeling the most severe symptoms.  Emergency rooms will have a separate area specifically for those complaining of respiratory issues, which will include negative pressure isolation rooms.  “We want you to come to the emergency department if you’re sick. The last thing we want to do is to bring healthy people into an unhealthy environment,” said Dr. Eddie Stenehjem, the medical director of antibiotic stewardship for Intermountain. “For those who have mild symptoms, we’re telling you: Stay home.”  Intermountain officials said patients should use online and Telehealth resources if they have mild symptoms, consult with their medical doctor or clinic if they have concerns, and opt for the ER only if they feel they absolutely need it.  Earlier in the week, Intermountain announced new visitor limits, and officials with the health group indicated Thursday that further restrictions are likely.  Herbert said during Thursday’s press conference that there are some areas where people are “overreacting.” For example, he said, there is no reason for people to stockpile water as the virus cannot be transmitted through water supplies.  With so many changes happening, seemingly on an hourly basis, the main message is to stay calm, but be vigilant.  “We don’t need fighting at Costco and Walmart,” Herbert said. “Tempers flaring is not the Utah way.”  There has yet to be a case of COVID-19 through community spread in the state, according to the Utah Department of Health. There have been five cases of people in Utah testing positive for the virus after travel, including Utah Jazz players Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell. Not counted in the total by state officials is one person who was visiting from out of state who tested positive and three Utahns who were infected aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, including a couple from St. George.  The state of Utah has set up a website to provide information on the new coronavirus as well as a hotline for those who suspect they may have the virus. The number for the hotline is 800-456-7707.  Those exhibiting symptoms are asked to call either their doctor or the hotline first before going into an emergency room or urgent care. The main symptoms of COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control, include fever, fatigue, body aches, cough and shortness of breath. Recent travel is an exacerbating factor.  The CDC said people will likely be tested for influenza first, as many of the symptoms are the same, and a flu diagnosis rules out COVID-19.  Coronavirus.utah.gov provides up-to-the-minute information on the spread of the virus in the state as well as educational information on how to prevent getting the virus and how to deal with it if you are infected. It also includes information for health care providers.  Health care providers evaluating a patient for suspected COVID-19 are asked to contact the Utah Department of Health immediately at 888-EPI-UTAH (374-8824).

I’m going to make an announcement tomorrow but I think for Florida, going from where we are now to phase one is not a very big leap,” said DeSantis.  Florida, with a high population of older Americans vulnerable to the disease, has long been a source of concern but the Trump ally promoted his state’s ability to test its citizens and rebuffed criticism about his response to the coronavirus pandemic.  Asked why he closed his state later than others did, DeSantis insisted Florida has fared better than states that put in place what he called “draconian orders.”   IF YOU FEEL SICK:  The Florida Department of Health has opened a 24-hour COVID-19 Call Center at 1-866-779-6121.

So why even employ her,' one person wrote on Facebook.  Meanwhile on Twitter, one person suggested that Sunrise change from two hosts to three hosts once Sam returns to the show.  'Hope Nat stays on as a main host. Have all three; Sam, Kochie and Nat,' they wrote.  'Only thing left to do now is get rid of Kochie and Nat Barr,' another person said on Facebook, radically suggesting Sunrise get a whole new lineup.

The order will use the Defense Production Act to classify meat processing as critical infrastructure to keep production plants open.  The order comes after industry leaders warned that consumers could see meat shortages in a matter of days after workers at major facilities tested positive for the virus. A senior White House official said the administration was working to prevent a situation in which a majority of processing plants shut down for a period of time, which could lead to an 80% drop in the availability of meat in supermarkets. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the order before its release.  Trump on Tuesday told reporters that “there’s plenty of supply,” but that supply chains had hit what he called a “road block. It’s sort of a legal roadblock more than anything else,\" he said.  Two of the nation’s biggest pork processing plants are currently closed. Meat processing giant Tyson Foods suspended operations at its plant in Waterloo, Iowa. And Smithfield Foods halted production at its plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The 15 largest pork-packing plants account for 60% of all pork processed in the country.  GOP Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota had written a letter to Trump asking him to use the DPA to declare the food supply industry an essential industry, warning that consumers would see a meat shortage in a matter of days akin to the panic over toilet paper the virus created in its early days.  Tyson ran a full-page advertisement in The New York Times and other newspapers Sunday outlining the difficulty of producing meat while keeping more than 100,000 workers safe and shutting some plants.  “As pork, beef and chicken plants are being forced to close, even for short periods of time, millions of pounds of meat will disappear from the supply chain,\" it read.  The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents 1.3 million food and retail workers, said last week that 13 U.S. food-processing and meatpacking union workers in the U.S. have died and that an estimated 5,000 are sick or have been exposed to the virus while working near someone who tested positive.  On Monday, community members from around the Shenandoah Valley  , where workers say their employers have not done enough to protect essential workers.   Hours later,  that an employee of their facility in Dayton had died of COVID-19.  Those developments came as Gov. Ralph Northam  , saying that the CDC would be deploying teams to Virginia facilities to evaluate conditions.  COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, has infected hundreds of workers at meat-processing plants and forced some of the largest to close and others to slow production. While the output at beef and poultry plants has diminished, pork plants in the Midwest have been hit especially hard. The viral outbreaks have persisted despite efforts by the meat companies to keep workers at home with pay if they become sick.

If you do not have a health care provider, call the nearest hospital.  Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for 20 seconds. If not available, use hand sanitizer.  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.  Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or upper sleeve when coughing or sneezing.  Avoid contact with people who are sick.  If you are sick, stay home, and avoid contact with others.  Stay at least 6 feet away from others when in a public setting.

Thanks, Cuomo, use the NY National Guard to keep the panic flowing.  The cluster of coronavirus cases in New Rochelle are believed to have come from a Synagogue in the city.  It’s one thing to order common sense mitigation procedures, and another to send in the National Guard. In New Rochelle, the governor is “minimizing” gatherings, closing schools, community centers, and houses of worship. He has assigned the New York National Guard to do the cleanup and deliver food to the residents. No panic there.   US News reported,  Beginning Thursday, all facilities within the containment radius will be closed for two weeks to allow for thorough cleaning and to assess the situation. The National Guard will be deployed to the containment area to assist in cleaning schools and delivering food to quarantined residents, Cuomo said.  “This can’t be a political decision. This is a public health decision,” Cuomo said. “When you politically intervene in science, that’s when you often make mistakes.”  There are differences between the COVID-19 virus and influenza, obviously. But the fear being generated by the left wing media, and politicians has grown out of proportion to reality, judging by people’s freaked out toilet paper purchasing frenzy. Is the National Guard the right answer for New Rochelle?  Dr. Drew Pinsky recently slammed the news media for their hype over the Coronavirus.  “What I have a problem with is the panic and the fact that businesses are getting destroyed, that people’s lives are being upended, not by the virus, but by the panic. The panic must stop. And the press, they really somehow need to be held accountable because they are hurting people…A bad flu season is 80,000 dead, we’ve got about 18,000 dead from influenza this year, we have a hundred from corona. Which should you be worried about, influenza or corona? A hundred versus 18,000? It’s not a trick question. And look, everything that’s going on with the New York cleaning the subways and everyone using Clorox wipes and get your flu shot, which should be the other message, that’s good. That’s a good thing, so I have no problem with the behaviors.” Dr Drew Pinsky in The Washington Examiner  A breakdown of the number of current cases state by state is at this link, although the numbers change moment by moment. For perspective, Lohud reported regarding New York in January 2020,  A whopping 74% spike in flu cases hit when friends and family gathered for the holidays, accounting for about 9,200 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza reported to the state Department of Health for the week ending Dec. 28. That brought the statewide total to nearly 22,800 cases for this season.  That was in January, 2020.  Cuomo has also decreed that if any student in the state of New York tests positive for COVID-19, that school will be closed for at least 24 hours. Did they need his jackboot response, or would they have taken care of the “mitigation” by following CDC guidelines? The presence of the National Guard smacks of something far more intimidating than a virus.

OKLAHOMA CITY (KFOR) – As some businesses across the state prepare to reopen to the public, health officials say Oklahoma’s coronavirus deaths have climbed to 179.  On Thursday morning, data from the Oklahoma State Department of Health shows that the state currently has 3,017 confirmed cases of COVID-19.  According to the data, that is about a 4% increase in the number of cases.   April 23rd  The cases are in the following counties:  Adair – 50 (3 deaths)   Alfalfa -1   Atoka -1   Beaver: 1   Beckham -2   Bryan -6 (1 death)   Caddo -53 (5 death)  Canadian – 86 (3 deaths)   Carter- 2   Cherokee -25 (1 death)   Choctaw -3   Cimarron – 1  Cleveland – 388 (26 deaths)  Comanche – 75 (1 death)   Cotton -5 (1 death)   Craig- 9  Creek – 71 (5 deaths)   Custer – 10   Delaware- 89 (9 deaths)   Dewey -2   Garfield -11 (1 death)   Garvin – 13   Grady- 31 (1 death)   Grant- 2   Greer -63 (6 deaths)   Harper – 1   Haskell – 3   Jackson -13   Jefferson – 2   Johnston -3  Kay – 47 (6 deaths)   Kingfisher -6   Kiowa -4   Latimer -4 (1 death)   Le Flore -8   Lincoln – 10   Logan- 11   Love -2   Major -2 (1 death)   Marshall – 2   Mayes- 19 (3 deaths)   McClain -28   McCurtain – 8   McIntosh – 2   Murray– 1   Muskogee -26 (4 deaths)   Noble -6   Nowata- 16   Okfuskee: 1  Oklahoma – 634 (25 deaths)   Okmulgee- 16  Osage – 68 (8 deaths)   Ottawa- 29  Pawnee – 28 (2 deaths)   Payne -40   Pittsburg- 22 (2 death)  Pontotoc – 10 (1 death)  Pottawatomie – 38 (4 deaths)   Rogers -44 (3 deaths)   Seminole -8 (1 death)  Sequoyah – 10 (2 deaths)  Stephens – 19 (1 death)   Texas -46 (1 deaths)   Tillman -1  Tulsa – 454 (26 deaths)  Wagoner – 112 (12 deaths)  Washington – 208 (13 deaths)   Woods-3   Woodward -2.  Officials also announced nine additional deaths from the virus:  A man and a woman in the 65 and older age group in Cleveland County  A man and a woman in the 65 and older age group in Washington County  A man in the 65 and older age group in Oklahoma County  A woman in the 50 to 64-year-old age group in Tulsa County  A man in the 65 and older age group in Creek County  A man in the 65 and older age group in Caddo County  A female in the 65 and older age group in Muskogee County.  Oklahoma State Department of Health  Authorities say six of those patients died in the past 24 hours and the others died between April 18 and April 21.  Officials with the Oklahoma State Department of Health tell KFOR that experts must gather several pieces of information in order to classify a death as related to COVID-19.  “We can have a death reported to us, but with missing information that we have to gather or the reporting entity can have a delay in reporting the info to OSDH as well. All that is to say, no one is artificially inflating or deflating any numbers, it is there are quite a few “boxes” to check before we can officially report a death attributed to Covid-19 and that process along with delays in reporting can mean that it’s not possible to officially report a death within 24 hours of that death occurring, although every effort is made to do so,” Shelley Zumwalt, with OMES and working on behalf of the Oklahoma State Department of Health, said in an email.  Medical workers at Kaiser Permanente French Campus test a patient for the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, at a drive-thru testing facility in San Francisco, California on March 12, 2020. – Between 70 to 150 million people in the United States could eventually be infected with the novel coronavirus, according to a projection shared with Congress, a lawmaker said March 12, 2020. (Photo by Josh Edelson / AFP) (Photo by JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images)  So far, officials say 179 Oklahoma patients have died and 622 people have been hospitalized. Currently, 284 patients are hospitalized.  According to health department data, officials believe 1,884 Oklahomans have recovered from the virus. Although the CDC recommends patients be tested twice to determine if they have recovered, health department officials say they are preserving tests for patients who are sick.  Instead, the Oklahoma State Department of Health identifies a person as recovered if they are currently not hospitalized or deceased and it has been 14 days since the onset of their symptoms or since they were diagnosed.  (Photo by Thomas Imo/Photothek via Getty Images)  State officials urge Oklahomans to stay away from ill patients and to frequently wash their hands. Also, avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.  At this point, Americans are urged to practice ‘social distancing’ by staying in their homes as much as possible and not going out into a crowd.  The virus is mainly spread from person-to-person, and symptoms usually appear two to 14 days after exposure. Officials stress that the most common symptoms are fever, cough, and shortness of breath.  If you do become sick, you are asked to stay away from others. If you have been in an area where the coronavirus is known to be spreading or been around a COVID-19 patient and develop symptoms, you are asked to call your doctor ahead of time and warn them that you might have been exposed to the virus.

The planned temporary shutdown of the 8,891 kilometer (5,525 mile) international boundary -- the longest in the world between two countries -- was jointly announced by Trudeau and Donald Trump the previous day.  \"We are continuing to work on the fine-tuning of the agreement between Canada (and) the United States, I think it's almost there,\" Trudeau told a news conference from his home where he and his family are self-isolating after his wife Sophie was diagnosed with the COVID-19 virus.  \"My understanding is that the measure will probably come into place in the night between Friday and Saturday, so in about a day and a half.\" Trump said Wednesday the Canada-US border would likely be reopened in \"say 30 days.\" \"Hopefully at the end of 30 days we'll be in great shape,\" he told reporters at the White House.  The move builds on the US president's barring of visitors from most of Europe, China and other parts of the world as the number of coronavirus cases in the US surged past 9,400, with 150 deaths.  In Canada, the number of cases has reached at least 772, with 10 deaths, according to public health officials.  \"What continues to concern us is the day by day sharp increasing (number of) cases, and the reports from provinces of new cases with no links to travel,\" chief public health officer Theresa Tam said.  Her deputy Howard Njoo, meanwhile, commented, \"Certainly from a public health perspective, we've always said that border measures alone won't stop the introduction of a virus into the country.\" Rather, he said, \"border measures are one component, one layer of a multi-layered system.\" More than $2 billion worth of goods and 400,000 people cross the Canada-US border each day.  \"Essential border crossings will not be impeded, trade between our two countries will not be impeded,\" Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said.  Trudeau also took the opportunity on Thursday to again urge Canadians to \"come home.\" An estimated 3 million Canadians live or work abroad.  \"All those having trouble coming back, I can tell you we are working hard to resolve that situation,\" he said, noting that he has spoken with the chief executives of Air Canada and WestJet to ask them to help facilitate the repatriation of Canadians.

The vast majority of Premier League players understand that they get paid a lot of money. Most are from working class backgrounds and are no different to anybody else.  We’ve already seen a number of individuals do their bit to help — whether that be through donating their money or time.  While we’ve read about how they are contributing, I’m sure there is a lot going on that we have not heard about.  Football is an easy target as it is a multi-million-pound industry but players don’t need people calling them out to do more.  Just because we don’t read it or see it being posted on social media does not mean players are doing nothing. But it makes complete sense that footballers are listening to advice and taking their time.  As an example, we have already seen David De Gea anonymously donate £270,000 to help tackle the coronavirus in Spain.  We see the work Marcus Rashford has done in helping to raise huge sums to help get food out to those deprived of a free school meal.  We have seen Jordan Henderson working behind the scenes trying to organise a Premier League fund that will raise millions of pounds for the NHS.  These are just three examples of the working going on — and there are countless more.

But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them? The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £1MILLION for NHS workers. The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need. We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid-19 Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it. The Sun is donating £50,000 and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM. No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here thesun.co.uk/whocareswinsappeal  But it is not a simple situation so it makes complete sense that footballers are listening to advice and taking their time.  Firstly, do they defer their wages, take a cut, or gift it?  Secondly, do they do it individually, alongside their clubs, or as a collective of players?  As we are now seeing, players rightly want to know that their money is going to the right place and with maximum impact.  It must also be remembered that everyone’s salaries vary.  I know they are all on massive wages but not everybody in the Premier League is a multi-millionaire. While footballers are far from the only wealthy people in the country, it is only right that they should help.  Furloughing was to help smaller businesses who are really going to be struggling. It was not designed to help companies who have made millions and millions of pounds over the last few years.  But in my experience, that was never in doubt and it’s wrong to single them out as a group for criticism without knowing all of the facts.  It was the same in my time as a player, when great work was constantly going on behind the scenes.  At times like this, most will be more than happy to help.  What doesn’t sit right though is how clubs are increasingly placing their staff on furlough leave.  I get it when the likes of Burnley come out and say that the uncertainty right now means they might run out of money by the end of the summer.  And it should also be said that what’s right for a club like Norwich is not the same for others.

That being said, many more are doing great things in their local communities right now.  And on top of that, we have seen the Premier League promise to advance £125million to the EFL and National League and give £20m towards the NHS.  Players have taken a bashing in some quarters but people need to understand it from their point of view.  We have already seen numerous examples of footballers going above and beyond.

Six of those, three Australians, two Filipinos and a Briton, have been taken off for treatment in the capital Montevideo.  Foreign Minister Ernesto Talvi said on Twitter that an agreement had been reached through 'intense conversations and very close cooperation with the Australian government.'  As for the European and American passengers on the Greg Mortimer, they must 'wait until they test negative' before organising their repatriation via Sao Paulo, Brazil, the ship's owner said.

The cruise ship's owner, Aurore Expeditions, has 'contracted a medical plane... to repatriate the Australian and New Zealander passengers,' Uruguay's foreign ministry said, adding that the plane had been given permission to arrive on Thursday.  Around 100 Australians are aboard, and negotiations were underway to allow the New Zealanders to fly with them, Aurore said.  It said that of those still on the ship, no-one was suffering from a fever.  The Airbus A340 plane contracted to fly the Aussies and Kiwis home 'is configured with medical facilities aboard... to look after the health and security of everyone,' said Aurore.

The plane will carry passengers who test both positive and negative for the virus.  It is due to arrive from Portugal and then fly on to Melbourne, after which all passengers will be required to spend two weeks in quarantine.  'Everybody wants to go home. It's not a nightmare but it's not the ideal situation,' Charley Nadin, 67, an Australian anaesthetist, told AFP by WhatsApp.  'There are a lot of people on board who've never been through any difficulties and this is pretty frightening for a lot of people.'  He and fellow Australian Maurice Clifford, 71, an orthopaedic surgeon, boarded the vessel in Ushuaia, in the far south of Argentina on March 14th.  They were due to travel to Antarctica, South Georgia and Elephant Island for the holiday of a lifetime.  But on 21 March with border closings and lockdowns in South America and Australia, the exploration was called off.  Some of those on the ship are keeping their spirits up despite the large numbers of passengers, mostly elderly people, to have fallen ill.  The plight of the Greg Mortimer is the latest affecting the global cruise industry, which has seen vessels refused entry to ports and others locked down after new-coronavirus cases were confirmed onboard during the pandemic.  The ship- named after an Australian mountaineer who scaled Mount Everest - set sail for the Falkland Islands but was denied entry there as authorities did not have the facilities to cope with COVID-19 cases.  The liner headed on to the only port along the Atlantic coast of South America still open, Montevideo.  Aerial view of Australian cruise ship Greg Mortimer off the port of Montevideo yesterday  Although the ship has been anchored in the Rio de la Plata about 15 miles off the port for the last week, health authorities from Montevideo have been aboard to help passengers.  Uruguay's Health Minister Daniel Salinas told AFP on Tuesday that the six being treated in private clinics in Montevideo were in a stable condition.  Two were in intensive care.  According to a doctor who boarded the ship, Sebastian Yancev, the high infection rate was due to mistakes made in isolation measures, including leaving people who had tested negative with those who were positive.  Yancev said Ushuaia was the likely source of the contagion.  Despite their ordeal, both Nadin and Clifford said they would like to come back, not just to finish their expedition but also to visit Montevideo.  'The health authorities in Montevideo have been incredibly good and there is nothing but praise from all of us... their humanity and care for all of us here has been extraordinary,' said Nadin.  'There's an irony there that we've been down there very carefully protecting the environment in Antarctica so we don't leave any bacteria or bugs down there and in the meantime we're spreading this disease amongst ourselves,' said Clifford.

The agency confirmed 44 new cases of the COVID-19 disease caused by the new coronavirus as at the end of March 7, a decline from 99 the previous day.  Chinese cities are gradually relaxing quarantine measures put in place over a month ago, while authorities keep a close watch on the virus’ spread overseas.  Of the 44 new confirmed cases, 41 were discovered in Wuhan, the origin of the virus’ outbreak and its hotbed.  The remaining three were cases imported from outside mainland China.  This marks the second consecutive day in which all of China’s newly confirmed cases outside of the city of Wuhan originated from overseas. The three cases bring China’s total imported case count to 63.  According to the Beijing Municipal Health Commission, two of the cases found in Beijing originated in Italy and Spain.  As the virus slows its spread in Wuhan, authorities have reacted by closing hospitals built specifically to house its patients.  After the first such closure last week, on Sunday, CCTV reported that operations at a second hospital had been suspended, with its 25 remaining patients now discharged and declared cured.

'We are the ones who transfer it to each other.'  WHO said about 3.4% of people infected with the COVID-19 virus globally have died, making it more lethal than the common flu. But that figure was met with skepticism, with scientists noting that large numbers of mild cases have probably gone undetected or unreported. A study last week in the New England Journal of Medicine of data from more than 30 Chinese provinces estimated the death rate at 1.4%.  In Daegu, the South Korean city at the center of that country's outbreak, a shortage of hospital space meant about 2,300 patients were being cared for in other facilities while they awaited a hospital bed. Prime Minister Chung Se-Kyun sought to assure his country, saying, 'We will win the war against COVID-19.'  South Korea reported 435 new infections Wednesday, down from 851 a day earlier. More than 5,600 people in South Korea have contracted the virus and 32 have died.  In Europe, officials told French soccer players to simply disperse \" without shaking hands \" after lining up, and referees and coaches will no longer shake hands either.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also urged people to adopt the Indian greeting of 'namaste,' with hands together, rather than a handshake.  Businesses of all types suffered a downturn as travel and tourism plummeted and worried consumers changed their habits.  'People are afraid to touch anything or take anything from us,' said Maedeh Jahangiri, a perfume seller at a mall in Tehran.

Now, some people were sick with this virus at that time, and they accidentally spread it to other people.

Many of the early SSEs, in fact, centered on weddings, birthday parties, and other events that were described in local media as glamorous or populated by “socialites.” … But absent more data, the more obvious explanation is that these early SSEs are linked to the intercontinental travel practices of the guests. … Moreover, COVID-19 outbreaks in poor communities are simply less likely to be reported, because the victims have less access to testing, high-end medical care, or media contacts.

But even that 70 percent figure underestimates the prevalence of these activities in COVID-19 SSEs, because my database also includes five SSEs involving two warships and three cruise ships—the USS Roosevelt, Charles de Gaulle, Diamond Princess, Grand Princess and Ruby Princess—at least three of which (and probably all five) featured onboard parties. These parties, funerals, religious meet-ups and business networking sessions all seem to have involved the same type of behaviour: extended, close-range, face-to-face conversation—typically in crowded, socially animated spaces. This includes the many people infected by a bartender while being served at a raucous après ski venue in Austria, and party guests in Brazil greeting “each other with two kisses on the cheek [a local custom], hugs and handshakes.” The funerals in question are generally described as highly intimate and congested scenes of grieving among close friends and relatives. In the case of the SSE funeral in Albany, Georgia that devastated the local population, “people wiped tears away, and embraced, and blew their noses, and belted out hymns. They laughed, remembering. It was a big gathering, with upward of 200 mourners overflowing the memorial chapel, so people had to stand outside.” With few exceptions, almost all of the SSEs took place indoors, where people tend to pack closer together in social situations, and where ventilation is poorer. (It is notable, for instance, that the notorious outbreak at an Austrian ski resort is connected to a bartender and not, say, a lift operator.) But generalizations in this area are complicated by the fact that some of the religious festivals described herein were mixed indoor/outdoor affairs. Moreover, the February 19 SSE at San Siro stadium in Milan is also ambiguous, since that stadium has a roof over the seating area, but not over the field.  I would imagine that supporters of the Bergamo soccer club tended to travel to the big game in Milan in buses and trains with other supporters, talking and perhaps singing excitedly at least one way. (If Bergamo won, then both ways.)  The media accounts of these SSEs are full of descriptions in this vein. At a February 15 festival in Gangelt, a town in Germany’s tiny Heinsberg district, “beer and wine flowed aplenty as approximately 350 adults in fancy dress locked arms on long wooden benches and swayed to the rhythm of music provided by a live band. During an interval in the programme, guests got up to mingle with friends and relatives at other tables, greeting each other as Rhineland tradition commands, with a bützchen, or peck on the cheek.” Since that time, more than 40 Germans from the Heinsberg district have died. It’s been called “Germany’s Wuhan.” In the case of religious SSEs, Sikhs, Christians, Jews and Muslims are all represented in the database. … Of the 54 SSEs for which underlying activities could be identified, only 11 did not involve either religious activity, a party, a funeral, a cruise or extended face-to-face professional networking. But even in this minority of cases, one can observe almost identical interpersonal dynamics. Three of the SSEs—in Japan, Skagit County, WA, and Singapore—involved concert-goers and singing groups belting out tunes together over a period of hours. (The Skagit example [a Presbyterian choir practice] is particularly interesting, because the organizers were aware of the COVID-19 risk beforehand, and took the precaution of spacing out the participants by several feet. If they had been merely chatting, instead of singing, no one might have gotten sick.) Another SSE involved a group of Canadian doctors engaged in a day of recreational curling. This is a sport that involves hyperventilating participants frenetically sweeping the ice with brooms while their faces are positioned inches apart, sometimes changing partners—an ideal climate for Flüggian infection. Indeed, this partner-swapping aspect of the activity seems to be a common feature of many suspected SSEs, such as square-dancing parties. Four of the SSEs were outbreaks at meat-processing plants, in which “gut snatchers” and other densely packed workers must communicate with one another amidst the ear-piercing shriek of industrial machinery. I lack the expertise to determine how the refrigerated nature of some meat-processing facilities may affect the dynamics of droplet transmission—though I would also note that at least four of the SSEs on my list unfolded at European ski resorts. But high levels of noise do seem to be a common feature of SSEs, as such environments force conversationalists to speak at extremely close range. (Related factors may be at play in old-age homes. These tend to be quiet places. But the reduced speaking volume and hearing functions of some elderly residents lend themselves to conversations held at much closer range than is socially typical in the general population.) Finally, three of the SSEs involved mass sports spectacles, during which fans regularly rain saliva in all directions as they communally celebrate or commiserate in response to each turn of fortune. (Advance to the 8:30 mark of this video, showing euphoric hometown fan reaction during the infamous February 19th football match between Atlanata and Valencia, and you will see exactly what I mean.) As we now know, the danger starts even before the action begins: One of the most dangerous things you can do at a sports event in the COVID-19 era is sing the national anthem. * * * When do COVID-19 SSEs happen? Based on the list I’ve assembled, the short answer is: Wherever and whenever people are up in each other’s faces, laughing, shouting, cheering, sobbing, singing, greeting, and praying.  “Humanist Conan, what is best in life?”  “Wherever and whenever people are up in each other’s faces, laughing, shouting, cheering, sobbing, singing, greeting, and praying.”  I imagine kissing should also be included in this list.  This is depressing. The accumulating evidence appears to be that most of the grimmer economic activities, outside of perhaps taking the NYC subway to work, aren’t all that dangerous, but the social activities that make getting and spending much more worth living are.  Basically, activities that a Boston Puritan minister of 1650 would have approved of, such as many forms of making money and listening attentively to his sermons, seem less dangerous, while the more dangerous activities are what we tend to think of as either fun or cathartic.  … It’s worth scanning all the myriad forms of common human activity that aren’t represented among these listed SSEs: watching movies in a theater, being on a train or bus, attending theater, opera, or symphony (these latter activities may seem like rarified examples, but they are important once you take stock of all those wealthy infectees who got sick in March, and consider that New York City is a major COVID-19 hot spot). These are activities where people often find themselves surrounded by strangers in densely packed rooms—as with all those above-described SSEs—but, crucially, where attendees also are expected to sit still and talk in hushed tones.  People are all tending to face in the same direction in these venues. And even during intermission, they mostly speak to the people they came with, not to random non-householders.  The world’s untold thousands of white-collar cubicle farms don’t seem to be generating abundant COVID-19 SSEs—despite the uneven quality of ventilation one finds in global workplaces. This category includes call centers (many of which are still operating), places where millions of people around the world literally talk for a living. (Addendum: there are at least two examples of call-centre-based clusters, both of which were indicated to me by readers after the original version of this article appeared—one in South Korea, which overlaps with the massive Shincheonji Church of Jesus cluster; and the other in Jamaica.) In New Zealand, one SSE centered on students at a girls’ school. Given the exuberant and socially intimate way in which children laugh, argue and gossip, I am surprised there are not more schools on my list. Moreover, I had trouble finding any SSEs that originated in university classrooms, which one would expect to be massive engines of infection if COVID-19 could be transmitted easily through airborne small-droplet diffusion. In the United States, the two university-based examples that have received the most media attention are Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va. and the University of Texas. But in neither case was there any apparent connection to classroom activity. At Liberty, where several employees got sick, the one student known to be infected isn’t even currently enrolled in classes. And the UT outbreak, which has caused more than 40 students to be infected, actually took place on a Spring Break trip to Mexico. It’s possible, I suppose, that these students spent the week holed up in a conference room with a stack of books. But my instincts indicate otherwise. It’s similarly notable that airplanes don’t seem to be common sites for known SSEs, notwithstanding the sardine-like manner in which airlines transport us and the ample opportunity that the industry’s bureaucracy offers for contact tracing. Yes, New Zealand has one cluster that’s based around an infected but asymptomatic flight attendant. But the many known infections he caused took place at a wedding reception, not in an airplane. … I’ve already cataloged the limitations of my approach at some length. And I will emphasize again that I am not an epidemiologist, virologist, or infectious-diseases expert (though I like to think I’ve made myself a somewhat educated reader of the most recently published scientific literature in these fields). But even a layperson can see that there is a fairly clear pattern in the most notorious, destructive, and widely reported cases of mass COVID-19 infection—virtually all of which feature forms of human behaviour that permit the direct ballistic delivery of a large-droplet Flüggian payload from face A to face B. If fomites were a major pathway for COVID-19 infection outside of hospitals, old-age residences, and homes, one would expect restaurant cooks, mass-transit ticket handlers, and FedEx delivery workers to be at the center of major clusters. They’re not. If small-droplet airborne concentrations in unventilated spaces were a common vector for COVID-19 transmission (as with measles, for instance), one would expect whole office buildings to become mass-infection hot spots. That doesn’t seem to have happened. … Fighting this disease will always be hard. But it will be harder still if we fail to develop a proper understanding of the precise way it attacks us.  An important unresolved question is if there is a selection bias in these list of superspreader events. For example, imagine that NYC subways were an important avenue of infection. But imagine how much harder a problem the subway poses for contract tracers than, say, a wedding reception with an official invite list.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency's refusal prompted criticism from the union that the agency was jeopardizing public health.  Union leaders this month had asked FEMA how many employees had tested positive, and in which offices, so that workers who might have interacted with those people could decide whether to get tested. On Friday, FEMA turned down that request, saying the union did not need to know, according to a copy of the agency's letter to the union that was reviewed by The New York Times.  In response to inquiries from The Times, the agency Saturday said that seven employees had tested positive for the coronavirus. \"Currently, FEMA has 11 total cases -- seven employees have tested positive and four potential cases are pending,\" Lizzie Litzow, a spokeswoman for FEMA, said in a statement. \"Individuals who need to be aware of their names and locations have been made aware.\"  \"FEMA has taken every precaution recommended by the CDC to protect all employees,\" Litzow added, referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Steve Reaves, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 4060, which represents about 5,000 FEMA employees, said that by not sharing details about the staff infections with the union, the agency was endangering other employees as well as the safety of the people to whom the agency was providing aid. Overall, the agency has about 14,000 employees.  \"If we're out there handing out masks and gloves, and we've got covid, then they're contaminated,\" said Reaves, referring to the disease caused by the coronavirus.  The concern over the health and safety of FEMA employees comes as the agency is already stretched thin by three years of major natural disasters.  As of Saturday, FEMA was responding to 54 major disasters around the country, according to agency documents. Thirteen states and territories have requested disaster assistance from FEMA for the coronavirus since March 23 alone.  Just one-third of FEMA's trained workforce is available to be deployed, agency data shows. The demand on those workers will most likely grow in the coming weeks and months: Federal scientists predicted this month that 23 states would get \"major to moderate flooding\" between now and the end of May. And hurricane season starts June 1.  The coronavirus has made FEMA's job more challenging in other ways. The traditional response to disasters usually entails gathering large numbers of people -- whether disaster victims in emergency shelters or relief managers in field offices -- in close quarters to dispense relief most efficiently.  The virus, however, is forcing the agency to rethink that approach. It has urged staff members to work from home when possible and distance themselves from their colleagues when it isn't. FEMA has also restricted the number of disaster victims who are allowed inside its field offices at once, and has made it easier for states to shelter victims in hotels or other settings where they don't have to be crammed together.  But those steps only go so far.  Reaves said he was aware of at least three people who worked with the agency and had tested positive. One is in Nashville, where the individual was helping people affected by a tornado. Another is in Atlanta, where FEMA has a regional office. Both people are self-isolating, he said.  The third person worked in FEMA's Washington headquarters and tested positive Tuesday. The official had been working at the coordination center the day before when Vice President Mike Pence, who leads the administration's federal virus task force, hosted a conference call with governors at the center.  The agency said the people leading the coronavirus task force were safe. \"At no time did this individual or any others known to have contact with them come within 6 feet of the vice president or any other task force principal for any period of time,\" Litzow said by email.

Coronavirus has killed nearly 45,000 people worldwide in just three months, with more than 6,000 of those deaths happening in the UK.  Medics and scientists globally are desperately working round-the-clock to find a cure and vaccines for the deadly disease, with trials taking place in China, Russia and the United States.  Covid-19 originated in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, a country famous for alternative natural medicines and treatment.  One of those being colloidal silver, a solution consisting of tiny silver particles in a liquid form.  There is no scientific proof that colloidal silver can cure coronavirus, or other infections, but since the spread of the highly contagious virus, brands producing the product have seen huge increase in traffic to their websites from the European and Asian markets.   (Image: Getty Images)  In the past, the product has been used as a dietary supplement and for therapeutic purposes by doctors.  But Dr Sherrill Sellman went one step further and claimed the silver solution product sold on his website \"could kill coronavirus.\"  Dr Sellman made the comments last month on televangelist Jim Bakker's show in the US further claiming the solution \"deactivates\" the virus.  He said: \"Well, let's say it hasn't been tested on this strain of the coronavirus, but it has been tested on other strains of the coronavirus and has been able to eliminate it within 12 hours.  \"Totally eliminate it. Kills it. Deactivates it.\"   (Image: REUTERS)  As Dr Sellman spoke with Bakker about the product, a message appeared on the bottom of the screen advertising the sale of bottles of the silver solution for $80 (£50).  On March 9, the Food and Drug Administration in the United States issued a warning to seven companies, including the Jim Bakker show, ordering them to stop propelling products that claimed to kill coronavirus.  In the letter, FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D said \"there is already a high level of anxiety over the potential spread of coronavirus,\" and what the country doesn't need \"in this situation are companies preying on consumers by promoting products with fraudulent prevention and treatment claims.\"  He added: \"These warning letters are just the first step. We’re prepared to take enforcement actions against companies that continue to market this type of scam.\"   (Image: Getty Images)  The products cited in these warning letters cover teas, essential oils, tinctures and colloidal silver.  The FDA warned colloidal silver is not safe or effective for treating any disease or condition and said ingesting large amounts of it can cause harm.  Some side affects include argyria, a discolouration of the skin, caused by a build up of tissue causing a bluish-grey discolouration.  Consumers have since been warned to be \"cautious of websites\" and stores selling colloidal silver, and any of those that claim to \"prevent, mitigate, treat, diagnose or cure COVID-19.\"  Daily Star Online has approached the Jim Bakker show for comment.

Items such as hand sanitizer and face masks are hard to come by as people are stockpiling them out of fear of getting sick from the virus.  So, what do you do if you can’t find those convenient products in your favorite store? Fortunately, you may already have cleaning products that can help combat this virus right in your home. In a recent article, Consumer Reports highlighted a number of common household products anyone can use to help destroy this coronavirus virus.  Despite all the fear about the virus, this coronavirus strain (like other coronaviruses) is actually easy to kill out in the open, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.  “Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses, meaning they are one of the easiest types of viruses to kill with the appropriate disinfectant product,” said the EPA on its webpage for disinfecting for this coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.  Certain cleaning products can break that protective envelope surrounding the virus and shut it down, reducing your chances of catching the respiratory illness from your environment. Many people are surprised at the potential effectiveness of simple household products against the coronavirus, though it should be noted that transmission from contaminated surfaces has not yet been documented with the coronavirus.  Consumer Reports recommended four specific products to use to fight against this coronavirus strain:   Soap and Water  Plain old soap and water truly is one of the most effective combos against this virus. Simply using soap and water with friction will break through the virus’s outer protective envelope to kill it.  Palli Thordarson, a professor of chemistry at the University of South Wales, explains why soap is so effective, including some handy diagrams to show soap’s powerful effect on breaking down the coronavirus’ defense.  1/25 Part 1 – Why does soap work so well on the SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus and indeed most viruses?

The Centers for Disease Control recommends preparing a bleach solution by mixing 5 tablespoons (1/3 cup) bleach per gallon of water or 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water.  Make sure the bleach is not past its expiration date, and that you mix the solution in a well-ventilated area. Also, never mix bleach with ammonia or other household chemicals, as the combination can result in toxic fumes. Wear disposable gloves.   Alcohol  In this case, we are not talking about the kind of alcohol you drink. Dr. Siouxsie Wiles, associate professor in charge of the Bioluminescent Superbugs Lab at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, said that ethanol and isopropyl alcohol are both effective at fighting the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.  Many people already have isopropyl alcohol at home (rubbing alcohol). You do not need to dilute this solution. Simply use it straight out of the bottle as a cleanser, but be careful with plastics. Also, it is flammable, so be cautious when using it as an overall cleaner.   Hydrogen Peroxide  We all know hydrogen peroxide does a fantastic job cleaning out minor cuts and scrapes. However, its cleansing ability also works against this coronavirus strain. The Environmental Protection Agency includes a variety of commercial cleaners containing hydrogen peroxide on its official list of effective chemicals against COVID-19. If you cannot find these specific cleaners in your local store, then Consumer Reports suggested putting undiluted 3% hydrogen peroxide in a spray bottle and then spraying the surfaces you want to clean. Allow the solution to sit on the surface for a few minutes to allow it to fight against the virus’s outer protective layer before wiping it up.

The virus has so far claimed around 9000 deaths worldwide while more than 220000 have been tested positive. The pandemic has caused a collapse of sports events in an year when several multi-national events are scheduled to take place.  Sportspersons have also reportedly tested positive for the virus, putting their seasons in jeopardy. Self-quarantine methods are being followed by the athletes to keep themselves safe but that hasn’t kept some of them from being infected.

Later, the Englishman issued a statement saying he had developed fever.   Football  Euro 2020 being postponed is still the biggest casualty due to Coronavirus and that is because the Beautiful Game has been hit the hardest so far. Top football managers, players and even club owners have tested positive, leaving rest of the season in jeopardy.

Follow him on Twitter @GeorgeSzamuely  is a senior research fellow at Global Policy Institute (London) and author of Bombs for Peace: NATO's Humanitarian War on Yugoslavia. Follow him on Twitter @GeorgeSzamuely  NATO, struggling to justify its existence, has found a new role for itself — as an indefatigable fighter against the Covid-19 pandemic. But so far, it has contributed significantly less to this fight than its supposed rivals.  During a NATO foreign ministers meeting, held earlier this month by secure video conference, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg declared, “NATO was created to deal with crises. So we can help and our Alliance is playing its part.” NATO was on the case. But what exactly was it doing? Here Stoltenberg became vague: NATO would apparently offer “logistical, transport and medical help” to member-states fighting the pandemic.  Russia and China have of course been providing “logistical, transport and medical help” all over the world for weeks, but NATO makes it sound as if it alone is doing anything, and rushes to take credit for aid that in reality has nothing to do with the alliance.  On March 30, a cargo aircraft from China landed in the Czech Republic to deliver respirators and face masks. “This was the third such transport flight from China to the Czech Republic…under the NATO supported Strategic Airlift International Solution,” NATO proudly announced. So, China delivers medical equipment, and NATO takes the credit?  Also on rt.com Russian aid to Italy, dubbed an ‘influence operation’ by EU-partnered media outfit, is indeed shameful — for Europe  Recently, NATO member-state Turkey was supposed to deliver medical supplies to NATO member-states Spain and Italy. Once again NATO rushed to take credit. Stoltenberg was “proud to see NATO Allies supporting each other through our disaster relief centre.” Understandably, Stoltenberg didn’t address Spain’s complaint that Turkey had seized hundreds of ventilators and sanitary equipment that Spain had already paid for. The ventilators had reportedly been manufactured in Turkey on behalf of a Spanish firm that bought the components from China. Subsequently, Turkey ordered all domestic mask producers to produce exclusively for the Turkish state.  Lack of cooperation among NATO member-states has become endemic. In the US, the Trump administration ordered healthcare equipment firm 3M to stop exporting N95 respirator masks to Canada and Latin America. In response, Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister threatened retaliation: “We have an enormous number of products that are essential for the United States in their fight against Covid-19.” Canada, he said, provides the US doctors, nurses, testing kits and key ingredients for the N95 masks.  Meanwhile, Germany accused the US of engaging in “modern piracy” by diverting in Bangkok, Thailand, 200,000 facemasks that were destined for Germany. France also complained when the US seized a consignment of masks bound for France from China. “The masks were on a plane at Shanghai airport…when the U.S. buyers turned up and offered three times what their French counterparts were paying,” the Guardian reported.  Germany, in turn, had initially banned the export of medical masks and other protective gear to Italy. Though Germany did eventually relent, there was no relenting on Spain, Italy and France’s plea that coronavirus-incurred debt be shared out in the form of corona-bonds. Germany’s refusal infuriated the Italians so much, that a group of Italian mayors and politicians bought a page in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung to remind Germany that it had not been forced to pay back its debts after World War II.  In stark contrast to the reluctance of NATO member-states to do much for one another, China and Russia have been delivering aid all over the world, including NATO countries. Russia sent masks and ventilators to the United States; and ventilators, medical equipment and military virologists and epidemiologists to Italy. Russia also sent coronavirus testing kits to Iran, North Korea and Venezuela, as well as to former USSR republics such as Armenia, Azerbaijan and Belarus. Russia has also sent military doctors and virology and epidemiology specialists to Serbia.  China also stepped up to the plate. It sent coronavirus testing kits as well as ventilators, masks and doctors to Italy; testing kits to Spain; and facemasks to Holland. It also delivered coronavirus testing kits to Palestine, and aid to Cambodia and Malaysia.  Also on rt.com ‘America First’: Covid-19 exposes cracks in Trans-Atlantic solidarity as US snatches up France-bound masks  NATO as useless now as in 2008 & 2015 crises  Contrary to Stoltenberg’s claims then, the most striking feature of the coronavirus crisis is the absence of a NATO contribution to its solution. Pandemics are as old as humanity. Sooner or later, something like Covid-19 was bound to come along. Yet, despite all of the resources NATO had eaten up over the years, it has undertaken no emergency planning for a possible pandemic or a biological weapon attack. Its military hardware, vaunted command structures and constant military exercises are as useless today as they were in 2015 when Europe faced its last serious crisis.  Of course, it was NATO itself that triggered the 2015 migration crisis. Its reckless intervention to overthrow the government of Libya’s Muammar al-Qaddafi threw the previously stable North African country into chaos and caused the massive flow of migrants into Europe. The same sequence followed the subsequent intervention of key NATO powers in the civil war in Syria.  In 2015, Europeans woke up to discover not only that their most urgent security problem was not Russia, Ukraine and Crimea (NATO’s obsessive concern), but Europe’s open borders, a problem NATO had done nothing to address and, worse, had exacerbated by fueling instability on Europe’s periphery. Yet NATO offered no explanation as to why Europe’s borders had remained so porous for decades. Similarly, in the face of a spate of terrorist attacks in Europe in 2015, NATO was unable to explain why, after supposedly fighting terrorism for the better part of two decades, it had done so little to safeguard Europe from the scourge of terrorism.   Read more  In a speech delivered in Wellington, New Zealand, on Aug. 5, 2019, a few months before the Covid-19 outbreak, Stoltenberg declared that the greatest challenge the West faced was “increased competition between great powers” and that “a more assertive Russia, is putting the rules based order under pressure.” Russia was everywhere, threatening everyone, “trying to meddle in and undermining the trust in democratic institutions.” And then there was “the rise of China.” China and Russia, Stoltenberg warned, “represent challenges for all of us, both NATO Allies and…many other countries.”  So there it is. A few months before the onset of a global pandemic, the full ramifications of which we can today barely grasp, NATO was expressing alarm about Russia and China, the two powers that have done far more to help NATO countries out during this pandemic than NATO itself has.  Meanwhile, Europe and the United States careen toward an economic catastrophe that will dwarf the 2008 crisis by several orders of magnitude. NATO’s contribution to solving that crisis will be as useless as its contribution to solving the 2008 crisis. What will it be? It will plead with member-states not to skimp on their contributions to a security organization from which they derive no security.  Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!

The Andheri-based couple spent 14 days in Kasturba Hospital and have recovered completely.  The 70-year-old man and with his 69-year-old wife were diagnosed with Covid-19 on March 11. They were among those tested following contact tracing of the first patient from Pune. The couple told their son and daughter, both of whom live abroad, that they’d tested positive, but did not disclose this information to other family members.  When the couple was admitted, there were 20 beds in the ward, but more were added in the 14 days that the husband and wife spent in Kasturba Hospital.  The 70-year-old, who has a history of diabetes and hypertension, said he hadn’t felt afraid until the 11th day, when his condition deteriorated. “My wife had recovered earlier than me so she was shifted outside. I thought I would recover soon. But suddenly, I started vomiting. I thought I wouldn’t survive,” he said, adding that hospital staffers looked out for him when he was feeling low.  The most unsettling day was when a Covid-positive patient passed away. “There was sudden noise in the ward,” he recalled. “I inquired with a nurse. She told me that a 65-year-old man had succumbed to the infection in the isolation cabin next to mine. A cold chill ran down my spine,” he said.  The couple was discharged on March 24, after testing negative for the virus. Back home in Andheri, they isolated themselves for another 14 days. “The domestic help didn’t come and we were too weak to cook. So our neighbours provided all the help,” he said.  More than a month after their recovery, the couple are yet to tell their extended family of their illness. “I come from a village where people don’t understand this disease is curable so I haven’t told them we were infected with Covid-19. Our family members will be stigmatised,” said the man, who is the first of his family to settle in Mumbai.

The Duke of Edinburgh, 98, said he wanted to recognise the 'vital and urgent' medical and scientific work taking place to battle the deadly virus.  It is a rare public statement from the Royal - who has not been seen since he was hospitalised in December - as he approaches his 99th birthday in June.  His warm remarks were in stark contract to the media blaze created by his grandson Prince Harry and Meghan Markle who last night said they will 'no longer engage' with the nation's most popular newspaper titles.  Royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams said the country will have been inspired by Philip's words, but Harry's decision was 'strange'.  Piers Morgan added the country was 'so well rid of the ghastly Sussexes & so lucky to have our senior royals'.  The LA-based couple were blasted by other commentators for their timing of the letter to four newspaper groups detailing how their self-imposed ban is a refusal to 'offer themselves up'.  The Society of Editors branded the move censorship, adding it was 'a clear attempt to undermine certain sections of the UK media'.  The Queen's former press spokesmen Dickie Arbiter claimed the couple was 'wrong' and that Harry 'was not the brightest bunny on the planet'.  Prince Charles's biographer Tom Bower said the Sussexes 'have become their own worst enemies' and was baffled they can only think of themselves 'in the midst of a horrendous global crisis'.  Prince Philip, 98, has thanked medics, scientists and researchers who are tackling the ongoing coronavirus pandemic  The Duke of Edinburgh said: 'On behalf of those of us who remain safe and at home, I also wanted to thank all key workers who ensure the infrastructure of our life continues; the staff and volunteers working in food production and distribution, those keeping postal and delivery services going, and those ensuring the rubbish continues to be collected'  It came after the Duke's grandson Prince Harry and wife Meghan Markle (pictured in LA last week) said they will 'no longer engage' with the nation's most popular newspaper titles  Philip, who retired from public duties in 2017, thanked key workers involved in food production and distribution, rubbish collection and the post services.  In his tribute, published on the royal family's social media channels, he said: 'As we approach World Immunisation Week, I wanted to recognise the vital and urgent work being done by so many to tackle the pandemic; by those in the medical and scientific professions, at universities and research institutions, all united in working to protect us from Covid-19.  'On behalf of those of us who remain safe and at home, I also wanted to thank all key workers who ensure the infrastructure of our life continues; the staff and volunteers working in food production and distribution, those keeping postal and delivery services going, and those ensuring the rubbish continues to be collected.'  The duke, who is staying with the Queen at Windsor Castle with a reduced household for their safety, is affiliated to more than 750 organisations.  These include the scientific, technological research, healthcare and infrastructure sectors, which have been responding to the outbreak.  Philip, in his tribute published on the royal family's social media channels, said: 'As we approach World Immunisation Week, I wanted to recognise the vital and urgent work being done by so many to tackle the pandemic'  The Duke's rare message came the morning after Prince Harry and Meghan's bombshell letter to some of the British press.  The note was sent from an official Sussex Royal email, despite the Queen banning them from using the title and them saying they plan to use Archewell.  They emailed the editors of the nations most popular publications: the Daily Mail, the Daily Mirror, the Sun and the Daily Express.  Prince Harry had earlier on Sunday caused outrage by suggesting the coronavirus crisis sweeping Britain was 'better than we are led to believe through certain corners of the media'.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have said they will no longer respond to enquiries from journalists at some British papers. Pictured with son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor during a royal tour of South Africa, September 25, 2019  Their letter was widely criticised by royal and media commentators, especially in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, while Philip's words were met with praise.  Fitzwilliams told MailOnline: 'The country will have been inspired by the Duke of Edinburgh’s message to those fighting coronavirus in the front line and to other key workers.  'Harry’s ill-judged comment that the situation regarding the deadly pathogen in Britain is ''better than we are led to believe through certain corners of the media'' is strange and not only because of its timing, as the Sussexes cut all links with the British tabloids.'  The Society of Editors brands the Sussex's letter censorship Executive Director Ian Murray said: 'Although the Duke and Duchess say they support a free press and all it stands for there is no escaping their actions here amount to censorship and they are setting an unfortunate example. 'Although the couple may no longer style themselves as working royals, they continue to be high-profile public figures and indeed have made plain their intention to continue to do so. By appearing to dictate which media they will work with and which they will ignore they, no doubt unintentionally, give succour to the rich and powerful everywhere to use their example as an excuse to attack the media when it suits them. 'The truth is that Harry and Meghan have enjoyed and continue to enjoy a huge amount of positive coverage for themselves and their causes, much of it carried in the very titles they are now targeting. They may have been stung by some of the coverage they have not liked, they may disagree strongly with some elements of that coverage and can of course take action to answer any criticism they consider unfair or inaccurate through several channels. But the answer should never be to attempt to shun individual titles and their millions of readers.' Advertisement  Executive director of the Society of Editors Ian Murray said the statement was 'sadly a clear attempt to undermine certain sections of the UK media who often ask uncomfortable questions'.  Mr Arbiter said: 'I really want to know who is advising them because they are wrong... unless they are doing it themselves.  'Not only this, Harry was wrong over the weekend. because 2.4million deaths is bad, 16,000 in the UK is bad.  'So how he can even suggest it isn't as bad as what is being said about it is wrong. But then again, he is not the brightest bunny on the planet.'  Mr Bower added: 'The Sussexes have become their own worst enemies. They clearly cannot stand being irrelevant and ignored.  'In the midst of a horrendous global crisis causing so much misery all they can think about is themselves.  'Constantly they push their obsession about their image and their financial income into the spotlight, and then outrageously harangue the public with their problems. Meghan, just understand: No one cares!'  The Sussexes completed their last royal duty on March 31, before stepping away from the monarchy - dropping their HRH styles - for a life mostly in LA.  President Donald Trump said the US will not pay for the couple's estimated £4million security costs, which had been picked up by the Metropolitan Police.  Earlier this month the Mail revealed Harry and Meghan had agreed to pay for the cost of their security, which will reportedly consist of former SAS soldiers at a cost of £400 per operative per day.  Harry, 35, and 38-year-old Meghan's letter was sent to the editors of the news groups involved last night.  They wrote: 'Please note that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not be engaging with your outlet. There will be no corroboration and zero engagement.'  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's letter to four UK news companies Sent to editors of British newspapers including The Daily Mail, Mirror, The Sun or Express: 'As the Duke and Duchess of Sussex now settle into the next chapter of their lives and no longer receive any publicly funded support, we are writing to set a new media relations policy, specifically as it pertains to your organisation. Like you, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex believe that a free press is a cornerstone to any democracy - particularly in moments of crisis. At its best, this free press shines light on dark places, telling stories that would otherwise go untold, standing up for what's right, challenging power, and holding those who abuse the system to account. It has been said that journalism's first obligation is to the truth. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex agree wholeheartedly. It is gravely concerning that an influential slice of the media, over many years, has sought to insulate themselves from taking accountability for what they say or print - even when they know it to be distorted, false, or invasive beyond reason. When power is enjoyed without responsibility, the trust we all place in this much needed industry is degraded. There is a real human cost to this way of doing business and it affects every corner of society. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have watched people they know - as well as complete strangers - have their lives completely pulled apart for no good reason, other than the fact that salacious gossip boosts advertising revenue. With that said, please note that The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not be engaging with your outlet. There will be no corroboration and zero engagement. This is also a policy being instated for their communications team, in order to protect that team from the side of the industry that readers never see. This policy is not about avoiding criticism. It's not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting. Media have every right to report on The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad. But it can't be based on a lie. They also want to be very clear: this is not in any way a blanket policy for all media. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are looking forward to working with journalists and media organisations all over the world, engaging with grassroots media, regional and local media, and young, and up-and-coming journalists, to spotlight issues and causes that so desperately need acknowledging. And they look forward to doing whatever they can to help further opportunities for more diverse and underrepresented voices, who are needed now more than ever. What they won't do is offer themselves up as currency for an economy of clickbait and distortion. We are encouraged that this new approach will be heard and respected.'

It's not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting.  'Media have every right to report on The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad. But it can't be based on a lie.

The strongly worded piece suggests the papers involved have been responsible for publishing 'salacious gossip' which they know to be 'distorted, false, or invasive beyond reason'.  But they faced a furious backlash, with Mr Morgan saying: 'As Meghan & Harry berate the media, claim #coronavirus crisis is exaggerated & leak texts to her father......Prince Philip sends a simple heartfelt message of support to those on the frontline.  'Britain is so well rid of the ghastly Sussexes & so lucky to have our senior royals.'  The BBC's Mr Neil added: 'As the world grapples with Covid-19, do they really think people care what media they deal with?  'Their solipsism is amazing. Can't they just consign themselves to oblivion for a while? Or at least hire someone who can write a press release in clear, decent English.'  Piers Morgan and Andrew Neil were among a host of commentators today to criticise the move  The couple say they accept the media has 'every right' to report on the high-profile ex-royals.  But they claim in the letters: 'This policy is not about avoiding criticism. It's not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting.

'At its best, this free press shines light on dark places, telling stories that would otherwise go untold, standing up for what's right, challenging power, and holding those who abuse the system to account.  'It has been said that journalism's first obligation is to the truth. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex agree wholeheartedly.'  Prince Harry and Meghan started married life at Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate and have agreed to pay back the £2.4million of taxpayer money spent on its refurbishment.  Harry and Meghan had lived in Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate (pictured) and have agreed to pay back the £2.4million of taxpayer money spent on its refurbishment  They moved to Vancouver Island in Canada late last year, where they spent Christmas with their son Archie.  The Sussexes are currently believed to be living in rented accommodation in LA near their friend Sir Elton John.  Prince Charles will continue to pay for the upkeep of his son and daughter-in-law for the first 12 months of their new life in the US.  This will come from his private funds, not the Duchy of Cornwall, but it is understood it will not be used for their protection.  In the letter the pair praise the work of the media as a 'cornerstone to any democracy' that 'shines light on dark places, telling stories that would otherwise go untold, standing up for what's right, challenging power, and holding those who abuse the system to account'.  The ex-Royals are pictured on March 9 as they arrive to attend the annual Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey in London  But they said they have found the actions of an 'influential slice of the media' gravely concerning, adding they believe there is a 'human cost'.  Both Prince Harry and Meghan said they have 'watched people they know have their lives completely pulled apart for no good reason' by the media.  The ex-royals state: 'Please note that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not be engaging with your outlet.  'There will be no corroboration and zero engagement. This is also a policy being instated for their communications team, in order to protect that team from the side of the industry that readers never see.'  Representatives for the Sussex's added the 'zero engagement policy' would extend to both the Sunday paper and online editions of each newspaper.  In a final statement the letter concludes: 'We are encouraged that this new approach will be heard and respected.'  Communications for the couple will now be handled by Sunshine Sachs, a New York based PR firm, with only one UK-based representative.  The hard-nosed Manhattan PR company is known for specialising in 'crisis communications' for celebrities.  It has previously worked for Hollywood royalty including Leonardo DiCaprio, Natalie Portman, Bette Midler, Barbra Streisand, Jennifer Lopez and Michael Jackson's family.  It is not yet known which media outlets will continue to have contact with the Sussexes.  But the letter details how the pair 'look forward' to engaging with 'grassroots, regional and local press' to further causes that 'desperately need acknowledging'.

The US President said he “hasn’t heard about testing in weeks” during a conference call with governors, but they seemed to have a different view. Democrat Gov Steve Bullock of Montana explained that experts in his state were in favour of doing “contact tracing” - finding people who have come into contact with others who had tested positive for coronavirus.  He argued that it was a difficult task because they do not have the adequate test, according to an audio file obtained by The New York Times. President Trump suggested the Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, could respond to the testing question, but quickly added his own rebuttal. He said: “We’ve tested more now than any nation in the world. “We’ve got these great tests and we’re coming out with a faster one this week.” Please sign up to pledge your support now to our brave NHS Heroes  Trump ignores 'desperate' pleas for more testing kits in US  “I haven’t heard about testing being a problem.” Despite Mr Trump’s claims many are still struggling to get tested, even when presenting symptoms. Gov Jay Inslee of Washington State told CNN Sunday that “we have a desperate need for the testing kits.” Gov Ralph Northam of Virginia said last week that there was a lack of testing supplies in his state.

Admiral Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health leading the testing response nationally, said that a testing kit that provides results within minutes will be available soon across 50 states.

But one thing seems beyond dispute: The federal government is making an all-out effort to help.  Further, the innumerable press briefings and public statements leave no question as to the administration’s overall game plan and what the White House sees as the likely endgame.  To make sure we’re all on the same page, let’s review the game plan.  The first step was to slow the arrival of COVID-19 to our shores. The president did that by restricting travel from overseas—starting with China, then extending that to other nations as the disease spread.  In retrospect, the wisdom of that move is obvious. Places that restricted travel from China early on—Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea—have the best record of slowing the rate of infection. Countries such as Italy and Iran that were late in turning off the tap from China suffered a viral tsunami and spread the problem to their neighbors.  Next, Washington started sending support to state and local governments and easing restrictions on both public and private sector operations so that they can contribute more—and more quickly—to the response effort.  We are seeing that pay off already, as Medicare patients can now take advantage of telemedicine, more manufacturers are allowed to produce protective gear, and clinical trials of promising treatments are getting fast-tracked. These actions are geared to slowing the spread of COVID-19, protecting vulnerable populations, and assuring treatment is available to patients.  Right now, from a public health perspective, the No. 1 goal is to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed. The most effective preventative tool for this is social distancing, which is why officials at all levels of government are so insistent on the practice. But Washington is also striving to make sure state and local governments have the assets necessary to provide the level of care needed.  Most recently, the administration has turned to address the non-health-related consequences of both the disease and the response. It is focusing now on delivering aid to the individuals and small businesses that will bear the brunt of the economic and social costs of social distancing. A bill meant to accomplish that is expected to pass this week.  The single most crucial step right now is to bend the curve as fast and expeditiously as possible. Limiting the spread of the disease will make dealing with outbreaks more manageable and buy time to deliver the prophylactics, testing, and therapeutics that will enable the health system to deal with a persistent presence of COVID-19. Yes, we hope COVID-19 will, like the flu, wane with warmer weather, but, right now we just don’t know.  Keeping the disease at manageable levels will allow Americans to get back to business. In the meanwhile, the U.S. will have to continue to manage international travel so we don’t reimport the virus. After all, you can’t drain the bathtub if you have the faucet running full tilt.  Of course, everyone anticipates the development of a vaccine to help manage COVID-19, but no one knows how far off that may be. And we can’t wait indefinitely for a cure-all.  We can, however, keep taking intelligent steps to get COVID-19 under control. And once we do that, we will need to get the economy up and running as soon as possible.  And that will be just as great a challenge as the public health challenge. In economics as in health, the governing principle should be “First, do no harm.” That said, how Washington decides to help matters a very great deal.  My colleagues at The Heritage Foundation have great reservations about the recovery bill lawmakers worked on over the weekend and they have outlined what seems to be a much better approach.  Let’s hope Washington acts wisely on this. It’s a big decision: one that will determine whether this nation emerges from the COVID-19 crisis more—or much less—free, prosperous, and safe than when the crisis began.

HALIFAX, Nova Scotia — The Archbishop of Halifax-Yarmouth in Canada has offered prayers for the victims of a weekend shooting rampage in a small town in Nova Scotia, including a member of the country’s Royal Canadian Mounted Police.  In a letter addressed to the commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) dated April 20, Archbishop Anthony Mancini of Halifax-Yarmouth expressed condolences for the death of Constable Heidi Stevenson, a 23-year veteran of the force.  “I wish to express on my behalf, as Archbishop of Halifax-Yarmouth, and in the name of Catholic faithful, our sincere condolences on the loss of life of Constable Heidi Stevenson,” said Archbishop Mancini.  “Her death in the line of duty indicates the highest sacrifice that one can make on behalf of the citizens she served,” he added. The archbishop said that he would be praying for her family, and for the officers of the RCMP who are mourning her life.  In a video message posted on Tuesday, April 21, Archbishop Mancini offered condolences, prayers, and assurances to the people of his archdiocese after, according to police, denture-fitter Gabriel Wortman went on a 14-hour shooting attack which spread across Saturday and Sunday.  “These last few days have been a shock, as we have all been affected by the useless and premature death of so many of our fellow citizens,” he said. “Try as we will to understand this tragedy, it remains incomprehensible. We are experiencing a great sense of loss, frustration, and even anger,” he added.  As of Monday morning, 18 people have been confirmed to have been killed by the shooter, making it the deadliest mass shooting in Canadian history, stunning a province which typically sees fewer than 15 homicides total per year.  Authorities have not yet determined a motive for why the 51-year-old denture fitter committed the attack. The suspect is now deceased, although it has not yet been determined how he died.  Archbishop Mancini acknowledged that the existing circumstances related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has made the grieving process more complicated.  “This loss of life comes upon us at a time when we are already weighed down by the threat of the coronavirus. In this time of mourning, we ought to be able to come together to experience the comfort of community care and its support. Yet here we are, in isolation in order to stay safe, making the present circumstances even more tragic,” he said.  The archbishop encouraged people to use “technological means” to offer support to each other throughout the grieving process, and reminded Nova Scotians that “love is greater than tragedy and death.”  “I wish to extend to all the families and friends of those who have died our prayers and our expression of solidarity,” he said. “In this time, when we celebrate the resurrection, it is good to recall that death is not the last word.”  Archbishop Mancini also suggested that his flock pray for “the growing number of COVID-19 victims” and “for those on the front lines doing all they can to protect us--the doctors, the nurses, and of course, the police.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 9, "positive": 16, "negative": 4, "disgust": 1, "anger": 13, "surprise": 1, "fear": 5, "trust": 3}, "metadata": ["province", "canada", "victims", "experiencing", "acknowledged", "ongoing", "pandemic", "isolation", "families"]}, {"text": "Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.

Some of them might be happy, but they never stop working or drinking long enough to find out.  Don’t let the shallowness fool you—the swamp creatures are some of the most privileged people in our society, and their time in quarantine has only underscored just how good they have it. They wake up just before noon, fix themselves a Nespresso, telework for a few hours on the couch, order food delivery, and watch a Netflix show about crazy tiger people in Oklahoma. Rinse—unless they’re skipping showers—and repeat.  The new book by conservative New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, The Decadent Society, warns that our society has become so successful that we’ve been lulled into a sad state of complacency, seeking small and tasteless comforts to ease our anxiety about the future. If that’s true, then call this the decadent quarantine. No one knows just how many deaths we’ll be left with after the global pandemic caused by COVID-19 hits its peak spread or how society will function in the aftermath, so we coddle ourselves with mini vacations in our homes, refusing to change out of pajamas long enough to feel like a real human.  Americans are doubling down on decadent behavior to deal with the fear and stress associated with battling an “invisible enemy,” as the president calls it, but it’s taking a toll on our physical and mental health. According to Axios, fitness tracking apps have found people are moving less, alcohol sales are up, porn consumption is up 6.4%, and weed sales are “soaring.”  The coronavirus could have been the event that shakes us out of our fat slumber, and it still might be. But instead, too many of us have retreated even further into our cocoons, soothed by the convenience of city life and technology. The concept of food insecurity doesn’t hit when you can have the steak frites from Medium Rare dropped off at your front door without ever coming into contact with a delivery driver. PornHub is offering free premium memberships for those who would like to self-pleasure their way through house arrest. Consumerism is alive and well, with many stores offering massive online sales and extended return dates because they’re desperate to stay in business. Some of us crave our nights out at the bar with friends, but don’t worry—that can be remedied with a wine club mailer and calling up 20 acquaintances on Zoom.  Some of these quarantine activities may sound like good fun, but quickly become quite sad when stacked together to fill weeks of time. In one hilarious but depressing video, an Amazon worker begged white women to stop ordering dildos from the service because, contrary to the belief of lonely single women, they are not actually considered essential items.  Even those of us who seek self-improvement during quarantine have the tendency to overshare our progress for social media clout. Sometimes posting the photos of our fresh baked bread or our newfound knitting skills fulfills a strange technological need to prove that we’re working harder than everyone else rather than doing these things solely because they’re valuable to the self.  Don’t expect things to change when the pandemic finally passes through. Despite spending weeks wrapped up in a security blanket, the DC elite who never had to worry about a missed paycheck will somehow make themselves the prime victims of the quarantine. Any relationships they managed to build in their communities or their families will dissipate after the first bottomless brunch, leading them right back to the disconnected and overly individualistic society they’ve created.

(AP) - The health secretary of Pennsylvania says people shouldn’t be expecting a quick return to their regular way of life even after pandemic restrictions begin to ease in some counties next month.  Dr. Rachel Levine, asked how crowds and social distancing might mix in the months ahead in places such as restaurants, playgrounds and carnivals, forecast no quick end to “the new normal.”  “I think that the idea — and the governor has spoken on this — that we’re going to go back exactly to how we were before, at least for the foreseeable future, is unlikely,” Levine said. “I think there will be a new normal. But as the governor often says, Pennsylvanians are strong and resilient and we will get through this.”  Asked earlier whether social distancing measures would continue during the summer, Levine said it was too soon to tell, citing the progressive easing of business closure and stay-at-home orders to begin May 8 in some counties.  “It’s too early to decide what things will look like in the middle of the summer,” Levine said.  State health officials on Saturday announced that a total of 1,537 deaths associated with the coronavirus have occurred in Pennsylvania. The department confirmed an additional 1,397 positive cases of COVID-19, bringing the statewide total to more than 40,000. The number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.  For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up in a couple of weeks. Older adults and people with existing health problems are at higher risk of more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.  Levine said it was clear that “there are many more people in Pennsylvania and in any state that have had COVID-19 than we exactly know of at this time, and that does influence the death rate.”  Although some areas have reported death rates closer to 1 in 100 rather than the much higher rates feared earlier, Levine noted that that range is “still 10 times the death rate that it is for influenza.”  Levine said “a significant amount” of those who have died had preexisting conditions such as heart disease, hypertension, high blood pressure, and lung disease - particularly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease including emphysema and chronic bronchitis — as well as diabetes and kidney disease.  “The majority of deaths have been in seniors, the majority of deaths have been in patients in nursing homes,” Levine said. “Many of those patients have co-morbid conditions, sometimes clusters of co-morbid conditions, and that puts them at particular risk from contracting COVID-19 and from getting very ill and tragically passing away from COVID-19.”   FOOD SUPPLY WORKERS-TESTS:  Workers supporting the food supply chain in some areas of eastern Pennsylvania will be eligible for priority COVID-19 testing at two sites, state officials said Saturday.  The policy applies to workers ranging from farmers and seasonal laborers to food processing facility and warehouse workers, as well as grocery store employees who live or work in Montgomery, Susquehanna, Wyoming, Luzerne, Carbon, Monroe, Pike, Wayne, and Lackawanna counties, the state agriculture department said.  Adults with symptoms who work in agriculture or food supply and live or work in the affected counties will be able to get priority testing at the Montgomery County mass testing site or the federally funded site at the Mohegan Sun in Luzerne County.  The testing comes at no cost as tests are run through Pennsylvania’s public laboratory system.  Officials cited the designation of agriculture and the entire food supply chain as life sustaining, combined with coronavirus hot spots in Montgomery County and northeastern Pennsylvania, where many of Pennsylvania’s food processing facilities are located.   ___  Sign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters  Copyright © 2020 The Washington Times, LLC.

The Director of Public Affairs of the National Assembly Dr. Yahaya Danzaria told DAILY POST on Saturday that the upper and lower legislative Chamber was shut down on March 24th, 2020 as precautionary measures against the spread of the virus.  Dr. Danzaria stressed that the entire complex has already been fumigated and decontaminated against the virus in order to protect anyone that may have access to the complex and its offices.  “As part of the NASS management efforts to ensure that all staff of the Assembly works in a safe and secure environment, the entire complex has already been fumigated and decontaminated against the coronavirus or any other virus that may pose any danger to staff, parliamentarians and visitors to the complex.”  Speaking on the welfare of staff in light of pressure on finances of government institutions, Dr. Danzaria explained that the management had met with expectations in payment of salaries and allowances of workers so far.  According to him, the Senate President, Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila and the Clerk to the National Assembly, Sani Ataba Omolori have made efforts to ensure that the issue of welfare was a priority for stability of the Assembly, adding that payments were made despite the pandemic challenge.  He further explained on areas the leadership has intervened while on break. He said:  “The leadership of the National Assembly, despite the shutdown of both the Assembly Complex and the FCT has been relentless in its various interventions in order to ensure the welfare of not just the staff of the National Assembly, but Nigerians in general.  “The President of the Senate and the Speaker of House of Representatives have held several joint and separate meeting with various stakeholders in the federal government’s lead fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.  “Some of the critical areas the leadership has intervened include the persecution of Nigerians in China, improving of electricity supply to Nigerians while the lockdown lasts,  “The expansion to accommodate more vulnerable Nigerians in the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) component of the Federal Government’s Social Investment Programme (SIP) as well as giving legal framework to various emergency intervention programmes of the federal government.  “The management of the Assembly had continued to prioritise the welfare of the staff as part of the reform efforts to increase productivity of Assembly.  “Staff welfare is top priority for the management. In fact, on April salary, our staff started receiving their salaries since Thursday this week.  “We made all the necessary arrangement with Sun Trust Bank to ensure that our staff were paid their salaries seamlessly even while they are at home,” the director said.

Pakistan has ramped up testing, but the poor country that on Friday received a $1.4 billion International Monetary Fund emergency loan conducts less than 6,500 tests a day.  There are 220 million people in Pakistan, a country with less than 3,000 intensive care beds and a health care system that struggled to deal with its sick before the pandemic strained its resources.  But it is the government’s refusal to rein in its radical religious leaders and order its mosques closed that has its critics worried as the group causing one of the fastest spreads of the virus inside Pakistan was the Tableeghi Jamaat (Islamic missionaries), whose massive gatherings in March were stopped late.  In religiously conservative Pakistan Islamic clerics have become increasingly powerful, using their ability to rally the faithful into mobs in the street.  On Friday in a mosque in the federal capital, scores of faithful gathered for Friday prayers in defiance of a government order to limit gatherings to four or less. Standing guard inside the mosque was a guard with a firearm at his side. The capital police did not prevent the gathering.   —-  SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea has reported 18 new cases of the coronavirus, its lowest daily jump since Feb. 20, continuing a downward trend as officials discuss more sustainable forms of social distancing that allows for some communal and economic activity.  Figures released by South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Saturday brought national totals to 10,653 cases and 232 virus-related deaths. The caseload continued to wane in the hardest-hit city of Daegu, where officials say the number of active cases dropped below 1,000 for the first time since a surge of infections in late February.  At least 993 of overall infections have been linked to arrivals from overseas. Most of these cases were detected in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area over the past month as thousands of students and other South Korean nationals returned home amid worsening outbreaks and suspended school years in Europe and the United States.  Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip on Saturday called for vigilance to maintain the hard-won gains against the virus, raising concern over continuing infections at hospitals and local transmissions health workers have been unable to trace. It would also take a week or two to assess the impact of Wednesday’s national parliamentary election, which showed the highest turnout in nearly three decades despite the epidemic.  While saying that a quick return to pre-COVID-19 normalcy would be impossible, Kim said officials as early as Sunday could announce essential parts of a new guideline that would replace the country’s weeks-long social distancing campaign. Officials have said they are looking for ways to allow people to engage in “certain levels of economic and social activity” while containing the risk of infection.  Government officials have yet to share specific details about the new guideline.   —-  SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea says it released all foreign nationals from coronavirus quarantine while it continues to strengthen anti-virus efforts.  The official Korean Central News Agency also said Saturday authorities released all citizens who had been quarantined in the provinces of South Phyongan and North Hwanghae, which are near capital Pyongyang, and the city of Rason at a tri-point bordering China and Russia.  The report didn’t specify how many people remained under the country’s 30-day quarantine. Figures from previous state media reports suggest the North would have released close to 10,000 people over the past weeks.  The North had initially placed 380 foreigners under quarantine. The North in March arranged a special government flight to fly out dozens of diplomats to Vladivostok, Russia.  The KCNA says officials are continuing to strengthen “medical monitoring” of its citizens while ensuring normal activity for those released from quarantine.  The North has said there hasn’t been a single virus case on its territory, but the claim is questioned by many outside experts.  Describing its anti-virus efforts as a “matter of national existence,” the North has banned foreign tourists, shut down nearly all cross-border traffic with China, intensified screening at entry points and mobilized health workers to monitor residents and isolate those with symptoms.   ___  TOKYO — Japan had 556 new cases of the coronavirus, bringing a national total to 9,795, the country’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare said Saturday.  With an addition of 712 others from a cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo earlier this year, Japan now has 10,507 cases altogether, surpassing the 10,000-mark about three months after the first case was found in the country.  Nearly one-third of the domestic cases come from Tokyo, where daily surge in the cases has overburdened hospitals, triggering fear of the collapse of medical system.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expanded his April 7 state of emergency, which was limited to Tokyo and six other urban prefectures, to all of Japan on Thursday. He expressed concern at a news conference Friday that people are not observing the government-requested social distancing as much as they should.  So far, additional requests of non-essential business closures are in place only in Tokyo and several other prefectures, and starting in few other areas. In Japan, the measures carry no penalties.  Abe’s nationwide stay-at-home request comes ahead of the weekend and an upcoming “golden week” holidays at the end of April, as official try to stop people from travelling and potentially spreading virus. Abe also announced a 100,000-yen ($930) cash handout to all residents to give them more incentive to comply.   —-  BEIJING — China has reported 27 new confirmed cases of COVID-19, as it tries to stem an upsurge in infections in a northeastern province bordering Russia.  Twenty of the new cases were in Heilongjiang province, including 13 Chinese nationals who had returned recently from Russia. The land border with Russia has been closed.  China’s official death toll rose sharply to 4,632, reflecting a major upwards revision the previous day by authorities in Wuhan, the nation’s hardest-hit city.  The latest confirmed cases brought the total to 82,719, of which 77,029 have recovered and been discharged, the National Health Commission said.  Eighteen officials in Heilongjiang province have been punished for failures in their response to the outbreak, state media reported Friday. They include the deputy mayor of Harbin, the provincial capital, and a vice-president of Harbin Medical University. They were given warnings, or demerits, in their personnel files.   —-  WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump says he remains hopeful that he will be able to resume campaign rallies ahead of the November election.  Trump said that he does not want social distancing at his rallies, which typically draw big crowds, because doesn’t want attendees to miss the “flavour” of the experience. Trump stopped holding his big stadium rallies in early March because of the coronavirus pandemic.  The president predicted that when the rallies resume they’ll be “bigger than ever.”  Trump has only left Washington once over the last month as he’s dealt with the pandemic.  But the president announced Friday that he plans to travel to the U.S. Military Academy in New York next month for its commencement ceremony.   ___  Follow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak   The Associated Press  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 18, "joy": 6, "negative": 15, "sadness": 2, "disgust": 4, "positive": 32, "anger": 10, "surprise": 6, "fear": 16, "trust": 8}, "metadata": ["coronavirus", "mild", "symptoms", "virus", "korea", "lowest", "minister", "pakistan", "beds", "pandemic", "strained", "gatherings", "mosque", "distancing", "economic", "totals", "1,000", "surge", "linked", "students", "united", "quarantine", "china", "media", "initially", "dozens", "screening", "ministry", "labor", "cruise", "non-essential", "nationwide", "spreading", "beijing", "province", "chinese", "russia", "toll", "recovered", "mayor", "provincial", "washington", "donald", "trump", "predicted", "ap"]}, {"text": "Coronavirus testing in the United States is moving into a new phase as scientists begin looking into people’s blood for signs they’ve been infected by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. This technique is called serological testing.  Virologist Daniel Stadlbauer helped develop a serological test to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and helped transfer it from the research lab to the clinical setting. Epidemiologist Aubree Gordon regularly uses serological assays in her research studies on influenza and dengue fever. She’s now established serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 in her research lab.  Here, the collaborators explain how the technology works.  What do these tests look for?  Serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 are blood tests. They look at serum or plasma – basically blood that has been processed to remove the cells – for evidence that at some point you’ve been infected with the coronavirus.  These tests look for antibodies that your body’s immune system generated to fight the infection. So, the tests detect the response to the virus, not the virus itself. They cannot be used early in infection, before a patient’s body has mounted an antibody response.  A serological test may focus on different types of antibodies. It can measure what are called neutralizing antibodies, which protect against the virus in question. Or it may measure what are called binding antibodies, a type that recognizes SARS-CoV-2 but does not necessarily protect against it.  Several types of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 exist. Clinical laboratories and research laboratories typically use what’s called an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that consists of plastic plates that are coated with lab-made proteins that match those on the surface of the virus. For the test to be specific, it uses the spike protein from the surface of SARS-CoV-2 that gives the coronavirus its crown-like appearance.  This spike protein is immunogenic, meaning it’s one of the main targets of the body’s immune response; an infected person would make antibodies against the spike protein. The test measures if and how many serum antibodies in the sample bind to the viral proteins on the plates.  Another type of serological test uses what’s called a lateral flow assay. A variety of medical tests, including at-home pregnancy tests, use this technique. It relies on liquid flowing over a pad treated with chemicals that will interact with the molecule you are testing for. Usually the test will indicate the presence or absence of antibodies through easy-to-read lines. They have the benefit of being relatively simple and rapid, but are generally less sensitive and do not give a measure of the amount of antibody present. The FDA has so far approved one test of this type, from the company Cellex.  Why is it helpful to know who has antibodies against the virus?  From a public health perspective, knowing who has already been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 paints a clearer picture of how widespread the virus is in the local population.  Some people are asymptomatic or only came down with mild symptoms, so they might not be counted in other COVID-19 statistics. Epidemiologists can use the serology results to determine how common those cases are. Serological studies can also help figure out a death rate for COVID-19, by clarifying how many people in total have been sick.  Serosurveys are currently generating this kind of data. They use the serological techniques to test a large number of serum samples from people without a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, coming up with statistics about the group as a whole.  Knowing a true rate of infection allows public health workers to better predict the likely future course of the pandemic in individual locations and figure out what interventions are needed to control an outbreak. That’s because researchers think, although no one’s entirely sure yet, that once you have antibodies to the virus it will confer immunity, meaning you’ll be protected for some period of time.  Serological testing could also be used to make strategic staffing decisions about essential workers, including medical personnel – for instance, assigning to the front lines those who are have antibodies and are thus presumably immune. These people would be able to go back to work without the risk of getting sick or infecting others.  Identifying individuals who were already infected and who are now potentially immune could play an important part in when and how social distancing restrictions are lifted. Broad SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing could help control the pandemic until a potent vaccine is available – the real coronavirus “end game.”  Where are these tests being performed so far?  Serological testing is already being used to identify people who can serve as plasma donors.  In a process called plasmapheresis, doctors transfer plasma that contains antibodies to a disease into an ill person. Plasmapheresis has been used for decades to treat a variety of diseases.  In this case, plasma from someone who has recovered from COVID-19 – or was infected with the disease but didn’t develop symptoms and has a high level of antibodies – is transferred into a sick patient, typically someone critically ill. At Mount Sinai hospital in New York City, medical workers have started transferring plasma into patients with the hope of neutralizing the virus and alleviating the disease. In other locations, hospitals have started or are preparing to begin this process as well.  Serological testing is also being used to diagnose individual patients who are suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases, but have not tested positive for the virus using the molecular test that looks for the virus’s genetic material.  Multiple serosurveys are underway, or soon will be, in medical systems and in the general population. For instance, Beaumont Hospital System in Michigan has begun a large serosurvey in their medical staff. The Krammer and Simon research labs at Mount Sinai have started a serosurvey with samples from New York City.  Commercial companies have also developed serological tests, including many rapid tests, that are making their way into the marketplace. Ultimately these may be very useful for letting individuals know their infection status. But the currently available commercial tests haven’t been validated by the FDA or a similar authority to say they work well.  There is such high, unmet demand that for the most part, clinical laboratories are choosing to put together their own serological tests, using publicly available instructions, something which is common in research laboratories, but not done as often in U.S. clinical laboratories. Though it takes more time and effort than purchasing ready-to-go tests, which are hard to come by anyway, it provides the clinical labs access to serological tests that have been proven to work well.

In short order, Gen. Leslie Groves was placed in charge of the project, with Dr. Robert Oppenheimer his lead scientist.  The Manhattan Project successfully developed the atomic bomb, which, in turn, ended World War II. The bomb was employed not to stop the Germans, who had already surrendered, but to vanquish a merciless enemy that wouldn’t surrender: imperial Japan.  Now, in 2020, President Donald Trump has launched an effective Manhattan Project to stop COVID-19. It’s called Operation Warp Speed, an all-out effort to develop a vaccine to vanquish a merciless enemy. The analogy fits because the battle against this virus is a war. We’ve lost more Americans in a few weeks from COVID-19 than we lost in over a decade in Vietnam.  Our commander in chief is marshaling and enlisting America’s best to wage a counteroffensive. According to one senior administration official, when President Trump was asked what he wanted to pour into the effort, he responded, “No limit. Whatever you can humanly do.” Trump asserted, “We’re going to fast-track it like you’ve never seen before, if we come up with a vaccine.”  Trumps knows that a vaccine 18 months from now is too late. Too many people are dying right now. Operation Warp Speed aims to produce hundreds of millions of doses of viable vaccine by the end of the year, which is not unrealistic, as many promising projects are in the works in the United States and around the world. The goal: 100 million doses available by November, 200 million by December, and 300 million by January.  The president’s medical advisers are wholly supportive. Of course, who wouldn’t be? Trump’s action is proactive, aggressive, impressive, and should be greeted with gratitude.  And yet, the immediate pushback by the liberal media has been outrageous.  “Trump Seeks Push to Speed Vaccine, Despite Safety Concerns,” warns the New York Times. As if safety concerns aren’t being considered. Really, New York Times?  The awful MSNBC asserts, “Vaccine expert: ‘Using terms like ‘Operation Warp Speed,’ that doesn’t help us.” Hmm. How about “Operation Take Your Damned Deadly Time”? Or “Operation Twiddle Your Thumbs”?  The Washington Post was a little more creative in its dissent, cherry-picking an example from 1976 with this laugher of a headline: “The last time the government sought a ‘warp speed’ vaccine, it was a fiasco.”  The Post seized upon President Gerald Ford’s push for a swine flu vaccine. Memo to the Post: Swine flu’s fatality rate is 0.2 percent. Current estimates on the fatality rate of COVID-19 in the United States are near 6 percent and over 10 percent in seven Western European countries. That’s why Donald Trump — and normal people whose thinking isn’t poisoned by political bias — is calling for this mass-scale effort. This isn’t swine flu, dude.  A second memo to the Post: Your hero FDR, led by his aide Basil O’Connor, poured everything into a warp-speed vaccine effort by Dr. Jonas Salk. That effort eradicated polio. It wasn’t a fiasco. It was a great triumph.  But of course, FDR was a Democrat.  Other liberal media sources (CNN, among others) criticized Trump’s “blank check” mentality. These big-government progressives suddenly sound like small-government libertarians worried about public spending. They evoke LBJ’s Gulf of Tonkin resolution — a dangerous stream of blank checks flowing into a wasteful effort that undermines human lives.  Personally, I’d like to see these journalists take a pledge that if and when vaccines are developed from this effort, they’ll stick to the liberal faith and not stick out their arm for inoculation. After all, such a vaccine would be more than tainted; it would be a wretched TRUMP VACCINE. Like treatment with HCQ (hydroxychloroquine), they should refuse it under any circumstances. Stick to the faith, dear progressive.  It all reminds me of the response to Ronald Reagan’s announcement of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), which was immediately ridiculed. If SDI had been announced by a Democrat, liberals would have hailed it as a visionary breakthrough for humanity. Had a John F. Kennedy announced SDI, liberal actors at the Grammys would have sported little yellow “Support SDI” pins. When a Democrat like a Kennedy announces an ambition to go to the moon, liberals never deride the dream as fantasy; no, here’s a visionary’s visionary. All aboard!  Speaking of a Kennedy, the morning after Reagan’s groundbreaking SDI speech, Ted Kennedy on the Senate floor lampooned Reagan’s “reckless Star Wars schemes.” The arrogant, ignorant Kennedy couldn’t recognize a silver bullet against Soviet communism dropped before his very eyes. The entirety of the Democrat media followed suit, blasting Reagan’s “Star Wars.” How shocking it was: Reagan had proposed something that anti-nuke liberals ought to have celebrated. Their caricature was a huge propaganda boost to Yuri Andropov, who portrayed SDI as offensive rather than defensive. Reagan objected to this “image of destruction” conjured up by Kennedy and pals. “I’m talking about a weapon, non-nuclear [that] only destroys other weapons, doesn’t kill people,” Reagan protested. “SDI isn’t about war, it’s about peace.” He complained that the term “Star Wars” was “never mine” but the media’s, “and now they saddle me with it.”  Precisely. But the problem for liberals wasn’t really Reagan’s idea, but that Reagan was a Republican. Ideologically and thus emotionally (liberalism is driven by emotion), they couldn’t bring themselves to support it.  That brings us to Trump’s Manhattan Project for COVID-19. If Andrew Cuomo had proposed Operation Warp Speed, the left-wing media mafia would be hailing his genius. Another visionary’s visionary — another Jack Kennedy, by golly! If the president proposing this was Barack Obama, the ideological charlatans in Oslo would be chiseling out a second Nobel Peace Prize.  But here, too, the problem for liberals isn’t really Trump’s idea, but that the idea is Trump’s. He cannot be granted credit. His effort must be scoffed at.  Which also signals what will happen if Trump’s grandiose hopes pan out, particularly before the election. Watch: If Trump’s giant research bid directly aids the creation of a vaccine, liberals will be hell-bent on denying him credit. Watch for the slick “investigative” piece by the New York Times artfully explaining (with selective details) why Vaccine A or B had nothing to do with bloviating Donald Trump’s reckless gambit. The remainder of the partisan media will invoke the report like holy writ. Trump’s crusade for a vaccine will be framed as a colossal waste of cash that could’ve gone to education or Planned Parenthood, a gross seizure of executive power that was utterly unnecessary.  But enough on the lousy media.  What’s really important here is the noble cause that Donald Trump is pursuing. Even conflicted journalists know in their hearts that Trump wants what we all want, namely, to quote CNN: “The undertaking can make for a daunting timeline, but vaccines are seen as the holy grail. If the U.S. population can be successfully vaccinated for the coronavirus, that would make it easier for the country to fully reopen.”  Of course. And likewise, we know the risk of rushing vaccines. Donald Trump’s medical advisers know that. The FDA knows. The CDC knows.  “We want to go quickly, but we want to make sure it’s safe and it’s effective,” cautions Dr. Anthony Fauci. “I think that is doable if things fall in the right place. Remember, go back in time, I was saying in January and February that it would be a year to 18 months (to develop a vaccine), so January is a year, so it isn’t that much from what I had originally said.”  Precisely. I wrote here weeks ago about the potential vaccine that University of Pittsburgh researchers believe they had practically right out of the gate. This timeline is very feasible.  President Trump’s call for a Manhattan Project–like crash effort to defeat this malicious enemy is to be cheered. If his name were Cuomo or Obama, liberals would be shouting, “Warp-speed ahead!” To resist this effort because it’s Trump’s effort is, well, warped. In fact, to borrow another quip from this pandemic, it’s a little sick.

He was referring to the fact that the HSE’s app, which is now several weeks overdue having being first announced at end March, will switch from its initial approach which would have involved maintaining citizens’ data - including phone numbers and health status - in a Government databank to one which would see effective contact tracing managed directly from smartphones.  That change of tack, which would see the HSE’s app running in alignment with the favoured approach of tech giants Apple and Google (who have engaged in a rare collaboration in an attempt to create a tracing standard for their smartphones) has not been officially confirmed, though multiple independent sources have insisted that such a move is inevitable.  Until now the HSE had declined to publish either the application’s source code or its GDPR-mandated data protection impact assessment (DPIA).  Publishing the code is seen as best practice internationally in order to ensure public oversight of how a citizen’s data will be used by such an application.  “This thing cannot work unless it’s transparent,” Mr O’Brien, who had described the initial scope of the application as representing “a potential car crash”, said.  “What we need is to have Tony Holohan (the chief medical officer) hold a press conference with a slideshow saying ‘this is the app, and this is what it will do’. And we urgently need the DPIA to be released.”  Official details as to how the HSE’s app - known as CovidTracker Ireland - will work in practice are few on the ground.  The executive said earlier this month that the application would “help the health service with its efforts in contact tracing for people who are confirmed cases” while at the same time “maximising privacy”, with “privacy-by-design a core principle” of the project.  - Read full analysis on this story in tomorrow's Irish Examiner print edition   [snippet1]987600[/snippet1]  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 9, "positive": 13, "negative": 1, "joy": 1, "surprise": 1, "fear": 4, "trust": 4}, "metadata": ["officially", "tracking", "ensure", "app", "tracing", "google", "oversight"]}, {"text": "This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated.

Health Officer Mark Wilson said nonessential businesses have until March 23 at 5 p.m. to close its doors due to the coronavirus outbreak. County officials and state leaders have been administering social distancing guidelines to stop the spread of the virus.  “I want to be very clear,” Wilson said, “This is a matter of life and death.”  The order does not include grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations, hardware, building supplies and office supply stores, also known as essential businesses during the outbreak however many have asked what is included in nonessential.  This may be a time to reflect on what is considered a need and a want in order to live a healthy lifestyle without being exposed to the coronavirus.  “This is not a time to look for loopholes. I cannot possibly list each and every business so I need your help using good judgment to do everything you can to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” Wilson said.

The country's death toll hit 3,405 as of Thursday, an increase of 427 compared to Wednesday, according to Italy’s Civil Protection Department.  Italy has been staggering under the effects of the pandemic for weeks. Hospitals and even some morgues in the hard-hit northern Italian city of Milan are stretched beyond capacity.  Health officials are searching for new ways to get more doctors in the field, ranging from calling recent retirees back to work to rushing as many as 10,000 soon-to-graduate students into low-leverage situations before they finish with exams as a way to free up more experienced colleagues.  The entire population of more than 60 million is under lockdown, allowed to leave home only for \"essential\" activities like visits to grocery stores or pharmacies. Police and the military are roaming the streets on the lookout for people breaking quarantine. Everything from open restaurants and coffee bars to weddings and funerals is prohibited.  \"It’s so frightening. I keep worrying they aren’t telling us everything. If they are, then why do so many people keep dying?\" said Rome native Annalisa De Crescenzo, 30, a legal secretary. \"I feel fine. I keep telling myself that so I’ll stay calm. But I’m worried.\"  On Wednesday, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said that the lockdown measures would be extended beyond their original April 3 deadline, and government officials said additional steps could be taken – such as limiting hours supermarkets can be open and closing urban parks – if current measures prove inadequate.  \"The death toll is rising from people who were infected before the national lockdown\" on March 9, Angelo Borrelli, head of Italy’s Civil Protection Department, said on Wednesday, when the death toll jumped by 475, the highest one-day total so far in Italy. He was referencing the estimated 12- to 14-day incubation period for the virus.  \"We still believe that once we are 14 days out from the lockdown we will begin to see a significant drop in the death toll,\" Borrelli said.  One factor in the high death toll so far is the high median age in Italy, which is 47 years, compared to 37 in China and 38 in the U.S. Stated as a percentage of the total population, Italy has more people over the age of 80, 90, or 100 than any other major industrialized country except Japan. With the average age of a COVID-19 victim in Italy over 80, that is a factor, with most of the elderly victims already suffering from serious underlying medical conditions such as cancer, diabetes, or hypertension.  As of Thursday, China’s total death toll from the coronavirus was 3,245. But the total number of people infected by the virus in China is more than twice the number in Italy and China’s population is nearly 25 orders of magnitude larger than Italy's population of 61 million people.  The figures are a stark illustration of how the virus has swept through communities at breakneck speed, upending daily routines, wiping billions of dollars off of stock markets and threatening to usher in the most serious economic recession in decades.  A number of factors are being blamed for why the virus has taken hold in Italy with such ferocity, in addition to its large elderly population. They include an utterly overwhelmed health care system and a failure to quickly impose a full national lockdown on its citizens.  Italian authorities began enforcing their national lockdown on March 9, 21 days after the point where community transmission, defined as more than 100 cases, had taken hold, according to World Health Organization data analyzed by USA TODAY.  The restrictions were tightened further on March 12.  Data analysis by USA TODAY finds that, two weeks after the U.S. first entered into community transmission on March 3, America’s trajectory is trending toward Italy’s.  One-hundred-sixty people have died from coronavirus in the U.S.  Italy's death-toll milestone comes on the same day that authorities in China announced that, for the first time, the city of Wuhan and the surrounding province where the coronavirus outbreak began in December, reported no new domestic cases.  It is the first time that China's National Commission has reported no domestically transmitted cases of the virus since it started recording them in January.  But the announcement also comes as China, South Korea, and Singapore faced a spike in infections from abroad that could be the start of a second coronavirus wave. And in China's case, it's also not clear how reliable its data is because the country has clamped down hard on domestic and foreign reporting on the virus. Beijing has said that of China's more than 81,000 infections, some 70,000 have recovered.  Places in Asia such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Japan have been praised for their quick and effective testing, tracing and \"social distancing\" measures. China aggressively deployed similar tactics. However, while a lack of new domestic infections will buoy hopes that the pandemic can be beaten, the fact that China recorded Thursday 34 cases from people who returned from abroad will concern public health experts. Singapore and South Korea also recorded new \"foreign\" cases.

Asked if the US would consider doing the same, Trump said “we can do something much easier than that.”  READ ALSO: Churches, mosques remain closed despite partial lockdown – Buhari  “Germany is looking at things, we are looking at things,” he said. “We haven’t determined the final amount yet,” Trump said.  In Beijing, a foreign ministry spokesman on Tuesday accused US politicians of “telling barefaced lies”, without naming Trump specifically, and of ignoring their “own serious problems”.  “American politicians have repeatedly ignored the truth and have been telling barefaced lies,” Geng Shuang told reporters at a regular press briefing.  “They have only one objective: shirk their responsibility for their own poor epidemic prevention and control measures, and divert public attention.”  Geng said US politicians should “reflect on their own problems and find ways to contain the outbreak as quickly as possible.”  – Tensions and doubt –  There have been nearly a million infections with more than 56,000 coronavirus-related deaths in the United States and the pandemic has shut down huge swathes of the economy.  In China, the outbreak seems to be under control with no new deaths reported for 13 straight days and the toll standing at 4,633 — although several countries have cast doubt over whether the numbers are accurate.  Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo angered Beijing last month by repeatedly referring to “the Chinese virus” when discussing the COVID-19 outbreak – although they later appeared to drop the term.  But a foreign ministry spokesman in Beijing later suggested that it was the US military which brought the virus to Wuhan — prompting angry claims from Trump that China was spreading misinformation.  Since then the US president has repeatedly attacked China’s lack of transparency and the slowness of its initial response to the outbreak.  Claims from the US that the virus actually originated in a virology institute in Wuhan with a high-security biosafety laboratory have also been angrily refuted in China.

Their addiction to smartphones and other wireless devices blinded them to the adverse health effects caused by the sudden influx of 5G energies (which include extremely high radiofrequency signal ranges and ultra-high microwave transmission) when they flipped the switch in 2019 in Hubei Province.  In general, 5G Flu is more of an acute illness whereas 5G Syndrome is a long-term, chronic disease. They mutually support and feed off each other which is what makes them so dangerous and increasingly fatal. A person who has 5G Syndrome is much more susceptible to contracting 5G Flu. And, a person with 5G Flu is a good candidate for developing 5G Syndrome.  One who repeatedly gets the Wuhan coronavirus (or 5G Flu), as many Chinese sufferers have to date, will exhibit a greater likelihood of developing 5G Syndrome; that is, if they do not already have a case of it. The extraordinary re-infection rates for COVID-19, also known as the coronavirus bioweapon triggering 5G Flu, offer compelling circumstantial evidence that it’s really an electromagnetic radiation-driven disease more than a bioengineered coronavirus; although, it’s really both co-factors working in tandem to turbo-charge each other.  Truly, the ‘inexplicable’ re-infection rates tell the hidden back story about this swiftly unfolding pandemic. The only plausible reason for multiple re-infections, when compared to all previously studied coronavirus outbreaks prior to the WiFi era, is that the former virus patients have stepped back into their wireless environment, live in a 5G hotspot or they still sleep with their smartphones turned on.  5G Syndrome insidiously develops over a period of sustained exposure to a 5G power grid and/or usage of even a small-scale version of a home-based or a full-scale office build-out of the Internet of Things. The longer any individual sits in those unsafe levels of 5G energies, the more likely they will experience the evolution of their own unique form of 5G Syndrome. Eventually, they will become vulnerable to not only 5G Flu (i.e. Wuhan coronavirus), but also to the whole host of other bioengineered flu strains and naturally occurring influenzas.  The most critical point here is that every long-term, habitual smartphone user is at great risk for developing either 5G Flu and 5G Syndrome, or both! Therefore, the best advice from The Coronavirus Coach is:   “Give up the smartphone—ASAP!”   The symptoms of both  What will eventually follow in this blog is a list of symptoms of both 5G Flu and 5G Syndrome which will distinguish the one medical ailment from the other. Inevitably, there will be many symptoms that overlap for obvious reasons, but even those will have subtle differences to the trained clinician.  This future list of 5G symptoms will by no means be exhaustive and will be added to in the weeks and months and years ahead. Its compilation represents a collaborative effort among many like-minded healthcare professionals and health advocates who deeply understand the intimate connection between the human bio-organism and ambient electromagnetic fields.  These medical clinicians, alternative healthcare practitioners and biomedical researchers are especially aware of the numerous adverse health effects and profound environmental impacts produced by the rapidly emerging 5G power grid. Connecting the most crucial dots has become easier as the 5G roll-out takes place in cities nationwide as well as worldwide.  China has provided an excellent observation laboratory with the Wuhan 5G Demonstration Zone being the most watched experiment in the world today. Some have even noted that the Wuhanese have sacrificed themselves for the sake of enlightening the rest of humanity. Now it’s time for the Chinese government to share the medical data and scientific observations so that their 5G roll-out can be properly implicated in this paralyzing public health crisis.  There are many symptoms which constitute either the 5G Flu or 5G Syndrome symptom set, as well as those that are common to both. The due diligence process and proper vetting required to confirm them with a highly level of integrity is quite tedious and challenging. Nevertheless, this project is proceeding with all deliberate speed in the interest of precluding a public health disaster of epic proportions. Our real intention is to avert a full-blown ELE (Extinction Level Event) in light of the 5G juggernaut rolling across the land on all 7 continents.

The company said it received FDA approval late Friday night to deploy its test — designed to operate on the company’s automated GeneXpert Systems — that can get results in 45 minutes in a hospital laboratory.  The test will begin being shipped to hospital next week.  “An accurate test delivered close to the patient can be transformative — and help alleviate the pressure that the emergence of the 2019-nCoV outbreak has put on healthcare facilities that need to properly allocate their respiratory isolation resources,” said Dr. David Persing, Chief Medical and Technology Officer at Cepheid in a news release. “We have developed a test that provides reference lab-quality results in multiple settings where actionable treatment information is needed quickly.”  There are about 23,000 of those systems throughout the world, of which 5,000 are in the United States, according to the company.  The FDA authorization covers patient care settings including doctors’ offices, but initially will be used primarily by hospitals and emergency departments, the company said.  Unlike current tests, the Cepheid test does not require a nasal swab; nasal aspirate can be used. Officials said the CDC rules on who can be tested will still apply.  Officials were also imploring people who don’t really need tests, to refrain from getting one.  “In a universe where masks and gowns are starting to become scarce, every time we test someone who doesn’t need one, we’re taking that mask and gown away from someone in the intensive care unit,” said Demetre Daskalakis, deputy commissioner for the Division of Disease Control of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.

And the Big Apple was (still is?) the biggest hotspot in the country with some of the highest population density imaginable. If they can pull out of this nosedive, anyplace should be able to, perhaps even sooner than predicted.  With that in mind, Karol Markowicz at the New York Post has a very important question for not just the Mayor, the Governor, and President Trump, but for all of us. Is there a plan for how we will start reopening businesses and allowing people to return to work when the coast is at least mostly clear?

[1] COVID-19 is incredibly contagious.  COVID-19 transmits extremely easily from person to person. Interpersonal contact doesn’t need to be very long; a taxi driver can get the virus from a passenger, for example. The virus may be transmissible even before an infected person develops symptoms. It may also be transmissible for a few days after a person seems to be over the virus; it is possible to get positive virus tests, even after symptoms disappear. Some people may have the disease, but never show symptoms.  [2] The virus likely remains active on inanimate surfaces such as paper, plastic, or metal for many days.  There haven’t been tests on the COVID-19 virus per se, but studies on similar viruses suggest that human pathogens may remain infectious for up to eight days. Some viruses that only infect animals can survive for more than 28 days. China is reported to be destroying paper currency from the hardest hit area, because people do not want to accept money which may have viruses on it. Clearly, surfaces in airplanes, trains and buses may also harbor viruses, long after a passenger with the virus has left, unless they have been thoroughly wiped down with disinfectant.  [3] Given Issues [1] and [2], about the only way to avoid spreading COVID-19 seems to be geographic isolation.  With all of today’s travel, geographic isolation doesn’t work very well in practice. People need food and medical supplies. They need to keep basic services such as electricity and garbage collection operating. Suppliers of food and other services need to come and leave the area and that tends to spread COVID-19. Also, the longer a geographic area is isolated, the larger the percentage of the people within the area that is likely to get COVID-19. The problem is that the people need to have contact with others in the area for purposes such as buying food, and that tends to spread the disease.  [4] The real story regarding the number of deaths and illnesses seems to be far worse than the story China is telling its own people and the world.  The real story seems to be that the number of deaths is far greater than the number reported–perhaps 10 times as high as being reported. The number of illnesses is also much higher. At one point, facilities doing cremations in the Wuhan area were reported to be doing four to five times the normal number of cremations. Some of the bodies in the Wuhan area now need to be sent to other areas of China because there is not enough local cremation capacity.  China doesn’t dare tell its people how bad the situation really is, for fear of panic. They want to tell a story of being in control and handling the situation well. The news media in the West repeat the stories that the government-controlled publications of China provide, even though they seem to present a much more favorable situation than really seems to be the case.  [5] Our ability to identify who has the new coronavirus is poor.  While there is a test for the coronavirus, it costs hundreds of dollars to administer. Even with this high cost, the results of the tests aren’t very reliable. The test tends to produce many false negatives. The virus may be present somewhere inside the person being tested, but not in the areas touched by swabs of the throat and nose.  [6] Some people get much more severe symptoms from COVID-19 than others.  Most people, perhaps 80% of people, seem to get a fairly light form of the COVID-19 illness. Groups that seem particularly prone to adverse outcomes include the elderly, smokers, those who are obese, and those with high blood pressure, diabetes, or poor immune systems. Males seem to have worse outcomes than females.  Strangely enough, people with East Asian ancestry (Chinese, Japanese, or Vietnamese) may have a higher risk of adverse outcomes than those of European or African ancestry. One of the things that is targeted by the disease is the ACE2 receptor. The 1000 Genome Project studied expected differences in ACE2 receptors among various groups. Based on this analysis, some researchers predict that those of European or African ancestry will tend to get lighter forms of the disease.  Figure 1. Chart from Coronavirus risk for Asians, Africans, Caucasians revealed.  Bolstering this view is the fact that the SARS, which also tends to target the ACE2 receptor, tended to stay primarily in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore. While there were cases elsewhere, they tended to have few deaths.  [7] China has been using geographical quarantine to try to hold down the number of COVID-19 cases. The danger with such a quarantine is that once the economy is down, it is very difficult to come back to the pre-quarantine state.  Data shows that China’s economy is not reopening quickly after the extended New Year holiday finished.  Figure 2. China daily passenger flows, relative to Chinese New Year. Amounts are now down more than 80% and have not increased, even as some businesses are theoretically reopening. Chart by ANZ, copied by WSJ Daily Shot Feb. 17, 2020.  Figure 3.

All businesses will be adversely affected by a lack of sales if they need to continue to pay overhead expenses. Small and medium-sized business will be especially adversely affected. Bloomberg reports that if a shutdown lasts for three months, there is a substantial chance that these businesses will run through their savings and fail. Thus, these businesses may be permanently lost if the economy is down for several months.  Also, restarting after a shut-down is more difficult than it might appear. Take, for example, a mother who wants to go back to work. She will likely need:  Public transportation to be operating, so she has a way to get to work;  School to be open, so she doesn’t need to worry about her child while she is at work;  Masks to be available, so that she and her child can comply with requirements to wear them;  Stores providing necessities such as food to be open, or she may be too hungry to work  If anything is missing, the mother is likely not to go back to work. Required masks seem to be a problem right now, but other pieces could be missing as well.  Businesses, too, need a full range of workers to restart their operations. If the inspector doing the final inspection is not available, the business may not really be able to ship finished products, even if most of the workers are back.  [8] A shutdown of as little as three months is likely to be damaging to the world economy.  Multiple things are likely to go wrong:  (a) Commodity prices are likely to fall steeply, because of low demand from China. Oil prices, in particular, are likely to fall steeply, perhaps to $30 to $35 per barrel. Besides cutbacks in oil demand from China, there is the issue of a general reduction in long distance travel, because of fear of traveling with other passengers with COVID-19. (b) US businesses, such as Apple, will find their supply chains broken. They won’t know when, and if, they can ship products. (c) Debt defaults are likely to become more common, especially in China. The longer the slowdown/shutdown lasts, the greater the extent to which debt defaults are likely to spread around the world. (d) The world economy is likely to be pushed into recession, without an easy way to get out again.  [9] The longer the shutdown lasts, the more likely there is to be a major collapse of the Chinese economy.  In the event of a long-term shutdown, it would seem likely that, at a minimum, a new leader would take over. In fact, there would seem to be a significant chance of major changes within the economy. For example, the provinces of China that are able to restart might attempt to restart, leaving the more damaged areas behind. In such a case, instead of having a single Chinese government to deal with, there might be multiple governmental units to deal with.  Each governmental unit might consist of a few provinces trying to provide services such as they are able, without the benefit of the parts of the economy that are still shut down. Each governmental unit might have its own currency. If this should happen, China will be able to provide far fewer goods and services than it has in the recent past.  [10] Planners everywhere have been guilty of “putting too many eggs in one basket.”  Planners today look for efficiency. For example, placing a large share of the world’s industry in China looks like it is an efficient approach. Unfortunately, we are asking for trouble if the Chinese economy hits a bump in the road. Using just-in-time supply lines looks like a good idea as well, but if a major supplier cannot provide parts for a while, then having inventory on hand would have been a better approach.  If we want systems to be sustainable, they really need a lot of redundancy. Redundant systems are not as efficient, but they are much more likely to sustainable through difficult times. There is a recent article in Nature that talks about this issue. One of the things it says is,  A system with a single cycle is the most unstable because the deletion of any cycle-node or link breaks the sustaining feedback mechanism.  “A system with a single cycle” is basically similar to “putting all of our eggs in one basket.” “Deletion of any cycle-node or link” is something like China running into coronavirus problems. We probably need a world economy that consists of many nearly separate local economies to be certain of long-term world economy stability. Alternatively, we need a great deal of redundancy built into our systems. For example, we need large inventories to work around the possibility of missing contributions from one country, in the case of a problem such as a major epidemic.   Conclusion  The world economy may become very different, simply because of COVID-19. The new virus doesn’t even need to directly affect the rest of the world very much to create a problem. The United States, Europe, and the rest of the world are very much dependent on the continued operation of China. The world economy has effectively put way too many eggs in one basket, and this basket is not now functioning as expected.  If China is barely producing anything for world markets, the rest of the world will suddenly discover that long supply chains weren’t such a good idea. There will be a big scramble to try to fill in the missing pieces of supply chains, but many goods are likely to be less available. We may discover quickly how much we depend upon China for everything from shoes to automobiles to furniture to electronics. World carbon dioxide emissions are likely to fall dramatically because of China’s problems, but will the accompanying issues be ones that the world economy can tolerate?  The thing that is ironic is that it is possible that the West’s fear of the new coronavirus may be overblown–we really won’t know what the impact will be with respect to people of European or of African descent until we have had a better chance to examine how the virus affects different populations. The next few weeks and months are likely to be quite instructive. For example, how will the Americans and Australians who caught COVID-19 on the cruise ships fare? What will the health outcomes be of non-Asians being brought back from Wuhan to their native countries on special planes?

While a new social solidarity and spirit of self-sacrifice seem to be manifesting themselves in this pandemic, can it endure?  Is the country prepared for months, or years, of social isolation, if that is what is required to win this war?  It is a question that needs to be addressed.  Consider. The Chinese government, whose word is admittedly suspect, claims to have achieved a deceleration in the daily number of new coronavirus infections. The South Koreans say they, too, have broken and reversed the momentum of the spread of the virus.  On March 3, the number of new cases of the coronavirus reported across South Korea was 852. On St. Patrick’s Day, March 17, exactly two weeks later, the count was 85 new cases, a plunge of 90%.  South Korea appears to have “flattened the curve.”  We Americans, however, are far from that.  Exactly how far behind South Korea we are cannot be known until more tens of thousands of Americans are tested, and we learn how many cases of the disease are out there undiscovered and unreported.  But whatever the success of Asian nations in containing the virus, are we politically and socially able to impose the same draconian measures?  Ordering people to “shelter in place” in their own homes, not just for days or weeks but months — can this be done in a free society, as it can be done in the surveillance state of Communist China?  Can mayors and governors of beach towns along the East Coast from Maine to Miami, and the Gulf Coast from Florida to Texas, keep tens of millions from gathering on beaches this summer?  Last week, we saw college kids cavorting on Florida’s beaches, despite warnings that any one among them infected with COVID-19 could transmit it to the rest, leading to grave illness and, in some cases, death.  Moreover, they could become carriers of the disease to parents and siblings. They did not seem to care.  As Prohibition proved, Americans are a rule-breaking people. Churchill, Hitler, and...

Scores of thousands are injured in auto accidents and thousands killed each year from driving under the influence of alcohol, despite tough laws against drunk driving.  Since the 1960s, laws against the use of marijuana, cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, have not halted the rampant ingestion of illegal narcotics and dangerous drugs.  We are endlessly admonished that climate change poses an existential threat to the planet. But have the elites who profess to believe this given up flying in private jets? Have Americans given up their SUVs or ceased to heat their homes with oil and gas?

Is the crowd on Martha’s Vineyard going to give up socializing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus?  In the ’60s, we were told that the correlation between cigarette smoking and lung cancer, emphysema and heart disease, is absolute. Yet 34 million Americans continue to risk shortening their lives by smoking.  Seniors and elderly, among whom the mortality rate from the coronavirus is the highest — 15% of those over 80 in one estimate — may shelter in place for months.  But if, in diverse cities, minority communities come out for block parties in summer, are we going to have the police march them back into their homes? Do we have enough cops for that?  A prediction: The longer the orders to shelter in place and self-isolate remain in force, the greater the probability they will begin to be ignored and people will take the risks to end their isolation and be with friends.  Will Americans suffer in social isolation, inside their own homes for months, while a state-induced Great Depression washes over the land?  My guess is that many will rebel.  The Best of Patrick J.

Such unprecedented suppression of civil and economic liberties during peace continue to strike many as hardly justified. Whether from a legal, ethical, or economic standpoint, we may soon find that the cost of the policy reaction was immense and grave. We have yet to see the real toll of the draconian confinement measures taken to stop the contagion. A high price must also be paid for the gargantuan financial and fiscal packages supposed to alleviate the impact of the largely self-inflicted economic crisis.  But not all regimes have taken this path. Several Asian countries at the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, in particular Korea and Japan but also Taiwan and Hong Kong, have not instituted general lockdowns. Most reacted early with widespread testing, tracking, and isolating only those found positive for the virus. These countries were able to avoid a major contagion and the number of infections and fatalities have remained low so far. At the same time, social and economic activity have continued largely unobstructed. Korea is now widely hailed as a success story, whereas the self-declared victory of China is being questioned.   What Do Statistics Show?  It should be noted that health statistics are not fully comparable internationally with regard to both infected persons and fatalities. Countries are using different approaches to testing and tracing as well as various standards for classifying fatalities by cause. On top of these discrepancies, China’s official statistics are highly unreliable. Yet, corroborated with anecdotal evidence, they can still give us a broad picture.  China’s initial reaction was slow and nontransparent. The first cases of the disease were identified in early December, but measures were not taken until one month later. Strict mobility restrictions and lockdowns were put in place, not only in the city of Wuhan and the Hubei region, but in the entire country. The number of confirmed cases increased exponentially until mid-February, after which it plateaued at about 80,000 cases (57 cases per million inhabitants, Graph 1), decelerating markedly in March (Graph 4). If accurate, the official number of fatalities remained limited at about 4 percent of cases (Graph 2). Nevertheless, both China’s official statistics and its alleged successful exit are seriously questioned. There are still new cases every day, and these could be imported, but could also stem from domestic unreported asymptomatic cases. Recently cinemas were closed after being reopened, and a small county in the Henan Province went into lockdown. These anecdotes fuel obvious fears of a possible second wave of infections, which represents an Achilles’s heel for a mass confinement strategy that prevents the majority of the population from building immunity against the virus.  Other Asian countries have managed to contain the spread of the disease so far, even though they did not follow China’s recipe. They have limited the number of infections to relatively low levels despite the fact that they performed many more tests on average (Graph 3). This is particularly the case with South Korea, which conducted more than 300,000 tests, with as many as 10,000 per day already by mid-March. They have also recorded very low numbers of fatalities, clearly outperforming not only Italy, Germany, and the US, but also China. Korea slightly exceeds China in terms of fatalities per population, but this could be explained by China’s less credible statistics. For now, China and Korea seem to be the only two major examples of countries that have mastered the outbreak, with the statistical caveats explained before (Graph 4). Japan’s number of new cases is still rising but rather slowly, which has puzzled health experts.  How Do Health Policies and Exit Strategies Differ?  Economic activity collapsed in China from January to February, following the draconian confinement measures. China’s leadership declared the lockdown a success, claimed victory in the fight against COVID-19, and gradually reopened social and economic life. However, many restrictions remain in place. Restaurants and shops are reopening, but most schools remain closed and strict social distancing rules still apply. Face masks and widespread temperature checks have become a norm. More widespread testing is pursued and a health color code system using big data is being rolled out, raising privacy issues and concerns about mass surveillance. Attention has shifted to imported cases, and foreigners have been largely banned from entering the country. As fears about a second infection wave persist, China appears to be exiting its lockdown only gradually.  In South Korea, both the government and the private sector reacted very quickly to the distressing news coming from China. As early as January, a private company developed a test for the coronavirus. and within three weeks the regulators approved it with unprecedented speed. This enabled Seoul to roll out a mass public testing program, including drive-through testing facilities, focused on anyone who may have been exposed to the virus. Those found positive were quarantined. The Korean government also conducted intrusive contact tracing to track known and suspected cases alike, using mobile providers and credit cards companies’ data and closed-circuit television (CCTV) networks. When contagion suddenly increased around a religious cult in Daegu, the government sealed it off rapidly. It also extended school and university holidays into late March and shut down religious, sports, and entertainment activities. At the same time, most factories, shopping malls, and restaurants have been kept open. Korea’s success also reflects a very high-performing and to a large extent private health sector, thoroughly upgraded after the MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) epidemics in 2015.  Japan was among the first countries to be hit by the coronavirus, but has not imposed a general lockdown and has not undertaken mass testing either. Despite the cancellation of sports events and the closure of schools, much of Japan’s life continued as normal until early April. There was no quarantine and no enforced closures of bars, clubs or restaurants. Workers still commuted instead of teleworking. Low testing rates may explain the low number of infections, but there is no other evidence of the disease’s spread in other ways, such as an overwhelmed health care system or high fatalities. It seems that Japan has done “just enough” in terms of social distancing and isolation of infected cases, given its culture of good hygiene and limited physical contact. On 7 April, PM Abe announced both a state of emergency over coronavirus and a record stimulus of about USD 1 trillion or 20% of GDP. The stricter measures seemed driven by political expediency and the need to justify the stimulus rather than the evolution of the epidemic. In any case, the new lockdown measures are the domain of local authorities which have the best information to impose them selectively. In addition, they don’t amount to a French-style lockdown as factories, distribution services and public transport are not stopped.  In Taiwan and Hong Kong there have been no general lockdowns either. In general, the health response has focused on early testing, virus mapping, social distancing, and strict hygiene via intensive handwashing and wearing of masks. These countries closed borders and suspended travel from the infected countries. They also used digital technologies and big data to allow for precise live monitoring of the situation and disclosure of information to the general population. Hong Kong, for example, has turned to a police “supercomputer” normally used to investigate complex crimes to trace potential supercarriers and hot spots. All these countries seem to have benefited from a high level of preparedness after similar epidemic outbreaks in the past. Unlike in China, the exit out of the epidemic is likely to be smoother. Because people remain exposed to the virus, in particular the young people, who are likely to develop milder symptoms, herd immunity can be achieved faster. At the same time, widespread testing can help prevent a spike in contagion while social and economic life goes on largely as before. This approach can also mitigate the risk of subsequent waves of reinfection.   Conclusions  The experience of some Asian countries reinforces the arguments against the shutdowns imposed in most of Europe and the US. It shows that the respective governments could have pursued a different path, with likely lower numbers of cases and fatalities, had they been ready to take early and proportionate action. These governments can still change course and emulate the Korean approach rather than following in China’s footsteps, a country previously bashed for its authoritarian regime, nontransparent policies, and unfair competition practices. Concerns about privacy intrusion by using tracking technology should be carefully looked into. Yet such monitoring should be limited in time and probably is less harmful than placing the entire population in confinement. And in a case where a person who has tested positive for the virus represents a “palpable, immediate and direct threat” to the health of others, they are allowed to limit contact with that person within the boundaries of their property rights.  Everyone would like to minimize the risk of infections, the number of deaths, and the negative economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic. However, emotions and political interests should not take over a rational and balanced judgment of all risks involved. Almost two centuries ago, the French economist Frederic Bastiat argued that not looking into all the consequences of an action, including those not immediately seen, can make things worse. The shutdown will make the exit from the epidemic more difficult and at the same time magnifies already high government interventionism. As Mises explained, interventionism begets more of the kind until it ends in full socialism. Thus the war against the coronavirus can easily turn into a war against the overall well-being of the people.

And while everything seems super bleak right now, it doesn’t hurt to take a little effort amidst all the cooking and cleaning, to make sure you look cute. It helps keep your spirits up in these trying times. Celebrities from Alia Bhatt to Deepika Padukone are constantly posting on their social media on how to indulge in some self-care and stay safe. And their no make-up looks in their super cute pyjamas are a pleasant change from the usual severely photoshopped photoshoots they usually keep posting otherwise. So sleepwear as a trend is here to stay.  Deepika stuck to a more minimalistic style of pyjamas as she posted pictures of her indulging in some self-care as she tried to be productive in COVID times. She sported a blue and white striped pyjama set and another black one.  Alia’s cute Panda pyjamas were nice sea green and had prints of tiny pandas all over. The pyjamas are from Dandelion Dreams.  Pyjamas came into the spotlight in a big way in the past few years with brands like Samyukta Nair’s Dandelion Dreams making personalised sleepwear and sending them across to celebrities including Sonam Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Athiya Shetty among others. The trend then hit the runways with international designers and celebrities bringing the humble pyjamas out from the dark and onto the red carpet. In fact, pop icon and Fenty creator, Rihanna was so big on the trend that she was spotted only in Pyjama Couture for the longest time. Other celebrities who have been spotted following the trend are Deepika Padukone, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Priyanka Chopra, Katrina Kaif, to name a few.  We don’t know when the lockdown will end but in the meantime, wear comfortable clothes, indulge in self-care and have a smooth work day from home.  Whose pyjama look do you like best?

Officials across Canada took further steps to help the country's most vulnerable people on Tuesday as signs emerged that COVID-19 will continue to affect daily life for months.  On a day school shutdowns were extended in three provinces and city-led events in Toronto were banned through June 30, British Columbia's top health official said residents should expect restrictions to remain in effect until at least the summer.  \"We are going to be in some form of having to monitor and prevent transmission of this virus until we have a vaccine or until enough of the population is immune to it that it's no longer infecting people,\" Dr. Bonnie Henry said at a news conference.  \"I do think it's more and more less likely that we're going to be able to get back to full normal life, which I miss a lot, before at least the summer. Then we need to start preparing ourselves for the potential of a second wave in the fall.\"  Health-care workers, seniors, Indigenous Peoples and Canadians involved in the correctional system were all singled out as groups facing higher risk of severe impacts from the novel coronavirus.  Quebec, the province at the epicentre of the Canadian outbreak, cautioned that key supplies such as gowns, gloves and masks could be depleted by week's end if not replenished soon. The federal government announced $2 billion and new arrangements with private companies to address the shortfall in Quebec and across Canada.  The country's top doctor, meanwhile, sounded the alarm about the presence of COVID-19 in facilities and communities that are home to some of Canada's most marginalized people.  \"Of greatest concern at the moment relates to the introduction and spread of the virus in enclosed settings where vulnerable people reside,\" said Dr. Theresa Tam. \"We currently have a number of ongoing outbreaks in long-term care homes, cases in First Nations and Inuit communities, and in corrections facilities.\"  Officials in Ontario said COVID-19 has been detected in nearly two dozen of the province's nursing homes to date, including a facility at the centre of one of the country's most devastating clusters.  The doctor overseeing the Pinecrest Nursing Home in Bobcaygeon, Ont., confirmed the virus has killed 12 residents and the spouse of another in recent weeks. At least two dozen employees of the central Ontario facility have also tested positive, according to the local health authority.  The provincial government said the virus has surfaced in at least 23 long-term care homes, with the Deputy Medical Officer of Health saying full-fledged outbreaks have been identified at 10 of those facilities.  Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland flagged another outbreak among health-care workers who live in Ontario but work in the United States. She referenced cases in the border city of Windsor, Ont., but few details were immediately available.  Medical workers are currently among the few people permitted to cross the border after Canada and the U.S. reached a mutual agreement to severely curtail traffic between the two countries.  But such workers also face a growing threat of supply shortfalls on both sides of the border — particularly in the province that remains home to the bulk of Canada's COVID-19 cases.  The Quebec government said it's at risk of running out of personal protective equipment in three to seven days without help, noting health-care workers are using supplies at an unprecedented rate.  \"We're using 10 times more medical equipment as normal,\" said Health Minister Danielle McCann. \"So what we used in one year, we're using in four weeks.\"  Word of the shortage came as Quebec reported 732 new cases of COVID-19 for a total case load of more than 4,100, accounting for nearly half of Canada's nearly 8,500 cases to date. At least 101 people have died as a result of the virus across the country.  The federal government announced further steps to address equipment shortfalls, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announcing that Ottawa had secured agreements with more private-sector organizations to produce the much-needed supplies.  The government said upwards of 60 million N95 masks, a crucial piece of protection for health care workers, are expected to be delivered this week, and at least 500 ventilators are to be added to the national supply.  The $2 billion in additional funding for protective equipment, Trudeau said, was part of an effort to prepare Canada's health-care systems for a worst-case scenario.  He said Canadians could play a role in forestalling that outcome by staying home as much as possible and practising the sort of physical distancing measures public health officials have been touting for weeks.  \"We will need more masks, ventilators and testing kits, but how many more we need depends entirely on you,\" Trudeau said.  \"If you stay home and follow public health recommendations, you can slow the spread.\"  Cries for help also came from Canada's correctional system, with guards at one Ontario jail refusing to work one of their scheduled shifts due to what they describe as a lack of screening.  Ryan Graham, a spokesman for the Ontario Public Service Employees Union, said no one is being screened for COVID-19 symptoms when entering the province's jails. He said failure to do so puts staff and inmates at risk.  \"Everyone is taking precautions everywhere, yet we come to the correctional institutions and we're not taking any precautions,\" he said.  The province's Ministry of the Solicitor General did not immediately respond to questions, but did say it \"takes every possible step to ensure a safe workplace for employees and works to address any safety issues raised.\"  The federal public safety minister also appeared to recognize an imminent threat to inmates, formally asking the federal prison service and the national parole board to look at early release for some offenders. At least one outbreak has been identified at a maximum-security prison in Quebec, where at least two inmates and nine staff have tested positive for COVID-19.  While there was no immediate word on whether Bill Blair's request would be granted, the Union of Canadian Correctional Officers said the focus should be on increasing physical distancing behind bars rather than releasing inmates.  Meanwhile, several provinces showed signs of settling in for longer periods of isolation than originally planned, particularly for students.  Ontario announced that schools would remain closed at least until May 4, while Prince Edward Island said it would keep classrooms shuttered until May 11 at the earliest.  Manitoba went one step further. Education Minister Kelvin Goertzen announced classes would be suspended indefinitely unless public health officials advise they can safely resume.

Speaker N P Prajapati adjourned the House after Legislative Affairs Minister Govind Singh broached the issue of coronavirus scare, saying the World Health Organisation has declared it a pandemic.  In a reminder of the developments in Karnataka last year, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister and senior BJP leader Shivraj Singh Chouhan moved the Supreme Court seeking a direction to the state government to undertake floor test in view of the political crisis in the state.  The plea alleged that the direction Tandon to Nath for conducting a floor test on March 16 was not complied with.  When the Karnataka political crisis was at its peak, the Supreme Court had in July last year directed that the 15 rebel MLAs of the Congress and JD(S) ought not to be compelled to take part in the proceedings of the Karnataka Assembly, which was then slated to decide the confidence motion moved by the H D Kumaraswamy-led state government.  Soon after the governor wrapped up his address to the Assembly earlier on Monday, Singh said, \"You all know that in the wake of (Covid-19) pandemic outbreak, the ongoing Assembly sessions of Rajasthan, Kerala, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Maharasthra have been adjourned.\"  BJP chief whip in the Assembly Narottam Mishra said Kamal Nath should seek a trust vote on Monday itself as directed by the governor. There were noisy scenes after Congress legislators objected to the demand.  Prajapati spoke to the governor who asked the members to \"uphold democratic values and pride\" of the state.  Leader of Opposition Gopal Bhargava said trust vote should be held, to which Prajapati said the opposition hasn't held any talk with the Speaker over the issue.  The treasury and opposition benches traded charges and amid the commotion, the Speaker left the House for a while.  When he returned, the opposition pressed for the trust vote vociferously, while the treasury benches opposed them.  Amid the noisy scenes, Singh drew the attention of the Speaker to the coronavirus situation which he said has assumed alarming global proportions.  The Speaker then adjourned the House till March 26.  The drama didn't stop after the House was adjourned, as 106 MLAs of the BJP, led by Chouhan reached the governor's residence and demanded that a floor test be held immediately.  Meanwhile, Nath dared the BJP to bring a no-confidence motion against his government.  \"If the BJP is demanding floor test and saying that we don't have majority, they should bring a no-confidence motion against my government. Why are they shying away (from brining a no-confidence motion). We will prove our majority,\" Nath told reporters.  Earlier in the day, BJP MLAs reached the Assembly in three separate buses along with senior party leaders, after arriving in Bhopal from Manesar in Haryana at around 2 am.  Many legislators were seen covering their faces with masks amid the threat of coronavirus. These masks were provided by the state Assembly secretariat.  Talking to reporters after meeting the governor, Chouhan said, \"Kamal Nath government is in a minority. This government has lost its majority. The governor had directed the chief minister to prove his majority in the floor test on March 16. They should not have had any problem in facing the floor test, if they have majority\".  Nath on Monday wrote to Tandon stating that holding of a floor test in the Assembly would have been \"undemocratic and unconstitutional\" in view of some MLAs of the Congress being held in \"captivity\" by the BJP with the help of the Karnataka Police.  \"I would like you to recall that when I met you on March 13, 2020, I had brought to your notice that the BJP has kept many Congress MLAs as captive under the control of Karnataka Police and they were forced to give different types of statements.  \"I have clarified that in such a situation holding any floor test has no meaning and it will be undemocratic and unconstitutional,\" Nath stated in his six-page letter.  Chouhan said Nath has no constitutional right to run the government after losing majority, in view of 22 Congress MLAs tendering their resignation from the House.  \"The number of Congress MLAs in the House has reduced to 92 (after resignation of 22 MLAs). We have 106 MLAs who have come to Raj Bhawan. The BJP has a clear majority now. The Congress government is evading the floor test,\" he said.  The Speaker had accepted the resignation of six of the 22 Congress MLAs.  To a query on the Assembly being adjourned over the coronavirus concern cited by the state government, Chouhan said, \"Even coronavirus cannot save this unstable government\".

Informed sources told Dawn that during an in-camera meeting of the committee, headed by National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser, members belonging to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) and Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) unanimously rejected the idea of establishing the volunteers’ force, alleging that the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) was politicising ongoing national efforts to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.  According to the sources, the committee members witnessed a brief heated exchange of arguments between PML-N’s Mushahidullah Khan and Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi when the latter defended Prime Minister Imran Khan’s decision to establish the Tiger Force, claiming that the youth from any political party could join it.  Pointing towards Adviser to the PM on Finance Dr Abdul Hafeez Shaikh and Adviser on Commerce Abdul Razzak Dawood, who were participating in the meeting through the video links, Mushahidullah Khan objected that the two men were non-elected and they had been given the most important portfolios.  Similarly, the sources said, the PML-N senator pointed out that Special Assistant to the PM on Health Dr Zafar Mirza and head of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Lt Gen Mohammad Afzal, the two key personalities leading the nation’s war against Covid-19, were also non-elected.  PML-N says technocrats should not be allowed to formulate policies  He was of the view that technocrats should not be allowed to formulate policies as they were not directly answerable to the people.  The PML-N senator also criticised the government for closing all dispensaries, medical stores and OPDs of hospitals across the country, as this government step was causing problems for the masses. He said even the Chief Justice of Pakistan had made adverse remarks over the issue when he had to face difficulties in getting the treatment of his wife due to closure of the dispensary.  He alleged that there was a lack of coordination between the Centre and provinces.  The parliamentary committee meeting took place only a day after the prime minister made an appeal to the country’s youth to get themselves registered with the Coronavirus Relief Tiger Force (CRTF) to help the poor and daily-wage earners and provide them food and medical assistance. The prime minister had also disclosed that already 750,000 volunteers had got themselves registered with the CRTF.  Parliamentary leader of the PML-N in the National Assembly Khawaja Asif said it was an inappropriate act of the government to use official resources for the publicity of the PTI through printing of party flags, banners and shirts during relief activities in the fight against Covid-19.  “Do not use official resources for the promotion of a particular political party,” he said.  “There is a need for national unity on a national crisis. Don’t divide the nation on different grounds as this is not the time to do politics,” the PML-N leader said, adding: “The use of Tiger Force is nothing but politics. It is against the national spirit to fight Covid-19 jointly.”  Khawaja Asif also condemned the use of police force against protesting young doctors in Balochistan and expressed concern over shifting of coronavirus-affected people from quarantines to provinces.  He alleged that the federal government was itself responsible for the spread of coronavirus in the country as 50 per cent of the people tested positive had been sent to provinces by it.  Meanwhile, according to an official handout, the parliamentary committee approved 12 terms of references (ToR) prepared by a sub-committee, headed by Minister for Narcotics Control Azam Swati.  The opposition members raised a number of questions about non-availability of ventilators, testing kits and other equipment required for treating coronavirus patients, utilisation of funds and distribution of relief items.  Foreign Minister Qureshi said the main objective of the committee was to collect inputs from political leaders and send them to the National Command and Control Centre and the National Coordination Committee for taking further inputs and decisions and for implementation.  He said the role of the parliamentary committee would be oversight of the activities of the government relating to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Mr Qureshi said that food items would be distributed to 12 million people as per old data and four million people as per new data and prescribed procedure was being finalised for distribution of food, protective gear and testing kits and all data would be available on the website.  The next meeting of the committee will be held on April 20.

Rand Paul, R-Ky., said Sunday that he had tested positive for the disease caused by the new coronavirus, becoming the first member of the Senate to report a case of COVID-19. He said in a tweet that he was feeling fine and was in quarantine.  Paul, a doctor, said he has not had symptoms and was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events. He said he was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person.  Paul, a deficit hawk, was among eight Senate Republicans who voted against a House-passed bill last week that provided more than $100 billion to boost testing for the coronavirus and guarantee paid sick leave for millions of workers. He also was only Republican senator who opposed an earlier bill authorizing $8.3 billion for initial response to the coronavirus.  The senator was on Capitol Hill on Wednesday afternoon, which was the last time the Senate held floor votes, including on one of his amendments. While Senate Republicans have lunched together as a group most days since, it is unclear if Paul was among them.  Two House members, Reps. Mario Diaz Balart, R-Fla., and Ben McAdams, D-Utah,, have tested positive.  The Senate was in session Sunday seeking a bipartisan response to the pandemic. If approved, the bill would be the third measure Congress has approved in response to the coronavirus this month.  The White House has increasingly emphasized that testing should prioritize the elderly and health care workers who have symptoms of the virus. While most cases of COVID-19 are mild and tens of thousands of people have recovered, older people and those with underlying health problems are at higher risk for more serious problems, such as pneumonia.  “We don’t want everyone to go out and get a test because there’s no reason for it,” President Donald Trump told reporters in a briefing Friday.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells people to seek testing if they have certain symptoms of the flu-like illness caused by the coronavirus – fever, cough and trouble breathing – and if they have traveled recently to an outbreak area or have been in close contact with someone who is infected. They should first be tested for the flu and other routine infections.  The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.

The state imposed a 'stay at home' order from midnight on 30 March until midnight on 13 April, with a few exceptions such as shopping or exercising.  One resident asked on Twitter if she was allowed to visit her partner at his home.  Police Minister Lisa Neville replied: 'You cannot visit your partner for social reasons.'  Asked if a social visit was allowed, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said in a press conference: 'That's not work, that's not care-giving, that's not medical care, that's not shopping for the things you need when you need them, and it does not comply with the rules. People should not do that.'  The strict rule also means that single people who connect on dating apps have no way to meet each other.  The Victorian government website reads: 'Every interaction with another person carries the risk of transmission and should be avoided.'  Victoria has 968 cases of coronavirus with 32 people in hospital and six in intensive care  But the Premier backflipped on the decision on Wednesday night after it sparked widespread criticism throughout the day.  Just before 5pm Victorian Chief Health Officer Professor Brett Sutton said an exemption would be made for couples living apart.

(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio)  In the decade before Michigan and its largest city became the latest hot spot for the deadly coronavirus, officials were steadily, and at times dramatically, cutting back on their first line of defense against pandemics and other public health emergencies.  Approaching bankruptcy, Detroit disbanded most of its public health department and handed its responsibilities to a private nonprofit. When the department reopened in 2014 in the back of the municipal parking office, its per capita budget was a fraction of other big cities', to serve a needier population.  In Ingham County, home to the capital city of Lansing, then-Public Health Director Renee Branch Canady sat down at budget time for seven straight years to figure out what more to cut.  \"It was just chop, chop, chop,\" Canady said. By the time she left in 2014, all the health educators, who teach people how to prevent disease, were gone.  [CORONAVIRUS: Click here for our complete coverage » arkansasonline.com/coronavirus]  What happened in Michigan also played out across the country and at the federal level after the 2008 recession, which caused serious budget problems for governments. But as the economy recovered, public health funding did not, a review of budget figures and interviews with health experts and officials shows.  A shortfall persisted despite several alarming outbreaks, from H1N1 to Ebola, and has left the U.S. more vulnerable now to covid-19, experts say. In normal times, public health workers are in the community, immunizing children, checking on newborns and performing other tasks. In a health emergency, they're tracing outbreaks, conducting testing and serving as first responders when people fall sick -- efforts that are lagging in many states as the coronavirus spreads.  \"Our funding decisions tied their hands,\" said Brian Castrucci, who worked with health departments in Philadelphia, Texas and Georgia and is now president of the de Beaumont Foundation, a health advocacy organization.  The cuts came under both Democratic and Republican administrations. While there is no single number that reflects all federal, state and local spending, the budget for the federal Centers for Disease Control, the core agency for public health, fell by 10% between fiscal 2010 and 2019 after adjusting for inflation, according to an analysis by the Trust for America's Health, a public health research and advocacy organization.  The group found that federal funding to help state and local officials prepare for emergencies such as the coronavirus outbreak has also fallen -- from about $1 billion after 9/11 to less than $650 million last year.  Between 2008 and 2017, state and local health departments lost more than 55,000 jobs -- one-fifth of their workforce, a major factor as cities struggle to respond to covid-19.  \"It definitely has made a difference,\" said John Auerbach, Trust for America's Health CEO and a former public health director in Massachusetts.  New York has seen the most covid-19 cases in the U.S., but numbers are surging in places such as Detroit, where those testing positive nearly tripled in the week between March 28 and Saturday, when officials said the city was approaching 4,000 cases, with 129 deaths. A more robust health system could have done more earlier to track down and isolate people who were exposed, said the city's former health director, Abdul El-Sayed.  State spending on public health in Michigan dropped 16% from an inflation-adjusted high point of $300 million in 2004, according to a 2018 study.  Some of the funding problems, Canady and other public health advocates believe, stem from a fundamental belief in smaller government among Republican governors, including former Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, who called for \"shared sacrifice\" after the state's auto-dependent economy was battered by the recession.  In Kansas, then-Gov. Sam Brownback ran what he called a \"red-state experiment\" to cut taxes. State spending on its Public Health Division, outside of federal funds, dropped 28% between 2008 and 2016.  The cuts meant a \"shifting of responsibility for services from the state level to the county level,\" Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly said. \"And we saw that in public health.\"  In Maine, then-Gov. Paul Le Page's administration stopped replacing public health nurses who were dealing with families in the opioid crisis. The number of nurses fell from about 60 to the low 20s before the Legislature tried to reverse the action.  Although agencies often receive emergency funding when a crisis strikes, the infusion is temporary.  \"Decisions are made politically to support something when it becomes an epidemic,\" said Derrick Neal, a public health official in Abilene when Ebola surfaced in Texas. \"And then as time passes, the funding shrinks.\"  In Oklahoma, state funding for the Department of Health still hasn't returned to its levels of 2014, when a combination of slumping oil prices, tax cuts and corporate breaks punched a giant hole in the state's budget. When state revenue later improved, the money went to other priorities.  \"It's much easier to cut funding for public health than it is to start taking away benefits from people or access to care for people,\" said former state Rep. Doug Cox, an emergency room doctor.  Castrucci said the problem with providing more money only at times of emergency is that it doesn't allow time to recruit and train new workers.  \"We waited until the house was on fire before we started interviewing firefighters,\" he said.

Every effort to contain the virus has failed, cases have started to pop up all over America, and the latest numbers show that it is 34 times more deadly than the flu. And what makes this particular coronavirus even more frightening is the fact that it is so easy to catch. You can become infected simply by breathing in the air around you, it can live on solid surfaces for days, and some victims can carry it around for weeks before ever showing any symptoms. As this virus continues to spread, literally no public place will be safe, and that is really freaking a lot of people out.  But so far only 12 Americans have died from the virus.  If thousands start dying in this country, what is our national mood going to be like at that point?  Already, the level of stress that we are witnessing is very alarming. The following comes from an NPR article about the “national anxiety” that we are currently experiencing…  And, as the coronavirus spreads, our unanswered questions can make us feel vulnerable or fearful. “Will it come to my community” or “Am I at risk?’ “We’ve got national anxiety at the moment, a kind of shared stress, and we are all in a state of extreme uncertainty,” says Catherine Belling, an associate professor at Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine, who studies the role of fear and anxiety in health care.  Of course there are very good reasons to be concerned about this virus.  More than 3,000 people have already died around the world, and the horrors that we have seen elsewhere on the globe are starting to happen here.  And with each startling headline, the level of anxiety is going to go higher.  All of a sudden, large numbers of Americans are extremely afraid to touch each other or anything around them. The following comes from a Washington Post article entitled “Coronavirus anxiety is everywhere, and there is no cure”…  America this week began to consider the existential threat of a doorknob. The horror of a touch-screen in the self-checkout lane. The inescapable doom that accompanies any trip on public transportation. The realization of how much, exactly, we all touch our faces each day: constantly. Last week, you pressed elevator buttons with abandon. You weren’t afraid of the free weights in the gym. You washed your hands for barely enough time to say “Happy Birthday” once, let alone sing it twice.  This outbreak has already radically altered the behavior of millions of Americans, and we are probably still only in the very early chapters.  Fear of this virus is also causing many of us to stockpile supplies like crazy. Just check out the following numbers from Nielsen…  Fears about a worsening coronavirus outbreak have led shoppers in the U.S. and other hard-hit countries to begin stocking up on supplies to fill “pandemic pantries,” a new report from Nielsen suggests. Sales of sought-after hand sanitizers have risen 73% in dollar value in the four weeks ending Feb. 22, compared with the same period in 2019, Nielsen says. Similarly, medical masks sales spiked 319%, aerosol disinfectants rose 47% and thermometers increased 32%.  If this outbreak continues to intensify, it is inevitable that shortages will begin to emerge.  So if there is something that you need to purchase, you should go get it as soon as you can.  Each new day brings more shocking revelations. On Wednesday, we found out that the number of confirmed cases in New York has risen to 11…  Another family in New York has been confirmed to have the coronavirus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo tweeted this afternoon. The family from New Rochelle is believed to have been in contact with the 50-year old attorney, who has since been hospitalized. The attorney and his family were confirmed to have the virus earlier today. This brings the total number of confirmed cases in New York to 11.  Sadly, Governor Cuomo is expecting many more cases to pop up, and he told the press that trying to contain this virus “is literally like trying to stop air”…  “This is literally like trying to stop air, because somebody sneezes, it’s respiratory and it’s inevitable that it will continue to spread,” Cuomo told reporters Wednesday afternoon. Earlier in the day, Cuomo said there “were going to be many, many people who test positive.”  On the other coast, six new cases were just confirmed in Los Angeles…  As the U.S. death toll hit 11 Wednesday, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and county officials declared states of emergency and announced six additional cases of the deadly coronavirus that has health officials around the world scrambling for answers. More than 130 cases have been confirmed across the nation. Los Angeles had confirmed just one before Wednesday’s announcement.  Alarmingly, one of the newly confirmed cases was a medical screener at LAX…  A medical professional who conducted passenger screenings at Los Angeles International Airport tested positive for the coronavirus late Tuesday, according to the Department of Homeland Security and an internal email obtained by NBC News. The person last worked screening air travelers for illness on Feb. 21, DHS said in a statement, which also said the medical professional had worn the proper protective gear while working. The internal email described the person as a “contract medical screener” for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Just like we have seen in China, medical professionals in the western world are catching COVID-19 despite attempting to take proper precautions.  That just underscores how easily this virus passes from person to person.  As this outbreak continues to intensify, it is probably inevitable that some pretty extreme measures will be taken to get it under control.  In fact, we are already seeing college basketball games get canceled…  Chicago State became the first Division I men’s basketball program to cancel games due to the coronavirus outbreak, announcing on Tuesday the decision not to travel to Seattle University on Thursday or Utah Valley on Saturday. The University of Missouri-Kansas City declared Wednesday the Roos men’s team would not travel to Seattle for its Saturday contest against the Redhawks.  And over in Italy it was just announced that all schools will be closed until mid-March…  Italy announced Wednesday it will temporarily close all its schools and universities as the country continues to grapple with a surge in coronavirus infections, according to new reports. Those closures will begin Thursday and last until mid-March, CNBC reported.  Can you imagine if that happened in the United States?  Of course the kids would love it, and considering the overall quality of the education in our public schools they wouldn’t miss much anyway.  Even before this outbreak started, we were living at a time of great uncertainty, and this virus has certainly taken things to an entirely new level.  We still don’t know if this will become a true global pandemic that will kill millions of people, but many prominent voices are acknowledging that it is definitely a possibility. The following comes from Piers Morgan…  Should it become a global pandemic, as many experts now fear, then the consequences could be devastating. In 1918, the H1N1 ‘Spanish flu’ virus killed between 50-100 million people. Tech titan Bill Gates, who spends much of his time and money combatting diseases with his charitable foundation, said: ‘In the past week, coronavirus has started behaving a lot like the once-in-a-century pathogen we’ve been worried about.’  If COVID-19 does kill millions of people, it will cause fear on a scale that most of us would not even want to imagine right now.  Thanks to social media, information can spread across the globe in a matter of minutes. There is no way that global authorities will be able to keep the general public calm if things get bad enough, and health systems in the western world will be absolutely overwhelmed as multitudes of sick people swamp the hospitals.  Let us pray that such a scenario does not materialize.  But for now the numbers continue to grow at a frightening rate each day, and “coronavirus anxiety” is going to continue to grow right along with those numbers.

Reduced service levels, limited seating and enhanced cleaning protocols will still be in place, several transit agencies said, acknowledging that even more steps may come into play over time but declining to offer details.  “COVID has changed everything for us,” said Anne Marie Aikins, spokesman for Ontario regional transit provider Metrolinx that operates the heavily travelled GO Transit network. “That’s not going to disappear overnight.”  Aikins said most of the more than 40 pandemic-related measures implemented since the beginning of the year will remain in effect.

The decline meant Go was forced to scale back its services to 50 per cent of typical capacity, but Aikins said Metrolinx tailored remaining routes to align with hospital shift changes, grocery store hours and other scheduling constraints in play for the essential workers still making a daily commute.  The disparity between ridership and service levels, she said, means Go Transit has room to adjust to the gradual increase of traffic expected when Ontario’s economy begins to reopen in the coming weeks.  Similar conversations are taking place at the Toronto Transit Commission, according to spokesman Stuart Green.  The transit provider, which temporarily laid off 1,200 employees amid an 85 per cent drop in ridership, is still running between 70 to 80 per cent of its usual routes in a bid to accommodate essential workers and those reliant on public transit for crucial errands and medical visits.  Green said those workers will start gradually returning as passengers find their way back onto public transit, but said several challenges remain as the TTC tries to find ways of maintaining both operations and public safety.  “It’s very much a balancing act,” Green said. “It’s one of continuing to provide service for people who need it now and being able to accommodate people as they start coming back assuming that there may be certain requirements around physical distancing that we’ll have to keep in mind.”  Some of those requirements were spelled out in guidelines released earlier this week by Ontario’s Health and Safety Association. The recommendations pertaining to transit employers have already been largely implemented at Metrolinx and the TTC, according to their respective spokespeople.  Ottawa’s transit provider, OCTranspo, issued a statement saying it would be guided by industry best practices.  “OCTranspo will be ready to adapt the way we provide transit services to meet customer demand and will consult with public health officials as recovery plans evolve in order to provide a safe environment for our customers and employees,”  Transit Customer Systems and Planning Director Pat Scrimgeour said without providing further details.  Similar approaches are unfolding in parts of the country whose return to pre-pandemic norms seems more imminent.  Demands on local transit systems will likely increase in Alberta beginning as early as Monday when most health services in the province are allowed to resume. Retailers and personal services will be allowed to start opening their doors 10 days later on May 14.  In Winnipeg, where some businesses will reopen effective Monday, City Emergency Operation Centre Manager Jay Shaw said buses will continue to run on a reduced schedule, adding more vehicles if physical distancing is becoming too difficult to enforce with existing resources.  Such concerns are on the minds of transit employees, according to the union representing TTC workers.  Carlos Santos, President of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 113, praised efforts to equip workers with protective equipment, redistribute seating and reconfigure vehicle boarding protocols in a bid to keep staff safe.  But he said more proactive steps will be needed to ensure employee health as transit operations gradually ramp up.  “I think what they’re going to have to start doing is putting in markers at stations and putting markers on platforms … just like they have in other cities in the world that have started to reopen,” Santos said.

According to a statement by Virginia’s Community Colleges Chancellor Glenn DuBois, the system is instituting a \"pass/no-pass policy\" that allows individual students to ask their professors for their letter grades if they so choose.  DuBois said he made the decision after speaking with the presidents of all the community colleges in Virginia and hearing from faculty members and students.  He said the move would help students avoid being disadvantaged on their transcripts due to global pandemic out of their control, as some students face new challenges in having courses moved online and others may face the coronavirus itself or face its effect on a family member or eve an instructore.  DuBois said the new policy allows more flexibility to handle all of those situations.  They've also extended the date by which students can withdraw from courses to the end of the semester as well.  \"We have come to understand that these grades will not disadvantage any student seeking to transfer to a public university in Virginia and we know that it will not hamper one’s progress in their community college pursuit, or affect one’s financial aid eligibility,\" DuBois said.  The new policy only applies to spring 2020 courses that have not finished by April 6 — It doesn't apply to spring courses that are already done or any future semester courses.  Each of the 23 colleges in the system can choose exactly how they implement the policy, so students are recommended to direct any questions to their college, starting with their instructors.  The Virginia Community Colleges system previously called off all May commencement ceremonies as well, in response to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines that recommend people avoid gatherings of 50 people or more for the next 8 weeks.

The Daily Mail reports that the antibody, “known as 47D11, targets the deadly virus’s infamous ‘spike protein’, which it uses to hook onto cells and insert its genetic material.”  Researchers say that the virus, depicted as a sphere with spikes, “binds to this protein and prevents it from hooking on – effectively neutralising it.”  The good news is that the antibody attacks the worst part of the virus that creates the respiratory disease in COVID-19.  The Daily Mail says the breakthrough could “alter the course of infection or protect an unfenced person exposed to someone with the virus.”  The European research team identified the antibody from 51 cell lines from mice that had been engineered to carry human genes. The antibody targets the novel coronavirus that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-1. However, scientists claim that it can also neutralise SARS-CoV-2, which is from the same family of coronaviruses as SARS-CoV-1. ‘This research builds on the work our groups have done in the past on antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV that emerged in 2002/2003,’ said co-lead author Professor Berend-Jan Bosch at Utrecht University. ‘Using this collection of SARS-CoV antibodies, we identified an antibody that also neutralises infection of SARS-CoV-2 in cultured cells. The virus hooks onto a locking point on human cells to insert its genetic material, makes multiples copies of itself and spreads throughout the body.  Researchers say not only will the antibody neutralize the virus, but it can be made in the lab, which means it’s not dependent on plasma from people previously infected with the virus.  ‘Antibodies like this can be made in the lab instead of purified from people’s blood and could conceivably be used as a treatment for disease, but this has not yet been demonstrated.  We can only hope that this is a genuine breakthrough. Research scientists say that this will not be without risk because injecting people with antibodies can be dangerous.

The Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS), introduced in April 2015, is imposed on anyone in the UK on a work, study or family visa for longer than six months in order to raise additional funds for the NHS.  In the Budget earlier this month, Indian-origin UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced that the charge would be further hiked from 400 pounds to 624 pounds per year.  We believe that this surcharge is discriminatory and unfair, as the overseas workers are already paying their due share of National Insurance contributions, superannuation and income tax, reads the letter sent to Johnson on Wednesday by the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO), which has been lobbying against the IHS for many years.  We request you to remove the health surcharge with immediate effect. The NHS has been in a workforce crisis for several years, but now with the COVID-19 pandemic, there has never been a worse time for an overstrained service, and we require all the help we can get to meet the challenges, appeals the letter, signed by BAPIO President Ramesh Mehta, chair J S Bamrah and Secretary Professor Parag Singhal.  They believe that the health surcharge not only adds a significant financial burden on new arrivals but also makes them feel \"undervalued\", and it proves a disincentive to BAPIO's recruitment drives from India.  By removing this, the government will demonstrate the genuineness of their caring attitude towards frontline staff, the letter notes.  It comes just as thousands of retired Indian-origin doctors and nurses began answering the UK government's call to return to the NHS as the health service comes under considerable strain, with over 9,500 positive cases of COVID-19 and the country's death toll from the deadly virus rising to 465.  These are exceptional and extraordinary times and we are here to assist the health service as much as possible. We are advising our recently retired doctors to return to work, of course with the provision that if any of them are unwell or have a chronic illness they must follow the government advice and self isolate, said Mehta.  The UK has an estimated 60,000 doctors of Indian-origin working within the NHS, often referred to as the backbone of the country's health service.  Among the recently retired, at least a couple of thousand are likely to be of Indian-origin, with a further estimated 10,000 in long-term retirement who are also being rallied to assist in whatever capacity possible.  During his weekly briefing from 10 Downing Street on Wednesday evening, Johnson issued a special thank you to these returning medics and the nearly 405,000 people who have volunteered to support the NHS.  To all of you, and all the former NHS staff who are coming back now into the service, I say thank you on behalf of the entire country,\" he said.  The effort was also lauded by MPs in the House of Commons before Parliament closed its session on Wednesday, earlier than planned for its Easter break to comply with the strict social distancing rules amid a near-lockdown and stay at home government order in an effort to try and control the rapid spread of the pandemic.

He was a family man, a great businessman, and a tireless advocate for Jersey City throughout his nearly 3 decades of public service,” Fulop said in a statement.  “More than that though, he was a great husband, father, and grandfather as he never missed a chance to share how proud he was of his family. This is devastating for all of us here, as Michael was part of our Jersey City family. We will miss him and we will continue to aggressively fight against this pandemic, now in his honor.â€  Yun, 65, had battled the virus for nearly two weeks at the Jersey City Medical Center, where he was a patient at the ICU at was “on oxygen” as of at least March 29th.  He was first elected to his post in 2013 and re-elected in 2017. He won both of those races running as an independent.  Ward C Councilman Rich Boggiano, who said he’d known Yun for 46 years, was expectedly stunned by his passing.  â€œI lost a good friend. Iâ€™ve known him for 46 years and Iâ€™m heartbroken. I donâ€™t know what else to say â€¦ I feel sorry for his wife because sheâ€™s such a great person. Iâ€™m gonna miss him a lot.â€  Another council colleague, Ward A’s Denise Ridley, also shared her feelings with HCV.  â€œMichael was definitely a family man and an asset to this city, a large put of this city is missing due to his passing. A great man and weâ€™re definitely gonna miss him.â€  Additionally, Jersey City Councilman-at-Large Rolando Lavarro tested positive for the virus last month, but more recently has been on the mend at home.  “I couldâ€™ve been in the same place where Michael is. I pray for his wife and his family. A huge loss for Jersey City, the council lost a great person. We may not have agreed on everything, but he was a great person,” he said.  Board of Chosen Freeholders Chair Anthony Vainieri (D-8) mourned Yun’s passing as well.  “Councilman Michael Yun was a tremendous advocate for his neighborhood, for the local small business community and for all of Jersey City,” he said.  “I was honored to call Councilman Yun a friend and had the opportunity to represent a small section of his Ward in my Freeholder district, and I always found him to be a dedicated, hardworking public servant. My heart goes out to his family, his staff, friends and constituents during this tragic time.”  During his daily press conference in Trenton, Gov. Phil Murphy (D) also paid tribute to Yun.  â€œLiterally, just moments ago, I learned about the passing of a good friend: Jersey City Councilman Michael Yun. I had literally exchanged notes with Michael probably not more than a week ago … He was a respected leader not just in Jersey City but in Hudson County,” he stated.  “A good man, a great professional, a terrific husband, a father, grandfather: we stand with Jersey City and Hudson County in mourning his loss. We send our deepest prayers and thoughts to his family: an outstanding public servant and a really, really good guy.â€  After news of his passing, residents began placing candles and hanging signs outside of the headquarters of his civic association on Central Avenue, which used to be his general store, Garden State News, until 2015.  Pedestrians walked by, some in disbelief of the news, and drivers passed by, honking and yelling from their windows: “Terrible, he was a great guy,” one man said.  “He was a personal friend of mine, I’ve known him for 30 years,” said Erik-Anders Nilsson, a Heights resident who held back tears as he discussed the late councilman. “He was one of the first people when I first moved here.”  “He was wonderful to me, to the community … He would have parties here for seniors, kids; he’d always give out Christmas presents here.”  Yun was an active advocate in the Heights community, as well as the city at-large.  He was active with the Jersey City Peace Movement, which aimed to distribute cloths and supplies to the city’s homeless population was also active with another community organization called Action 21.  “He would get brand new hats, scarves, gloves, toiletries: tons of stuff,” Nilsson said. “And the boxes would cover the sidewalk. We’d bring it to Journal Square and Central Avenue and hand them out.”  His wife, Jennifer, remains in self-quarantine.  Yun is the second Hudson County elected official to pass away from the coronavirus.  Weehawken Finance Director and Board of Education President Richard Barsa died on Saturday morning.  Hudson County Clerk E. Junior Maldonado and Assemblywoman Angelica Jimenez (D-32) have also been recently diagnosed with COVID-19.

(KTXL) — Several weeks into school districts across the state implementing distance learning protocols, some students are still struggling to get what they need to get the work done.  Starting this week, 70,000 laptops, Chromebooks and tablets will be distributed to students as a result of what Governor Gavin Newsom and first partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom describe as a two-week sprint to call on state businesses and philanthropists to donate the resources because of the need created by COVID-19.  Siebel Newsom led the effort and on Monday revealed that a statewide survey shows one in five California children lack connectivity or an appropriate device for distance learning.  Fifty percent of low-income families and 42% of families of color are worried about schooling at home because they do not have a personal device at home.  “We all know that education is fundamental to opportunity and so our mission will not end until every child in California has what they need to continue learning while physically distanced,” Siebel Newsom said. “This pandemic should not stand in the way of California students reaching their potential and realizing their dreams.”  The California Public Utility Commission is also getting in on this effort with a $30 million teleconnection initiative to get students Wi-Fi- hot spots. It builds on an initiative from Google helping the state add 100,000 hot spots for students.

The quarter spanned the beginning of stay-at-home orders in the U.S. and around the world, a response to the coronavirus pandemic that apparently led millions to latch onto Netflix for entertainment and comfort when most had nowhere to be but home.  Netflix more than doubled the quarterly growth it predicted in January, well before the COVID-19 outbreak began to shut down many major economies. It was the biggest three-month gain in the 13-year history of Netflix's streaming service.  The numbers — released Tuesday as part of Netflix’s first-quarter earnings report — support a growing belief that video streaming is likely to thrive even as the overall U.S. economy sinks into its first recession in more than a decade.  “Our small contribution to these difficult times is to make home confinement a little more bearable,\" Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said while speaking to investors during a video call from a bedroom.  Investor optimism about Netflix’s prospects propelled the company’s stock to new highs recently, a sharp contrast with the decline in the broader market.  Netflix's shares initially surged in after-hours trading after the first-quarter report came out, although they soon fell back. One reason: The strengthening U.S. dollar will likely depress the company's revenue from outside the U.S., which could dampen gains from some of its fastest growing markets.  Currency effects also limited Netflix revenue growth to 17%, for a total of $5.8 billion, even though the company ended March with nearly 183 million worldwide subscribers, a 23% increase from the same time last year. Netflix earned $709 million in the first quarter, nearly tripling its profit from last year.  Netflix shares edged up by less than 1% in Tuesday's extended trading to $435.69, leaving them below last week's record high of $449.52.  Even though it faces plenty of competition, Netflix appears better positioned to take advantage of the surging demand for TV shows and movies largely because of its head start in video streaming.  Since beginning its foray into original programming seven years ago, Netflix has built up a deep catalog that can feed viewer appetites even though the pandemic response has shut down production on many new shows.  That stoppage could hurt Netflix as well, although analysts at Canaccord Genuity believe its video library will serve as a \"content moat\" that can keep most competitors at bay.  One notable exception is Walt Disney Co., whose recently launched streaming service is also stocked with perennial classics, especially for children who have even more free time than usual.  That’s one of the big reasons Disney’s service has amassed 50 million subscribers and why Netflix is basking in another resurgence in popularity. Netflix predicted it will add 7.5 million subscribers from April through June. That's nearly three times more than its average springtime gain of 2.7 million subscribers during the past seven years.  Hastings praised Disney's fast start in streaming as \"stunning\" in his video call with investors. \"My hat's off to them,\" he said. \"We are both going to do great work.\"  Most of the most popular programs Netflix has in the works for this year are already completed, including the fourth season of \"The Crown,\" its acclaimed series about Queen Elizabeth's continuing reign in the United Kingdom.  Even so, Hastings warned that subscriber growth seems likely to taper off during the second half of the year, given how many new viewers are poring into the service during the first half. That was just a guess, Hastings said, adding that the only thing he feels certain about these days is that video streaming win more converts for at least the next five years.

Mental health expert Eric Kussin says it's OK to feel depressed over the loss of sports in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak and provides steps you can take to address these emotions. USA TODAY  There have been several watershed moments in sports fanhood scattered across history: sports debuting on television, night games, the advent of ESPN, free agency, the internet, and so forth.  Each had a lasting impact, such that it’s easy to recall what sports consumption was like before and what it was like after. And while the coronavirus has had a similarly profound impact, Daniel Wann does not consider it to be one of those watershed moments.  “Fandom will return to normal,” Wann said.  He would know. Or, given the unprecedented nature of the coronavirus, at least have the best guess. Wann, a Murray State professor who has a Ph.D. in social psychology, has been studying sports fanhood for more than three decades. ESPN dubbed him “Dr. Fandom.”  Whenever live sports return from its current, unparalleled hiatus, there will likely be a dip in attendance due to health concerns, and there could be some casual fans who lose interest. But Wann hypothesizes — he’s quick to note that, with literally no precedent, there are no guarantees — the coronavirus will not be a catalyst for change in the same way as previous moments.  “I don’t really think this is going to be one of those things,” said Wann, who co-wrote \"Sport fans: The psychology and social impact of fandom.\"  Dr. Daniel Wann (Photo: Murray State University)  The KFC Yum Center hasn’t hosted an event since the Lumineers played to a big crowd on March 10, just one day before the sports world began to unfurl. When sports do return, will fans be eager to squash themselves into tightly bound stadium seats or walk through sardine-packed concourses?  A Seton Hall Sports Poll of 762 respondents conducted this month found that 72% would not attend games without the development of a vaccine.  That could be a ways away.  Researchers estimate it will take 12 to 18 months to create and distribute a vaccine. Perhaps even longer. Perhaps not at all.  “It’s hard to anticipate a brand new vaccine coming on board any faster than that,” University of Kentucky epidemiologist Kathleen Winter said, “because we really have to get through many different stages of development before you can even begin production.”  NFL GAMES WITHOUT FANS?: Especially 'devastating' to this city's economy  LAKERS: Teturn $4.6M loan received from Paycheck Protection Program  METS COACH: Trying to keep Curacao fed one meal at a time during pandemic  CORONAVIRUS & SPORTS: Get the latest news and information right in your inbox. Sign up here.  Some foreign sports leagues have returned to play without fans, and that option is being considered in the United States, too.  But part of the fan experience is the act of attending the game or hearing the roar of the crowd, and Wann said that fans will be surprised at how strange they find a televised basketball game played for a crowd of empty seats with nothing but squeaking sneakers as a soundtrack.  “I think that, as a matter of fact, (fans) may find it stranger than no sports at all because it’s going to be a different product,” Wann said.  Two Kentucky football fans sit alone in the stands as the Wildcats were blown out by Georiga in 2018. (Photo: Matt Stone/Courier Journal)  Sports with live audiences will return, though, and when they do, there could be a dip in attendance. Following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the NFL saw a slight and temporary drop in attendance as some considered large gatherings to be potential targets. According to a 2010 study, MLB saw as much as a 12% decrease in attendance during terror alerts in 2002 and 2003. As time passed, though, terror alerts became less of a factor on attendance, and in 2006, the league set an all-time attendance record.  The coronavirus — a different threat, but a safety concern nonetheless — could have a similar impact as 9/11 did on event attendance: notable, but temporary. Wall Street analysts forecast that it will take roughly two years for Disney parks to reach their pre-pandemic attendance levels. Perhaps sports will follow a similar timetable.  Sports fans are fiercely loyal, though, and often unreasonably so: 47% would at least consider donating an organ if it meant a guaranteed championship for their team. So, it’s reasonable to believe the diehards will remain steadfast.  “When fans are given the opportunity to go back, they’re gonna go,” Wann said. “I can’t point to a specific study or data set that says that because, believe it or not, we actually don’t have any research on how fans respond to pandemics because this has never happened before.”  Winter said that, once a vaccine is found or there is enough natural immunity to alleviate concerns, it’s unlikely the public will behave much differently than before.  “Eventually, I don’t think that should be an ongoing fear,” Winter said.  Louisville City FC was slated to play its home opener — the first match at Lynn Family Stadium — on April 11. As the club and its league, the USL Championship, consider a return to play in 2020, LouCity President Brad Estes said that all options remain open, including playing games in front of socially distanced fans.  He doesn’t foresee lower attendance when the venue eventually does open.  “I think fans are going to be chomping at the bit to come to games,” Estes said.  There could be other enduring impacts. Wann wonders how the socialization of sports will be altered. Might children who are without sports during this foundational time period develop a different relationship with sports?   It’s all uncharted territory.  “No one knows, and that includes me,” Wann said.  It is known, of course, that the coronavirus’ impact on sports has been drastic and unprecedented. It’ll be long-lasting, too, in terms of absences and asterisks in the record books. But it may not be the next watershed moment in the consumption of sports; fanhood and fascination with sports will continue.  The coronavirus is creating a drought, but not a defining moment.

But the timing and source of the dog urine research grant -- HHS, one of the most important U.S. government agencies responding to the coronavirus -- underscore that although the U.S. government often must spend large amounts of money to address major problems, there is also a significant amount of government spending that goes to far less urgent priorities, according to Rep.

(CNN) — In ordinary times, music therapy for Michael Russo’s hospice patients revolves around glorified home concerts: the troubadour breaks out the guitar, plays Louis Armstrong’s “What a Wonderful World” or “Crazy” by Willie Nelson and spreads life-affirming joy during a patient’s final days.  But during the coronavirus pandemic, which has prompted hospice facilities to enact strict social distancing policies to minimize the risk of infection, Russo has had to improvise.  Instead of one-on-one sessions in patient rooms, he’s embraced Facebook Live broadcasts, video call sessions and even recorded messages.  During a recent house call to hospice patients at an assisted living facility in Punta Gorda, Florida, Russo set up his one-man band on a patio outside a giant window. He was close enough to the lobby so patients could hear him but safely distanced behind glass so he wouldn’t risk infecting his audience.  “Nurses wheeled patients right up against the window so they could see me and hear me and sing along as they would anywhere else,” he said. “We weren’t completely together, but it was the next best thing.”  This sort of innovation has become commonplace at end-of-life facilities these days.  At a time when the specter of Covid-19 looms ominously over public health systems around the world, Russo and other hospice workers are going above and beyond to create joyful and meaningful moments for patients and their loved ones. Some of these efforts hinge upon technology. Others are all about heart.  Most of the actions constitute simple gestures that typically wouldn’t warrant more than a passing “thank you.” But in the context of a global pandemic, they loom large and have made a huge difference to people in the last stages of life.  “Hospice [and palliative care] professionals are trying to care for people in the best ways they know how,” said Shoshana Ungerleider, a medical doctor in San Francisco and founder of End Well, a nonprofit and annual conference about grief, loss and dying. “The results have been nothing short of inspiring.”   Embracing technology to connect  To be clear, patients end up in hospice at the end of long battles with terminal diseases — not because of Covid-19. The threat of coronavirus has prompted hospice facilities to keep these highly vulnerable patients sequestered. This is where the creativity comes in.  Many hospice workers have relied upon technology to forge connections, facilitating Zoom or FaceTime chats with family members so neither patients nor loved ones feel alone.  Balu Natarajan, chief medical officer at Seasons Hospice & Palliative Care in Rosemont, Illinois, said his company has encouraged its employees to “bend over backward” to make patients feel comfortable and loved in their final moments of life, even if that means acting as liaisons to convey final thoughts or farewell messages over the phone. He noted that Seasons currently has about 6,000 patients spread across facilities in 19 different states.  “For us, hospice is about making sure our patients die comfortably,” said Natarajan, a medical doctor. “So much of what we’re talking about is bereavement, or grief for the living after patients die. A lot of that is simply getting loved ones to make a connection before it’s too late.”  Natarajan recounted the story of a nurse who sat with a patient while she died, then on her own volition called the patient’s daughter to tell the daughter she was with mom until the end.  “In that case, the nurse was able to say, ‘I was with your mom,'” he said. “It makes a huge difference.”  Other healthcare experts shared different experiences. Ungerleider, for example, remembered a Seattle funeral director who received FaceTime lessons from members of a local Jewish community to manage ritualistic bathing practices on the body of a temple congregant after he died.  The funeral director wasn’t Jewish, said Ungerleider, and he had never performed the bathing ritual before.  “Because of social distancing, [the funeral director] was the only one allowed in with the body, and he was determined to go through the ritual because the other congregants could not,” she said. “He didn’t have to do it. He wanted to do it. He wanted to let the man’s family and the committee of volunteers from the temple bury him in peace.”   Care from a distance  In addition to hospice employees using technology to create memorable moments, some have committed to creating magic in person — just far enough from patients and family members to keep the risk of Covid-19 infections low.  In Dillsburg, Pennsylvania, locals recently teamed up with healthcare professionals to create beautiful and heartfelt chalk murals on the sidewalk outside of a senior living complex in town.  Kelly Coons, provider relations manager with hospice company AseraCare, was one of the organizers of the event. She said she went early and marked off 6-foot blocks for each artist, so everyone could stay safely distanced from each other. Some of the children participants drew Easter bunnies and Easter eggs and wrote, “Don’t forget to smile.” Other artists drew hearts and flowers.  “Everyone has to stay in their rooms these days, but that doesn’t mean we can’t bring joy,” said Coons.  About halfway through the drawing session, one of the residents took a black Sharpie and wrote “Thank you” on a pillowcase, then hung it up on the inside of her window.  “As soon as I saw that pillowcase, it made me smile from ear to ear and I definitely teared up,” Coons recounted. “Even in the darkest days of this pandemic, it’s still possible to bring light to someone’s face.”  Elsewhere in the nation, other hospice workers have pulled strategies from a similar playbook. At the 14-room Bradenton Hospice House in Bradenton, Florida, for instance, new rules prohibited patients from receiving the sacrament in their waning days, so Clinical Director Stacy Trudelle and some of her colleagues set out to devise a workaround.  The team recognized that all the rooms have lanais, or covered porches. Then they realized many of the lanais faced the same grassy area. Suddenly, it hit them: A priest could do the blessings from outside.  The first day of the new approach was March 30. That day, nurses wheeled three different patients out to their respective lanais, and a priest gave last rites from the grass, more than 6 feet away. As soon as the priest finished one sacrament, he moved on to the next. Later in the week, after all the patients died, Trudelle said they did so with the comfort that they had received a blessing.  “We pride ourselves on doing whatever we can do for our patients to make their end-of-life [experience] more comfortable,” said Trudelle, who noted that none of the patients had coronavirus. “We’re not on the front lines, but that doesn’t mean we can’t help in other ways.”   New ways of thinking  Even countrywide organizations are getting in on moment-making action. Exhibit A: The National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO) in Alexandria, Virginia. In March, this organization launched the “Faces of Caring” social media campaign to spotlight hospice and palliative care worker members who are making a difference in patients’ lives.  President and CEO Edo Banach says the effort is all about spotlighting the best of humanity.  “We’re letting everybody see the people who are going out there and potentially putting themselves in danger [in the time of coronavirus],” he said.  Hospice workers are desperate to help people nearing the end of their lives.  “It just guts me to hear about all of these poor people dying alone,” Katie Tyrrell Weimann said.  Weimann, 42, is an end-of-life doula, community mental health crisis worker and palliative care social worker from Oak Park, Illinois.  The pandemic represents the intersection of Weimann’s varied interests, and she has vocally and openly put herself out there to help at the front lines.  Earlier this month, Weimann wrote a letter to the administrators at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago offering to act as a “designated family liaison” to sit with patients dying of Covid-19 and navigate goodbyes with loved ones from around the country.

Admiral Mike Gilday said on Thursday that the investigation of the USS Roosevelt matter, which he ordered last week, is now complete and he has started to go through the report.  Gilday, the Navy's chief of operations, said he has not ruled out any options, including possibly reinstating Crozier, if that's where the investigation leads.  'I am taking no options off the table,' he said when asked about Crozier's fate. He said hasn't spoken to Crozier. He said he has gotten no pressure from anyone about the investigation and just wants to make sure his actions are fair.  Admiral Mike Gilday (left) said on Thursday he has not ruled out reinstating USS Theodore Roosevelt captain Brett Crozier (right), who was fired after his memo leaked  The USS Theodore Roosevelt, seen in a file photo, is currently docked in Guam after more than 400 sailors aboard tested positive for coronavirus  The key question, Gilday said, is why Crozier felt compelled to send the memo, and whether it signaled a breakdown in communications with leadership.  The outbreak aboard the Roosevelt began in late March and has thrust the Navy into a leadership crisis. Thomas Modly, who resigned Tuesday as acting Navy secretary, had fired the commander of the Roosevelt, Crozier, for having widely distributed a letter urging faster action by the Navy to save his sailors.  Modly then came under fire for flying out to the Roosevelt last weekend and making remarks to the crew that were harshly critical of Crozier.  Modly's disastrous trip to address sailors aboard the Roosevelt in Guam reportedly cost taxpayers more than $243,000.  The secretary stepped down hours after he returned to Washington, DC, on Tuesday amid outrage over his scathing speech to the sailors, during which he branded Crozier 'naive' and 'stupid' for allegedly sharing his letter outside the chain of command.  On Friday, photos were released showing the Roosevelt's crew members being taken into quarantine, with some being quartered in a hotel and others moving into a high school gymnasium equipped with cots. A skeleton crew remains aboard the ship to maintain its nuclear reactor and fire suppression system.

No details about the sailor, including their gender, age or whether or not they have any underlying health conditions, have been released aside from that they tested positive for COVID-19 on March 30. Since then, they have been in isolation on land.  They were found unresponsive in their room on Thursday morning and have been taken to the Naval Hospital on Guam where they are in intensive care.  Meanwhile, Pentagon leaders anticipate that the coronavirus may strike more Navy ships at sea after an outbreak aboard the Roosevelt infected more than 400 sailors, a top general said Thursday.  Gen. John Hyten, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said one member of the crew of the USS Theodore Roosevelt was hospitalized Thursday in intensive care on Guam, where the carrier has been docked for more than a week. He said 416 crew members are now infected and that 1,164 test results are pending.  'It´s not a good idea to think that the Teddy Roosevelt is a one-of-a-kind issue,' Hyten told a Pentagon news conference. 'We have too many ships at sea. ... To think that it will never happen again is not a good way to plan.'

Modly later apologizes. APRIL 7: Modly resigns APRIL 9: Sailor is found unresponsive. More than 400 sailors from the ship test positive for coronavirus. Advertisement  The Navy´s top officer, meanwhile, said the biggest problem is the inability to test enough people quickly, including those aboard the USS Nimitz, the next U.S.-based aircraft carrier due to deploy out to sea.  'The challenge that we have now, is having that type of capability where we can test in volume and at speed,' Gilday told a small number of reporters Thursday. 'I really don´t have a good estimate right now on when that testing capability might be available in the kinds of quantities we would like to see.'  He said sailors on the USS Nimitz, which is in port preparing for a deployment, will have all movement restricted for two weeks before the ship leaves.  One sailor was taken off the Nimitz more than a week ago after showing symptoms, but the test was not conclusive, the Navy said. Hyten suggested a small number of sailors were ill, but the Navy said Thursday that no sailors currently on the carrier have tested positive for COVID-19 or are showing symptoms.  A retired Navy admiral and former top NATO commander in Europe, James Stavridis, said he sees more trouble ahead, and not just for the Navy.  'Clearly there are more cases to come. The most recent tally on Roosevelt alone is well over 400,' Stavridis said via email. 'The Navy and all the services have some hard choices ahead in terms of whether to pull units off the line to get them well or accept some level of casualties due to the coronavirus. I think it will be a case-by-case approach depending on the mission of the unit.'  Former Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly's disastrous trip to address sailors aboard the coronavirus-stricken USS Roosevelt in Guam reportedly cost taxpayers more than $243,000  Gilday said the Navy has learned from the outbreak on the Roosevelt, including how to move from preventing the virus to containing it when sailors begin showing symptoms.  As of Thursday, 3,190 have tested negative, and results from tests on the rest of the crew are pending. About 2,700 crew members have been taken off the ship and are lodged on the base and in hotels on the island, which is a U.S. territory. Those who have tested positive are being checked by medics twice a day.  More broadly, Hyten said the outbreak aboard the Roosevelt is an illustration that the military has to adapt.  'This will be a new way of doing business that we have to focus in on,' he said, referring to the challenge of recruiting, training, deploying and potentially conducting combat amid the pandemic. 'We´re adjusting to that new world as we speak today.'  Later, in a separate appearance, Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, said that despite the outbreak aboard the Roosevelt, it could be put back to sea and returned to duty relatively quickly if required by world events.  Crozier is seen addressing the crew of the Roosevelt last year. He was removed from his post after his memo leaked, urging the Navy to act faster to deal with the crisis  Crozier is seen above disembarking the ship in Guam for the last time after he was fired over a letter he wrote asking the Navy high command to evacuate the ship due to an outbreak of the coronavirus on board  Speaking along with Hyten at the Pentagon, David Norquist, the deputy secretary of defense, told reporters the defense leaders realize the coronavirus is not going to be a short-term problem in the military.  'We're going to need to change and adapt because even over the coming months, the virus isn't going to go away,' Norquist said. 'We're going to have to be able to operate in a COVID environment.'  For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks.  For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.

Modly had earlier fired the Roosevelt's captain, Brett Crozier, after his worries about the shipboard outbreak and warning that it could dangerously incapacitate much of the crew became public.

What you need to know about the coronavirus  How can I keep from getting sick? The CDC recommends simple preventive steps, including:  Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.  Avoid close contact with people who are sick.  Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.  Stay home when you are sick.  Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.  Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.  What should you do if you think you have coronavirus?  Don't run to the doctor's office – call first!  You should be prepared to answer questions about your symptoms and your risk of exposure to the virus. This is called telephone triage, as the questioner assesses the urgency of your situation. Large health systems and hospitals have scripts for their staff to follow, listing the questions they should ask.  “Anyone who calls in with symptoms of upper respiratory infection, we ask: ‘Do you have fever, chills, and have you traveled?’ ” said Dr. Kennedy Ganti, a primary care physician in Willingboro and a board member of the Medical Society of New Jersey.  How should I treat my illness?  Stay at home and rest.  Avoid close contact with people in your house so you won't make them sick.  Drink plenty of water and other clear liquids to prevent dehydration.  Treat fever and cough with medicines you can buy at the store.  Seek prompt medical attention if your illness is worsening (e.g., difficulty breathing).  For a list of coronavirus-related stories, please click here.

About nine million more people are breathing dirty air than in last year's report.  California once again had the nation's most polluted cities.  A layer of smog covers downtown Los Angeles on August 14, 2019. Los Angeles was the USA's smoggiest city again, according to the new \"State of the Air\" report from the American Lung Association. (Photo: Etienne Laurent, EPA-EFE)  Nearly half of the nation’s population – about 150 million people – live with and breathe polluted air, \"placing their health and lives at risk,\" according to a new report released Tuesday by the American Lung Association, a public health group.  The association's 21st annual “State of the Air” report said climate change continues to make air pollution worse, with many Western cities again seeing record-breaking spikes in particle pollution from wildfires.  “The report finds the air quality in some communities has improved, but the ‘State of the Air’ finds that far too many people are still breathing unhealthy air,” said American Lung Association president and CEO Harold Wimmer.  In fact, about 9 million more people are breathing dirty air than in last year's report.  The 2020 report covers the years 2016-18, so any pollution decreases this year due to the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown were not included.  According to the lung association, those are the three years with the most recent quality-assured air pollution data. In addition, those three years – 2016, 2017 and 2018 – were among the five hottest recorded in global history. When it comes to air quality, changing climate patterns fuel wildfires and their dangerous smoke, and lead to worsened particle and ozone pollution, the report said.  According to the report, unhealthy levels of air pollution places people at risk for premature death and other serious health effects such as lung cancer, asthma attacks, cardiovascular damage and developmental and reproductive harm.  \"Air pollution is linked to greater risk of lung infection,” Wimmer said. “Protecting everyone from COVID-19 and other lung infections is an urgent reminder of the importance of clean air.\"  The report deals with the two main types of air pollution that plague the USA: smog (also known as ground-level ozone) and soot (technically known as \"particulate matter\").  Smog forms on warm, sunny days and is made worse by chemicals that exit vehicle tailpipes and power plant and industrial smokestacks. Warmer temperatures make ozone more likely to form.  Soot pollution is deadlier and more of a health hazard than smog, causing more premature deaths and lung cancer, the lung association said.  Megadrought emerging in the West: Might be worse than any in 1,200 years  Global warming: 2020 expected to be Earth's warmest year on record, scientists say  Primarily because of its geography and weather, California once again had the nation's most polluted cities. Los Angeles and Visalia topped the list for smog; Bakersfield and Fresno led the way for soot pollution.  The Environmental Protection Agency, the federal group tasked with overseeing air quality in the U.S., said the lung association's report \"paints a pessimistic picture based upon a problematic methodology.\"  In a statement obtained by USA TODAY, the EPA said that the agency's \"methods for determining air quality, which are based on the Clean Air Act and the latest science, show continued improvements in measures of U.S. air quality in recent years and into the future.\"  The nation's cleanest cities, according to the report, were Bangor, Maine; Burlington, Vermont; Honolulu, Hawaii; and Wilmington, North Carolina. To make the list of cleanest cities, \"a city must experience no high ozone or high particle pollution days and must rank among the 25 cities with the lowest year-round particle pollution levels,\" the report said.

The compound, known as FCC Oakdale, has emerged as ground zero in the federal prison system’s struggle to contain coronavirus behind bars. The situation there is so dire that the local health department told the federal government there was no need to test inmates anymore for the coronavirus, officials said. Those showing symptoms should be presumed to have it.  On Wednesday, the agency confirmed that two inmates at Oakdale had died. They identified one as 43-year-old Nicholas Rodriquez and were still attempting to notify the second man’s family Wednesday evening. Just days earlier, another man, serving a 27-year drug sentence, died at a hospital from the coronavirus. Officials said both that man and Rodriquez had serious, long-term, underlying health conditions. They are the only deaths so far in federal prisons, but state and local lockups have seen deaths.  So far, 11 Oakdale inmates have tested positive, 19 others are in the hospital and suspected of having the disease, 32 are in isolation with symptoms and 82 have been quarantined because of possible exposure, according to local union president Ronald Morris.  In addition, 13 staff members have tested positive, one is hospitalized in an intensive care unit at a hospital in Alexandria, about 50 minutes away, and about 16 others are out of work awaiting test results.  “It is a mess here,” Morris said.  The Bureau of Prisons said the uptick is “consistent with the surge of positive cases in Louisiana” and because there were so many cases at the prison, local health officials have recommended not testing anyone else who shows COVID-19 symptoms and instead presume they are positive.  But Kevin Litten, a spokesman for the Louisiana Department of Health, said officials did not tell the prison to stop testing prisoners. He said state officials advised the prison, in the absence of testing, to isolate prisoners with symptoms.  Louisiana has emerged as a hot spot for the virus, with the death toll at 273. The number of confirmed cases grew 23% overnight, topping 6,400, according to the latest figures. About 23% are hospitalized. Nationwide, there are more than 200,000 cases.  “What’s happening in Oakdale is a tragic and avoidable example of what happens when officials fail to heed the advice of public health experts who have warned from the beginning that prisons and jails would become dangerous breeding grounds for this disease,” said Katie Schwartzmann, legal director of the Louisiana American Civil Liberties Union. “This should be a wakeup call to state and local officials that this is an imminent threat to public health that must be addressed immediately.”  The situation at Oakdale is fueling fear among inmates and staff members in the rest of the Bureau of Prisons system that the virus could spread just as rapidly at any of the other 121 correctional facilities, though the rate of infection compared with outside prison is low. Health officials have been warning for more than a decade about the dangers of epidemics in jails and prisons, which are ideal environments for virus outbreaks.  For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.  On Wednesday, the Bureau of Prisons moved into a new phase of its coronavirus response plan: a nationwide lockdown. In an effort to slow the virus’ spread, officers will lock all inmates in their cells for 14 days. The agency said in a statement that “to the extent practicable” inmates should still have access to services like mental health treatment and education programs.  Even as officials shift their focus to trying to combat a potential coronavirus epidemic, officers are continuing to face challenges of managing inmates and struggling with severe staffing shortages. Earlier this week, an inmate walked away from a minimum-security federal prison camp in Three Rivers, Texas. He’s now wanted by the U.S. Marshals Service.  At Oakdale, some staff members are working 32 hours straight to fill the gaps, Morris said. The roster is being stretched even thinner because some officers have to be at the hospital to guard inmates under treatment.  The Bureau of Prisons said wardens could notify officials in Washington if they need additional staff members but the agency wouldn’t say whether that’s happened at Oakdale.  Correction officers, inmates and advocates at different prisons around the U.S. have raised alarms about what they say is an inadequate supply of personal protective equipment and basic pandemic needs, like soap and hand sanitizer.  In a statement to The Associated Press last week, Bureau of Prisons Director Michael Carvajal insisted that the agency had inventoried its cleaning, sanitation and medical supplies and there were “ample supplies on hand and ready to be distributed or moved to any facility as deemed necessary.” The agency had also ordered additional supplies, he said.  But Morris and others say there’s a clear disconnect between Carvajal’s insistence that the agency has enough personal protective gear in stock and the situation at the Louisiana prison complex.  Morris said poor planning left Oakdale with short supplies of things like N95 masks, gowns and face shields. Only after staffers kept pestering supervisors for gear did the prison order 10,000 N95 masks that are supposed to be delivered this week, he said. The prison is also running low on hand sanitizer, with management telling staff it’s having trouble finding some to purchase, he said.  At a prison camp in Pensacola, Florida, staff members went out and obtained their own masks to wear this week. But they were stopped and told by the warden that they couldn’t wear them because it could incite panic among inmates and fellow staff members, a person familiar with the matter told the AP.  The person was not permitted to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.  The agency said whether officers could wear masks depends on several factors, including whether an institution has an active case and each employee’s job description.   ___  Sisak reported from New York.

Officials with the Virginia Department of Health's (VDH) Crater Health District said in a news release Saturday evening that no additional details about the victim would be released to \"protect patient confidentiality.\"  “We are so sorry to hear of the loss of a Crater Health District resident. Our sincere condolences go out to their family and friends,” Crater Health District Director Alton Hart Jr. said. “It is especially important to remember elderly individuals and those with underlying health conditions are at greater risk of complications from COVID-19, including death. These at-risk individuals are strongly advised to take steps to minimize contact with others who are ill, practice social distancing, and stay at home as much as possible.”  Earlier Saturday health officials said a man in Emporia and a woman in Greensville County tested positive for COVID-19.  Health department officials said the man, who is in his 30s, is self–isolating at home and the woman, who is in her 70s, is hospitalized.  Additionally, a Hopewell man who recently traveled to New York tested positive for COVID-19 Friday. Officials said he is \"isolated at home and monitoring his health.\"  The Crater Health District serves Dinwiddie, Emporia, Greensville, Hopewell, Petersburg, Prince George, Surry and Sussex.  Hart said officials expect to see more cases as testing increases across the Commonwealth.  \"It is important for everyone to continue practicing personal public health precautions, especially social distancing and hand and surface hygiene,\" Hart said. \"These are the most effective ways to minimize the spread of illness and keep yourself and those around you healthy.”  VDH Epidemiologist Senior E. Katrina Saphrey said people who are close contacts of someone with COVID-19 have a higher risk for infection.  \"Others at higher risk for infection are those who live in or have recently been in an area with ongoing spread of COVID-19,” Saphrey said.  Officials said COVID-19 is mainly spread via respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes.  \"Most patients with COVID-19 have mild to moderate symptoms,\" officials said. \"However, in a small proportion of patients, COVID-19 can lead to more severe illness, including death, particularly among those who are older or those who have chronic medical conditions. Symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Symptoms appear within 14 days after exposure to an infectious person.\"  VDH officials offered these tips to lower the risk from spreading respiratory germs like COVID-19:  Stay home when you are sick.  Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer only if soap and water are not available.  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.  Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.  Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.  Avoid contact with sick people.  Practice social distancing. Maintain at least six feet of space between yourself and other individuals when out in public.  Avoid crowds of more than 10 people.  \"If you are 65 years or older, or if you have a serious chronic medical conditions (e.g., heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, compromised immune system), you should seriously consider staying at home,\" officials said.  COVID-19 cases in Virginia climb to 739  Officials said 135 more people tested positive for COVID-19 out of the 1,829 people tested since Friday's update. That brings Virginia's total number of cases to 739.  Officials said 99 people remain hospitalized and 17 people have died as a result of COVID-19-related illnesses.  VDH data showed the coronavirus has most impacted people aged 50 to 69 since that group accounts for more than 36 percent of cases.  \"But we're also seeing cases in people in their 20s,\" Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said Friday. \"Ninety-three of the 604 cases are in the age range of 20 to 29 years.\"  In fact, Northam said that group accounts for 16 percent of cases in the state.  \"There has been some talk, and I have seen activity around Virginia, that this only affects the elderly. Well, it doesn't. It affects all of us, \"Northam said. \"So take this seriously and please stay home.\"  Slightly more men have been infected by the virus at 382 cases versus the 349 cases reported in women.  Officials are investigating \"distinct clusters\" where there is \"local transmission\" of the virus in Virginia.  Those clusters include 156 cases in Fairfax County, 75 in Arlington County, 65 in James City County, 56 in Prince William County, 53 in Loudon County and 35 in Virginia Beach.

The proposal is laid out in a document released Thursday entitled \"Restoring America's Competitive Nuclear Energy Advantage.\" The long-awaited recommendations come from the national Nuclear Fuel Working Group, a panel President Donald Trump established last year.  Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, in a statement announcing the strategy, claimed it was \"a matter of national security\" to \"take bold steps to preserve and grow the entire U.S. nuclear energy enterprise.\"  The strategy calls for the U.S. government to:  \"Take bold action to revive and strengthen the uranium mining industry, support uranium conversion services, end reliance on foreign uranium enrichment capabilities, and sustain the current fleet, removing strategic vulnerabilities across the nuclear fuel cycle and restoring a world-class workforce to provide benefits to the U.S. and to compete in the international market.\"  \"Leverage American technological innovation and advanced nuclear Research, Development, and Demonstration (RD&D) investments to accelerate technical advances and regain American nuclear energy leadership\"; and  \"Move into markets currently dominated by Russian andChinese State Owned Enterprises (SOE) and recover our position as the world leader in exporting best-in-class nuclear energy technology, and with it, strong non-proliferation standards.\"  Reuters reported that the strategy would also allow \"the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to deny imports of certain uranium supplies from Russia and China for national security purposes.\"  The document also suggested an attack on a federal environmental law could be needed to boost uranium mining:  SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Never Miss a Beat.

Throughout the regulatory process, National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analysis is required, in addition to other environmental or land preservation analyses. These procedures and processes can take years to successfully navigate, which equates to higher project risk and higher permitting and licensing costs. Efforts to streamline governmental and regulatory processes have the potential to increase the competitiveness of all new uranium production facilities.  The Center for Biological Diversity joined NRDC in criticizing the plan, expressing particular concern over how domestic uranium mining could \"industrialize public lands\" and wreak ecological havoc.  \"These dangerous recommendations invite more deadly uranium pollution in rural communities and places like Grand Canyon National Park,\" said Taylor McKinnon, a campaigner with the conservation group.  \"Every federal dollar wasted on this effort is a dollar stolen from cleaning up the industry's toxic pollution legacy in the Navajo Nation and across the West,\" he continued. \"It's despicable to risk irreversible harm to spectacular wild places by propping up uranium companies that can't compete in global markets.\"  Other public lands could be at risk as well, said The Wilderness Society.  \"Enriching special interests with taxpayer resources so they can plunder national treasures like Bears Ears and the Grand Canyon will harm our land, water, and public health,\" said America Fitzpatrick, senior representative of The Wilderness Society. \"To do so in the face of a global pandemic is an abuse of public trust.\"  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 18, "joy": 5, "negative": 2, "disgust": 3, "positive": 25, "anger": 13, "surprise": 3, "fear": 8, "trust": 4}, "metadata": ["trump", "country's", "donald", "dan", "announcing", "reuters", "russia", "china", "preservation", "deadly", "pollution", "global", "america", "pandemic"]}, {"text": " Hide Transcript Show Transcript  US SOME GUIDANCE FOR PREGNANT WOMEN. >> HERE AT AURORA SINAI MEDICAL CENTER AND OTHER AREA HOSPITALS, YOU’RE ONLY GOING TO BE ABLE ALLOWED ONE SUPPORT PERSON BY YOUR SIDE DURING YOUR DELIVERY THIS PANDEMIC IS ADDING ANOTHER LAYER OF STRESS TO AN ALREADY STRESSFUL SITUATION. >> THERE IS SO MUCH ANXIETY AROUND BIRTH, AND THIS IS MAGNIFIED RIGHT NOW. >> WE SPOKE WITH DOCTOR JASON FOIL WITH AURORA WOMEN’S PAVILLION IN WEST ALLIS.

Hodkinson also slammed mandatory mask mandates as completely pointless.  “Masks are utterly useless. There is no evidence base for their effectiveness whatsoever,” he said.  “Paper masks and fabric masks are simply virtue signalling. They’re not even worn effectively most of the time. It’s utterly ridiculous.

Republican Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt, however, issued a statement Wednesday against Kelly's order, calling it \"unconstitutional.\"  “The Office of Attorney General strongly encourages all Kansans participating in religious services or activities to voluntarily comply with the new restrictions on religious mass gatherings in order to protect public health,” Schmidt wrote in a memorandum to law enforcement agencies and prosecutors statewide.  “Nevertheless, … we also strongly discourage law enforcement from attempting to enforce the requirements of EO 20-18 as violations of the criminal law. In our view, Kansas statute and the Kansas Constitution’s Bill of Rights each forbid the governor from criminalizing participation in worship gatherings by executive order.”  According to the New York Times, there have been over 1,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Kansas and approximately 38 deaths. Effective March 30, all residents are required to abide by a stay-at-home order until at least Sunday, April 19.  More than 1.5 million people have tested positive for the coronavirus globally. Of those, more than 88,000 have died from it, and more than 329,000 have recovered. The United States has seen at least 431,000 confirmed cases, with over 14,000 deaths and nearly 24,000 reported recoveries.

As cases of COVID-19 continue to rise -- numbering more than 7,400 and 123 deaths as of Wednesday -- Bolivia and Colombia became the latest countries to impose a total lockdown, while Chile extended its school closures until the end of April.  Here are the latest measures taken in several Latin American nations: - Bolivia - Bolivia is closing its borders and ordering a strict lockdown until April 15 starting at midnight Wednesday, President Jeanine Anez said as she declared a state of \"sanitary emergency.\" The steps are designed to add teeth to a lockdown that was ordered on Sunday but has largely been ignored.  More police and soldiers have been deployed to enforce the measures, Anez said.  There would be narrow exceptions to who can cross the borders and the times at which people can be outside their homes, she added.  - Colombia - A three-week total lockdown began just after midnight Tuesday and is set to last until April 12.  \"Stay at home, prevent the virus from spreading and save lives,\" said President Ivan Duque.  Nearly 500 cases of the deadly virus have been reported in Colombia, which has a population of 48 million.  The capital city Bogota had already been on lockdown since Sunday on the orders of the mayor.  - Chile - About 1.3 million residents of Santiago -- including those of the Chilean capital's most affluent neighborhoods -- will be on lockdown for least a week starting at 0100 GMT Thursday, officials said.  This follows an order by authorities to extend school closures until May. Classes were suspended on March 16, just under two weeks after the first coronavirus case was recorded.  Chile has reported more than 1,100 infections and three deaths.  - Panama - Panama will allow the cruise ship Zaandam -- operated by the Holland America cruise line -- to sail through its canal even though there are 42 people aboard with flu-like symptoms, Health Minister Rosario Turner said Wednesday.  The vessel, with 1,800 passengers, set sail on March 7 from Buenos Aires headed for San Antonio on the central coast of Chile.  But the ship had to alter its plans when ports along the way stopped it from docking due to coronavirus fears.  Every ship that reaches Panama must present a list of sick people, \"and if we suspect there are people with respiratory problems, they cannot land,\" Turner said.  The Zaandam is set to cross the 80-kilometer inter-oceanic Panama Canal on Thursday and meet up on the Caribbean side with another cruise ship, the Rotterdam, which is to deliver supplies and kits to test for COVID-19.  The aim is to reach Fort Lauderdale in Florida on March 30, its operator said.  There have been 558 cases of the virus in Panama, including eight deaths.  - Honduras - Soldiers have begun distributing food to locked-down residents in the poorest neighborhoods of the capital Tegucigalpa.  President Juan Orlando Hernandez said 800,000 poor families -- 3.2 million people -- would receive food to ensure they stayed indoors.  Honduras has recorded 36 COVID-19 cases so far.  - Brazil - President Jair Bolsonaro has warned of possible \"chaos\" and \"looting\" of supermarkets if state shutdowns ordered by the governors of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are not ended.  Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly scoffed at the severity of the deadly pandemic, previously criticized the closing of schools and businesses in Sao Paulo and Rio, two of the country's most populous states.  \"Companies aren't producing anything. They can't pay their employees. And if the economy collapses, there won't be any way to pay public officials. We are facing chaos,\" Bolsonaro said.  If that happens and supermarkets are looted, he added, \"we'll have chaos plus the virus.\" - Mexico - BBVA, the largest bank in Mexico, has predicted the coronavirus outbreak will cause the economy to contract by 4.5 percent in 2020.  The Spanish bank said Mexican exports would be hard hit by a reduction in demand from the United States, the largest trading partner, if virus containment measures continue.  BBVA also said remittances sent to family members in Mexico could be hit by rising unemployment in the United States.  Other banks, such as Barclays and Credit Suisse, predicted the economy would shrink by 2-4 percent.  On Wednesday, the Mexican government announced it would suspend all non-essential activities starting from the following day to help stem the spread of the virus.

(AP) — An overview of COVID-19 developments in Vermont on Tuesday:   STUDENT LOAN ASSISTANCE  The state of Vermont is taking part in a multi-state initiative to help thousands of people across the state with privately held student loans, the state announced Tuesday.  The relief will expand on protections provided by the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation and to federal student loan holders through the coronavirus relief package.  “With this initiative, we can expand these relief options to more Vermonters,” Vermont Gov. Phil Scott said in a news release announcing the program.  Student loan holders who need help should contact their student loan servicer or lender. It can provide a variety of options, including delaying payments for a minimum of 90 days, protections from negative credit reporting and ceasing debt collection lawsuits for 90 days.   ___   NUMBERS  The number of new cases of COVID-19 reported in Vermont increased by two to a total of 818 cases, the Vermont Health Department said in its daily update posted on its website. There have been 40 deaths.  The increase reported Tuesday was the smallest since the earliest days of the COVID-19 epidemic in early March.  Vermont Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said Monday the small increase shows the number of cases have plateaued in Vermont.   ___   UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE  The Vermont Department of Labor will be holding a number of virtual town halls this week to help Vermonters whose jobs have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.  On Tuesday, officials will review the application process for the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which provides unemployment benefits for people who were not previously eligible. Other virtual meetings will focus on basic unemployment claims and claims for the self-employed.  Details can be found on the department’s website.   ___   STATE COLLEGES  The Board of Trustees of the Vermont State College system is planning an emergency meeting Tuesday evening to continue its discussion about the future of the system.  Under a proposal announced by Chancellor Jeb Spaulding on Friday, the two campuses of Northern Vermont University in Johnson and Lyndon and the campus of Vermont Technical College in Randolph, which has another campus in Williston, would close. Liberal arts programs in Johnson and Lyndon would be moved to Castleton University.   ___   EQUIPMENT COLLECTION  Medical students from the University of Vermont’s Larner College of Medicine are working to collect unused personal protective from dentists, non-medical labs, secondary schools and other organizations that are currently closed or operating at a reduced levels.  The equipment would be donated to health care providers at the UVM Medical Center.  (Copyright (c) 2020 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Sign up here.  A Pennsylvania pastor said Tuesday he plans to organize an outdoor “Woodstock”-like service in protest of coronavirus stay-at-home orders and following the arrests of multiple pastors in the U.S for allegedly violating such orders.  Evangelist Jonathan Shuttlesworth said he will hold an \"outdoor Easter blowout service,\" even though Florida pastor Rodney Howard-Browne was arrested Monday for holding services the day before, potentially placing attendees at risk for COVID-19.  \"I’m gonna announce it. … We’re gonna hold an outdoor Easter blowout service. Not online. A national gathering. You come from all over, like Woodstock. And we’re gonna gather and lift up Jesus Christ,\" he said.  FLORIDA PASTOR'S LEGAL TEAM RESPONDS TO 'ENTIRELY INAPPROPRIATE' ARREST  \"I’m not ashamed that Dr. Rodney got arrested. I’m ashamed that when they wanted to arrest preachers for having church, in an entire state, there was only one to come for.\"  Megachurch pastor Howard-Browne, 58, was arrested Monday, accused of violating quarantine orders during a public health emergency and holding service at the River at Tampa Bay Church on Sunday. The gathering created a “dangerous environment\" for the church members and the larger community, according to Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister.   'Reckless disregard'  Howard-Browne reportedly held the gatherings despite warnings by police.  \"His reckless disregard for human life put hundreds of people in his congregation at risk and thousands of residents who may interact with them this week in danger,\" Chronister said during a news conference Monday.  The church livestreamed its morning “Main Event” service on its Facebook page, which showed congregants shoulder-to-shoulder, while the band was playing, according to the Tampa Bay Times.  Shuttlesworth said Howard-Browne's arrest came from simply \"having church\" when in reality he was arrested on second-degree misdemeanor charges of unlawful assembly and violating quarantine orders during a public health emergency, the paper said. Howard-Browne posted $500 bail about 40 minutes after being booked at a local jail.  Howard-Browne's legal team, Liberty Counsel, argued there's more to the story.  \"The sheriff and Hillsborough County will get a lesson on the Constitution and discriminatory application of the law,\" Mat Staver, Liberty Counsel founder and chairman, told Fox News.  It's unclear if the two pastors are friends, although Shuttlesworth posted a GIF with the caption \"YOU ARRESTED MY FRIEND?!\" on his Twitter page Tuesday. It's not certain if he was talking about Howard-Browne.  \"Pastor arrested for having a church service in his own building on Sunday, just like 1938 Germany.. and just like 1938 Germany, other pastors say nothing, or applaud the arrest!,\" Shuttlesworth also wrote on Twitter.  On Tuesday night, he livesteamed an over hourlong broadcast titled \"The Rodney Howard-Browne Tribute Special.\"   'Love thy neighbor'  A pastor of a Lousiana megachurch was also arrested on misdemeanor charges for holding Sunday services for hundreds of followers in the face of a state-wide coronavirus large gathering ban.  On Tuesday, Central police charged pastor Tony Spell with six counts of violating the Louisiana governor’s ban on large gatherings enacted to contain the sometimes-deadly coronavirus. His arrest came a day after the booking of Howard-Browne.  Spell's service drew an estimated 500 people to Life Tabernacle Church. He told Fox News he prayed for the officers who arrested him and said he was released after being fingerprinted and read his rights.  Following the arrest of Howard-Browne, Andrew Warren, state attorney for Florida's 13th Judicial Circuit, quoted a Bible verse during the Monday news conference, according to the Tampa Bay Times.  LOUISIANA PASTOR WHO DEFIED CORONAVIRUS ORDER ARRESTED ON MISDEMEANOR CHARGES  “I’d remind the good pastor of Mark 12:31, which said there’s no more important commandment than to love thy neighbor as thyself,” Warren said. “Loving your neighbors is protecting them, not jeopardizing their health by exposing them to this deadly virus.”  In the U.S., all 50 states plus the District of Columbia have reported confirmed cases of COVID-19, tallying over 189,035 illnesses and at least 4,000 deaths, as of early Wednesday. Pennsylvania has nearly 5,000 cases of the virus and 63 deaths.  The White House coronavirus task force said Tuesday that it projects 100,000 to 240,000 deaths from the virus and millions infected. Without any measures in place to mitigate the contagion's spread, those projections jump to between 1.5 million and 2.2 million deaths from COVID-19.

It has been named Yaravirus after Yara, a supernatural mermaid who lured soldiers underwater to live with her.  Researchers found over 90 per cent of Yaravirus genes have never been seen before, making it ‘mysterious’ and wholly unique.  The discovery comes amid the outbreak of a killer novel virus across the world which started in China.  COVID-19 coronavirus was first discovered in December 2019, and since, has killed more than 1,000 people and infected over 44,500.  Yaravirus was documented by scientists in January after they unexpectedly came across it at Lake Pampulha, an artificial lake in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte.  They sequenced the virus genome to look at its DNA, finding 74 genes in total. Only six of those had been recorded in literature before.  The other 68 have never been seen before, known as orphan genes.  A search of over 8,500 genetic material from across the globe in a scientific database offered no clues as to what Yaravirus might be closely related to.  The team, led by Brazil’s Federal University of Minas Gerais, said: ‘Yaravirus expands our knowledge of the diversity of DNA viruses.’  Yaravirus was taken from a single-celled creature called amoeba, which live in damp environments.  The scientists speculate Yaravirus is the first isolated case of an unknown group of an amoebal virus.  They write Yaravirus has ‘a new lineage of an amoebal virus with a puzzling origin and phylogeny’ in a published paper on the server bioRxiv.  ‘Most of the known viruses of amoeba have been seen to share many features that eventually prompted authors to classify them into common evolutionary groups,’ the authors write.  For now, Yaravirus doesn’t appear to pose any threat to humans. For a start, it cannot transfer to humans – only between amoeba.  It’s not unheard of for scientists to find distinct viruses, and in the years between 2016 and 2019, new discoveries in the world’s oceans surged from 15,222 to 195,728, Quanta reports.  Two of the senior members of the team that report Yaravirus – virologists Bernard La Scola from Aix-Marseille University in France, and Jônatas S. Abrahão from Brazil’s Federal University of Minas Gerais – are no strangers to unique viruses.  Two years ago, the pair helped to discover another water-dwelling viral novelty. Tupanvirus, also named after a mythological god, was found in a lake in Brazil.  Tupanvirus is a giant virus, so-called because they are protected by huge protein shells.  But Yaravirus is a much smaller specimen, and less complex. Importantly, the scientists said, it novel.  They said: ‘Contrary to what is observed in other isolated viruses of amoeba, Yaravirus is not represented by a large/giant particle and a complex genome, but at the same time carries an important number of previously undescribed genes.’  Another novel virus, discovered in December 2019, is currently spreading among the human population at a rapid speed.  COVID-19 coronavirus jumped from animals in a food market in China to humans and has since developed the ability to spread between people via a cough or sneeze.  So far what’s been described as ‘the worst enemy you can ever imagine’ has claimed more than 1,000 lives and struck down over 44,500 people in a matter of weeks.  It is feared the coronavirus has the potential to infect more than 60 per cent of the population if containment methods fail, based on a top Hong Kong medical officials predictions.   vanguard   Kindly Share This Story:  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 12, "positive": 12, "negative": 5, "disgust": 3, "joy": 3, "anger": 2, "surprise": 2, "fear": 5, "trust": 3}, "metadata": ["virus", "researchers", "outbreak", "coronavirus", "1,000", "infected", "documented", "scientific", "university", "humans", "viral", "spreading", "china", "cough", "feared", "containment", "hong", "kong"]}, {"text": "FOURTEEN more Covid-19 deaths have been confirmed in the Republic of Ireland - the highest number of deaths in one day since the outbreak began.  294 new confirmed cases have been diagnosed.  ⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news & updates  4 14 more coronavirus-related deaths have been confirmed in Ireland, bringing the death toll to 36 Credit: EPA  4 Ireland's Covid-19 lockdown kicked in today as the nation is told to stay at home for two weeks to curb the spread of the disease Credit: AFP or licensors  4 Deserted streets as the mandatory 'stay at home' order came into effect Credit: PA:Press Association  4 Health Minister Simon Harris  All 14 deaths are patients in the east of the country and the median age of today's reported deaths is 81.

That's why she established Mental Health Awareness Week - to send a message to students alike and different - it's okay, not to be okay.  \"It's okay, it's not taboo.\"18-year-old Bella Dobrinski is talking about mental health.  \"I think it's a really important thing for kids, especially in high school you know we go through so much with athletics and music and school it can be a lot to kind of take on yourself,\" she said.  Back in February, she arranged with Minot High School and HOSA - Health Occupation Students of America, the club she's President of, to hold 'Mental Health Awareness Week,' at both MHS campuses.  Instead, due to the coronavirus, it's this week, with each day focusing on a different aspect of mental health awareness.For example, Thankful Thursday.  She said, \"We need to kind of take a step back and realize that we have a lot to be thankful for despite what's going on.\"  Her teacher and HOSA advisor, Mitch Meyer, says he's thankful for her drive to make Mental Health Awareness Week happen.  She and the crew that is in HOSA and setting up mental health week, they've all done such a good job of putting together resources for kids,\" said Meyer.  Among those resources is something as simple as a green ribbon to show solidarity.  \"It's really great to see kids coming to the table and say 'hey I want to get one of those,' Meyer said. \"They're not going to initiate to come up and get a pin without identifying that, 'hey this is something serious and we need to take this seriously and let's all work together.'\"  He added that it's especially helpful that the push for mental health awareness comes from a peer.  While Bella took the initiative, other HOSA members say it was an easy ship to jump aboard.  \"She's very hard working and it's nice to have a president who is making HOSA more involved in the school and in the club alone,\" said HOSA member, Alissa Barber. \"And it's really nice to see that the whole club is coming together to get more involved and it's nice to have a leader like that, too.\"  Alissa and Bella agree that any bad feelings that come from struggles with mental health should be talked about.\"While I might be feeling down sometimes or really anxious, I don't have to go through it alone,\" Bella urged.  Knowing that there is support out there, she says it doesn't have to be all-consuming, even though sometimes it may feel like it.  She, herself, is a pretty busy girl.To name a few, she's the secretary of Honor Society, the vice president of the Spanish club, she plays the cello, was golf captain, and this is all on top of navigating her senior year and planning what comes after.  While the many aspects of life can be overwhelming, for her, they can be helpful, too.\"I realize that that's what makes me feel good so I try to keep my mental health in balance by doing all these things that I enjoy.\"  And for her peers who may not know what fuels them, she encourages them to have the confidence to find out.That's what makes Bella Dobrinski 'Someone You Should Know.'

Officials in Placer County, near Sacramento, said an elderly person who tested positive for COVID-19 Tuesday after returning from a San Francisco-to-Mexico cruise had died. The victim had underlying health problems, authorities said.  Washington state also announced another death, bringing its total to 10. Most of those who died were residents of a nursing home in Kirkland, a suburb east of Seattle. At least 31 cases have been reported in the Seattle area, where researchers say the virus may have been circulating undetected for weeks.  Public officials in Washington faced demands that they take more extensive measures, including closing schools and canceling large events. While the state and Seattle have declared emergencies, giving leaders broad powers to suspend activities, they have not issued any direct orders to do so.  \"We have encouraged people who are responsible for large gatherings to give consideration whether it really makes sense to carry those on right now,\" Gov. Jay Inslee said. \"Right now, we are deferring to the judgment ... of these organizations.\"  While some individual schools and businesses have closed, the governor said large-scale school closings have not been ordered because \"there are so many ramifications for families and businesses,\" especially for health care workers who might not be able to go to work because of child care responsibilities. However, he said, the situation is fluid and he will consult with health experts.  Local and state health officials have not recommended school closings or cancellations of activities but said they respect the decisions of local school leaders.  Jennifer Hayles, 41, of Kirkland, the epicenter of Washington's outbreak, said she was appalled that Inslee and health officials haven't canceled next week's Emerald City Comic Con. The four-day cosplay and pop-culture event draws close to 100,000 people each year, and some participants, including D.C. Comics and Penguin Random House, have pulled out over the virus.  Hayles said she spent hundreds of dollars on tickets and other items related to the event but will have to skip it because she has a compromised immune system.  \"There's a lot of people who are talking about the economic cost of people forced to pull out of Comic Con, but if we have an explosion of cases of coronavirus, the economic cost is going to be much higher,\" Hayles said.  Lakshmi Unni said that she was keeping her son, an eighth-grader at Redmond Middle School in Seattle's eastern suburbs, home on Wednesday, and that she had urged the school board and principal to close.  \"Yesterday at least three kids were coughing,\" Unni said. \"We don't know if they were sick with the virus, but if they do become sick, the chances of spreading are very, very high.\"  Some schools and businesses aren't waiting.  School officials in Renton, south of Seattle, announced that Hazen High School will close for the rest of the week after a student tested positive for the coronavirus. Online petitions urged officials to also close other schools on Seattle's east side.  The F5 technology company closed its 44-story tower in downtown Seattle after learning an employee had been in contact with someone who tested positive for the virus. Outdoor recreation giant REI shut down its Seattle-area operations for two days as a precaution.  A federal immigration field office near Tukwila also closed after an employee visited the Life Care Center, the Kirkland nursing home. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said the move was a precaution and the place will remain closed for 14 days.  Health officials in North Carolina reported that a person from Wake County tested positive for the illness after visiting the Kirkland nursing home. The patient's flight from the Seattle area to the Raleigh-Durham airport raised questions about whether other passengers were exposed to the virus.  \"My understanding is we have the manifest. Now the trick is to go find them,\" said Robert Redfield of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Life Care Center said on its website that it is screening employees for symptoms before they start work and as they leave. The nursing home is prohibiting visits from family members,  Shortly before the California death was announced, Princess Cruise Lines notified passengers of its Grand Princess that federal health officials are investigating a \"small cluster\" of coronavirus cases connected to its mid-February voyage. It asked current passengers to stay in their cabins until they were cleared by medical staff, and said those who had been on the previous voyage should contact their doctor if they develop a fever or other symptoms.  The Grand Princess is at sea off Mexico and will return early to San Francisco, where CDC and company officials will meet to determine the course of action, the cruise line said.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has sprung into action in response to COVID-19, fanning out across the country to convert dozens of conference centers, dorms and hotels into makeshift hospitals in a herculean aid effort for American cities.  But as the engineers and contractors take their hammers and hard hats to the front lines of the evolving pandemic, social distancing measures are reducing estimates of hospital overload, raising questions about how many of the facilities constructed as part of the Corps' broader $1.7 billion COVID-19 response effort will ultimately be used at anywhere near capacity - or even at all.  The Corps says it is building at least 32 facilities through contractors, 17 of which the Pentagon says have been completed as of Friday, including at New York City's Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. The Corps says it is providing designs for another 52 temporary hospitals that states are erecting on their own. In total, the sites would add more than 33,000 beds nationwide, at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars.  States are already beginning to scale back. New York has pulled the brakes on opening three of the makeshift facilities the Army Corps of Engineers has completed in Westchester County and on Long Island, and has scrapped construction on another four. Virginia paused plans for three large field hospitals in Richmond, Hampton and Fairfax counties that it was planning to build using Army Corps plans. And Michigan downsized a Corps-built facility outside Detroit from 1,110 to 250 beds.  Sites that have opened so far have seen low occupancy rates. The first Corps-built makeshift hospital to come online, at the Javits Center, is about 20% occupied; it has roughly 200 patients at the moment, down from a little over 400 at its peak, according to a state official. Only about 33 patients have been treated at a 970-bed Army Corps-built facility at the TCF Center, a convention center in Detroit, since it opened on April 10, after hospitals in the area surged their capacity.  \"Regarding the convention center beds that the Army Corps of Engineers are building, they are building those in response to requests from governors in states,\" Air Force Gen. John Hyten, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the No. 2 officer at the Pentagon, said in a briefing Wednesday. \"I've been asked, 'Does it bother you when you look at those convention centers and you see that the beds are empty?' For gosh sakes, no. That's what I want to see.\"  Federal, state and local officials have echoed Hyten. They say the possibility that such facilities will not be fully occupied or even opened should be seen as an indication of success - a testament to the impact of social distancing restrictions, as well as measures hospitals have taken to free up and add beds, including by pausing elective surgeries.  Some officials also note that the makeshift hospital sites will now be ready if the nation faces a second wave of COVID-19 infections later in the year, which could stress hospitals even more if it coincides directly with the start of flu season.  The New York state official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly, said the state can get the Corps-built facilities that stopped short of opening running in 10 to 14 days and will do so at the first sign the numbers are moving in the wrong direction.  Michigan is also watching closely. \"A surge has hit and what we saw was hospitals were in a better position to manage the patient load last week, and so we are continuing to watch the situation closely,\" said Michelle Grinnell, a spokeswoman for the alternative-care facilities in Michigan.  \"We want to make sure [we have] the resources and the beds should the need be.\"  It isn't only overflow facilities the Army Corps of Engineers built that so far have seen low usage.  The military has also deployed two massive hospital ships, the USNS Comfort and USNS Mercy, to the East and West coasts, and sent Army field hospitals to the country's hardest-hit areas.  The Comfort, originally sent to treat non-covid patients but later converted to handle those infected with the virus, is expected to leave New York City as early as late April after treating about 180 patients over three weeks.  Some of the personnel from the USNS Mercy, currently in Los Angeles, have been reassigned to a skilled nursing facility in California's Orange County.  The Army, after establishing its first COVID-19 field hospital in Seattle earlier this month, shuttered that facility without seeing a single patient.  \"They were prepared for a situation where they wouldn't have the capacity in their hospitals, and so we built that capacity in record time,\" Army Chief of Staff Gen.Charles McConville said in a recent media briefing. \"And then when they realized that they had flattened the curve in Washington state, they decided they no longer needed that capability. We basically boxed that hospital back up.\"  The race to increase the number of hospital beds began in many states in March, when New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, said his state, the hardest hit in the nation, would be operating under a \"prepare for the worst, hope for the best\" approach. New York, according to the state official, set a goal to expand the number of hospital beds for COVID-19 patients in the state to 110,000.  That effort focused primarily on existing facilities. According to the New York state official, the governor directed hospitals to increase their capacity by 50%, with some medical centers converting cafeterias, lobbies and physical therapy units to spaces that could handle COVID-19 patients.  At the same time, hospitals stopped taking elective surgery patients to free up beds. Patients that normally might have been admitted out of caution in some cases stayed home.  All told, New York scaled up to about 90,000 available beds over a few weeks, up from 53,000 initially, the official said. That occurred as the Army Corps of Engineers built alternative facilities such as the one at the Javits Center, initially designed to take non-virus patients as a \"relief valve\" for local hospitals but later converted to a virus facility.  Social distancing restrictions began impacting the infection rate, and ultimately New York peaked with about 20,000 COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals. Today, that number is down to about 15,500, the official said.  In a statement, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said that when the Army Corps facilities were commissioned at the request of individual states, modeling data indicated that hospitals could be overwhelmed.  But aggressive social distancing decreased the need for the makeshift facilities, FEMA explained in the statement, adding that \"they remain a viable response option if needed in the future.\"  Some of the models officials were relying on changed. On April 5, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington's School of Medicine - one of the main modelers officials have been consulting - revised its forecast for needed hospital beds down.  \"People are relying a lot on models, and we already know the models are problematic because they're based on assumptions about a virus pathogen that we're still learning about,\" said Peter Jay Hotez, dean of the Baylor College of Medicine's National School of Tropical Medicine.  President Trump praised the Corps' construction blitz on Monday at the White House, saying its commander, Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, was doing an incredible job in assisting the virus response.  \"We're creating a lot of space for people, just in case,\" the president said. \"In some cases, they probably will be using them.\"  Semonite said what's important is to have a very \"agile plan\" when it comes to additional hospital beds, because \"the virus gets a vote.\"  The Army Corps of Engineers said it couldn't provide the cost of the 32 makeshift hospitals it is building across the nation, because some of the contracts aren't finalized yet.  The cost of the facilities contracted out so far has varied. For example, in New York, the initial contract for construction of a makeshift hospital at the Westchester County Center amounted to $15 million. Though completed, it isn't slated to open yet, the New York state official said.  In a statement, Army Corps of Engineers spokesman Eugene Pawlik said the $1.7 billion budget the Corps has received from FEMA for its COVID-19 response includes not only the construction of the 32 sites but also other mission assignments, such as a fusion cell at Corps headquarters for response planning.  \"It is a good news story for the states that the levels of potentially needed health care augmentation have not been reached at the existing alternate care facilities,\" Pawlik said.  The U.S. military, meanwhile, is increasingly sending uniformed medical personnel directly into local hospitals to help overburdened health-care workers handle the influx of COVID-19 patients and keeping alternative health-care facilities at convention centers on standby with fewer staff.  As of April 21, the military had more than 500 Army, Navy and Air Force medical personnel embedded in 10 hospitals in New York City. Many are part of what the military is calling Urban Augmentation Medical Task Forces - groups of about 85 people each, including emergency physicians, pulmonologists, internists and nurses - who have been deployed there and to New Jersey, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Michigan and Texas. Nationally, the number of personnel embedded in hospitals is 900.  In some cases, the military medical personnel are embedding in hospitals, and in other cases they are operating their own wards.  For example, according to Northern Command Commander Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy, military medical forces are manning a pod on the seventh floor of Bennett Medical Center in Stamford, Connecticut, where 35 military medical personnel are staffing up to 56 beds. A Navy medical unit composed of about 75 personnel is similarly augmenting a city hospital in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  Lt. Gen. Laura Richardson, commander of U.S. Army North, said military medical task forces are going into Tewksbury Hospital in Massachusetts and Atlantic City and Salem Medical Centers in New Jersey. They may also integrate into hospitals in Philadelphia, she said, or staff a makeshift hospital set up in a Temple University arena.  As of April 21, more than 50,000 service members have taken part in the COVID-19 response effort, including at least 4,200 medical personnel in the United States. That figure includes personnel on the two hospital ships, Northern Command said.  The U.S. military at the same time is grappling with the impact of the virus on its own personnel. The force has more than 3,900 confirmed cases as of Thursday, of which more than 1,200 have recovered.  (c) 2020, The Washington Post.

It is no surprise that the current lockdown has adversely impacted the share market. But it is a fact that the traders will have to put up with the situation, since the market is only echoing the general sentiments.

TR Anandan   Coimbatore   Cyber-security threat  This refers to ‘Personal devices run risks of cyber attacks as people work from home’ (www.thehindubusinessline.com). The reported fact that there has been an increase in cyber attacks on personal computer networks, mobile phones, VPNs and routers since employees were asked to work from home must serve as a wake up call for various stakeholders. This view gains more prominence since at least five new threats have emerged since February this year. Moreover, concerns that the law enforcement agencies are more interested in maintianing the lockdown, could hardly be overlooked.  Since this report categorically reveals the modus operandi of cyber criminals using various modern tricks to invade these devices, it obviously shifts the onus to corporates to ensure that any such unauthorised intrusion gets immediately flagged. Further, the access to all personal devices must be remotely controlled. Mind you, the theft/pilferage of any company’s vital statistical data, business secrets and internal financial position etc, may remain a potent threat.   Vinayak G   Bengaluru   Humanitarian crisis  The coronavirus has given some visibility to India’s poor, but in a hard and heart-rending way. The class divide in India has become starker during the nationwide lockdown.  Visuals of migrant workers walking long distances, being herded into trucks and hosed with ‘disinfectants’ show the unfolding human tragedy in India.  It is important for the government to respect the rights of people while implementing restrictions. The way the hapless migrant workers made to squat on the roadside, shut their eyes and hosed with a ‘disinfectant’ and robbed of their dignity in UP’s Bareilly was dehumanising.  The Bareilly incident was an illustrative example of the administration’s ‘entrenched habit’ of looking at the poor as no more than ‘herd’. It represented in microcosm the kind of treatment the country’s impoverished people receive at the hands of the officialdom.  The lockdown was absolutely needed (and fully justified) to stop the virus from spreading and save lives, but the government should have thought through and acted much better to protect the vulnerable people from the scourge of poverty as much from the scourge of disease.  When the pandemic puts the impoverished segments of the population into aggravated deprivation and distress, it falls on the government to do all that it can to support them. Its response must match the impact of the crisis, and be equitable too.

Dressed in a suit, and looking and sounding relatively assured, Johnson said in a video posted on Twitter after his discharge from St. Thomas’ Hospital in London that it was “hard to find the words” to express his debt of gratitude to the NHS for saving his life “no question.”  He listed a number of the frontline staff members who cared for him during his week-long stay at St. Thomas’ Hospital in London but singled out two nurses who stood by his bedside for 48 hours “when things could have gone either way.”  The prime minister said the nurses he identified as Jenny from Invercargill on New Zealand’s South Island and Luis from Portugal, near Porto, were the reason that “in the end, my body did start to get enough oxygen.”  “Because for every second of the night they were watching and they were thinking and they were caring and making the interventions I needed,” he said. “So that is how I also know that across this country, 24 hours a day, for every second of every hour, there are hundreds of thousands of NHS staff who are acting with the same care and thought and precision as Jenny and Luis.”  After his release from the hospital, Johnson made his way to Chequers, the prime minister’s country retreat northwest of London, and on the advice of his medical team won’t be returning to work immediately, his office said in statement.  It’s unclear what involvement Johnson will have in this week’s anticipated extension to the nationwide lockdown the prime minister announced on March 23 in response to the worldwide virus pandemic.  Johnson, 55, was the first world leader confirmed to have the virus. His COVID-19 symptoms, including a cough and a fever, at first were described as mild, and he worked from home during the first few days of self-isolation.  But he was admitted to St. Thomas’ on April 5 after his condition worsened and transferred the following day to the intensive care unit, where he received oxygen but was not put onto a ventilator. Johnson spent three nights in the ICU before he was moved back to a regular hospital ward on Thursday.  Johnson’s pregnant partner, Carrie Symonds, cheered the prime minister’s improved health in a series of tweets, saying she “cannot thank our magnificent NHS enough.”  There “were times last week that were very dark indeed,” Symonds wrote. “My heart goes out to all those in similar situations, worried sick about their loved ones.”  The government confirmed Sunday that the U.K. became the fourth European country after Italy, Spain and France to reach the grim milestone of 10,000 virus-related deaths. It said 737 more people who tested positive for the coronavirus had died, taking the total recorded in the U.K. to 10,612.  The figure reported Sunday represented a second straight daily decline in number of deaths, although the lower figures may be due to delays related with the Easter weekend.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock said this is a “somber day” for the country in its battle against this “invisible killer.”  With the day-to-day death tolls in Italy and Spain on a downward slope, there were growing fears the U.K. might end up as the country with the most virus deaths in Europe. However, the pace of new confirmed cases and hospitalizations in the U.K. appears to be plateauing, a trend that officials hope will show up in fewer deaths in the near future.  Wellcome Trust director Jeremy Farrar, a scientific adviser to the British government, said the U.K. was likely to be “one of the worst, if not the worst-affected country in Europe.”  He told the BBC that Britain has “lessons to learn” from Germany, where much more widespread early testing for the virus and aggressive contact tracing have been accompanied by many fewer coronavirus deaths.  Hancock on Sunday announced a new NHS contact tracing app that will anonymously alert users if someone they were in significant contact with in the previous few days tests positive for the virus.  While Johnson convalesces, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is handling the nation’s response to the pandemic that has infected at least 1.81 million worldwide and killed more than 112,000 people. Experts say those numbers seriously understate the impact of the pandemic, due to limited testing and different ways of counting the dead.  Johnson’s Conservative government has come under fire for its slow response to confronting the pandemic - allowing tens of thousands to gather at the Cheltenham horse racing festival in mid-March, for example. It’s also faced criticism for its slow roll out of a coronavirus testing program.  In the past few days, the government also faced acute criticism over a lack of personal protective equipment for frontline hospital workers amid reports that some nurses had resorted to cutting up garbage bags to cover themselves. The Royal College of Nursing has piled more pressure on the government, urging members to refuse to treat patients as a “last resort” if adequate protections are not provided.  Hancock said he did not have an update on how many NHS workers with the virus have died following the 19 he confirmed on Saturday. He said efforts to procure more PPE are“moving in the right direction …. but until everyone gets the PPE they need, then we won’t rest.”  The prime minister also thanked the British people for the sacrifices they are making to get on top of the pandemic.  “I want you to know that this Easter Sunday I do believe that your efforts are worth it, and are daily proving their worth,” Johnson said.  “Because although we mourn every day those who are taken from us in such numbers, and though the struggle is by no means over, we are now making progress in this incredible national battle against coronavirus.”   ___  Follow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak  Sign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters  Copyright © 2020 The Washington Times, LLC.

Jay Inslee ordered more schools to close in an attempt to keep the coronavirus from spreading.  Some companies asked their employees to work from home early-on during the outbreak, but obviously not everybody works a job where that kind of flexibility is possible.  Now, rideshare drivers are sounding the alarm. So many people are working from home, Uber and Lyft drivers say they are barely making enough money to pay for lunch.  “Today I made less than $15 since this morning,” said driver Ubah Dahran, adding that the coronavirus outbreak has taken a chunk of her income.  First Avenue in Seattle was practically empty during the Thursday evening commute. That means rideshare drivers had a hard time finding customers; some spent hours idling without making a dime.  “I did pay my bills for this month, but I don’t know about next month,” she said.  “I have no fear from the virus because of what I have back home,” said driver Ahmed Mahamud. “I have no food on the table. I have no money to pay the rent.”  Mahamud used to count on tech workers and others needing a ride to the airport, but now even a 16-hour shift leaves him deeper in the red.  “I made $18.17 the whole day,” he said.  The ridesharecompanies say they have been handing out cleaning supplies to drivers and will offer compensation for any who fall ill to Covid-19  “Since the virus is getting worse and worse and worse, people are not coming out at all,” said Mahamud.  But the drivers’ union, Teamsters 117, went further by urging public officials to halt evictions and have asked both Uber and Lyft to pay drivers an emergency income in addition to helping with mortgage and rent.  Drivers who can find a fare feel lucky and some willing to work through a pandemic believe feeding their family feels like a bigger crisis than coronavirus.  “I cannot sit home,” said Dahran. “I mean because have four kids, I have to feed my kids.  The drivers’ union sent letters asking for relief from state and local officials, and also to Lyft and Uber saying without intervention drivers would quickly face an economic crisis.

Thursday's food bank missions in Mesa and Tucson were among the first since Gov. Doug Ducey activated the Guard last week in response to the coronavirus outbreak. They come as state health officials said there is now “widespread” community spread of the virus from person to person.  For now, the Guard has about 750 members activated and its mission is limited to assisting grocery stores and food banks. But Ducey last week said he may need to activate as many as 5,500 guardsmen for missions such as building hospitals, organizing a medical corps or assisting law enforcement.  At United Food Bank in Mesa, about two dozen soldiers wearing latex gloves worked alongside volunteers from a nearby high school to pack more than 1,000 bags of food in less than an hour. They walked by pallets of food, grabbing green beans, applesauce, kidney beans, peas, peanut butter, macaroni and cheese, cream of mushroom soup and rice for each bag.  The food will be distributed through drive-up service at the Mesa Convention Center on Friday. Last Friday, United Food Bank served 1,200 families, more than double the typical demand of 500. It's expecting 2,000 this week, said Dave Richins, president and CEO. At the same time, many volunteers have canceled their shifts.  “The ability for me to actually come and help and do things like this is — not to sound too cliche — but what I'm meant to do. This is what I see as my purpose,” said Staff Sgt. Nicholas Muños, 29, a Northern Arizona University student who joined the National Guard after finishing a nine-year active duty stint with the Army.  Muños, originally from Safford in eastern Arizona, said juggling his online schooling with his Guard activation has made for long days but his professors have been understanding.  Guardsmen have served earlier missions at St. Mary's Food Bank in Phoenix.  The number of known coronavirus cases in Arizona rose to 508 with eight dead, the Arizona Department of Health Services reported. More than half were in Maricopa County. All but two eastern counties — Gila and Greenlee — now have cases and are subject to business restrictions imposed by Ducey.  Counties with known cases of COVID-19 are subject to a state order to close bars, indoor gyms and certain other businesses and to allow restaurants to provide only takeout and pickup service. The Navajo Nation has reported 69 cases in Arizona and New Mexico, up 20 from a day earlier.  With large sectors of the economy locked down, the number of unemployment claims has soared, shattering earlier records.  The Community Food Bank of Southern Arizona is seeing double the demand for food that it saw at this time last year, said Norma Cable, a spokeswoman. About 30 guardsmen helped pack bags at a Tucson warehouse Thursday.  “We do have food available, it's just a question of getting it into that bag and getting it assembled and getting it out,” Cable said. “That's the tricky part.”  For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.  Arizona's largest homeless shelter says it has received a grant of $50,000 from the Arizona Lottery to keep operating during the pandemic, as nonprofits worry that it is only a matter of time before the virus explodes among the thousands of people living on the streets in the Phoenix metropolitan area.  Lisa Glow, who oversees Central Arizona Shelter Services in downtown Phoenix, said Thursday the money comes at a critical time when providers need to spend more for cleaning and providing educational materials aimed at keeping homeless people safe. Glow said no cases were reported yet at her shelter.  The shelter houses 470 but the population has slowly dropped to 370 people over the last 10 days so sufficient social distancing can be guaranteed between beds, Glow said.

Arrest warrant issued for Tampa megachurch pastor who led packed services despite safer-at-home orders  Fox 13 News ^ | March 30, 2020 | Staff   Posted on by C19fan  The pastor of a Tampa megachurch is facing charges after refusing to close its doors despite a \"safer at home\" order in effect in Hillsborough County, meant to stop the spread of COVID-19.

To: C19fan  Someone is jonesing for a First Amendment smackdown. SHALL....MAKE.....NO.....LAW!!!   To: C19fan  New York Mayor Bill deBlasio Announces Immediate Government Suspension of First Amendment… New York Mayor Bill deBlasio is officially attempting to establish himself as the United States first totalitarian dictator by announcing a revocation of all New York City citizen rights under the first amendment. A stunning move. “[Government] shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” In a stunning announcement Mayor deBlasio threatens that all religious services will be forcibly closed by city authorities “permanently” if they do not comply with the established dictates of city government. WATCH: Will de Blasio keep people from expressing their freedom of religion? It's not just Florida. Let us be clear, the government can request, suggest and recommend that faith-based assemblies suspend their services; and in many cases those churches and religious groups may indeed choose to suspend their services. However, under no circumstance, including: war, famine or virus pandemics that could leave only a hand-full of people alive, can the government force the suspension; or punish those who refuse to comply. Religious worship, including the assembly therein, is enshrined within the first amendment as it carries the first and ultimate essential service. There is absolutely no situation where that right can be removed. Obviously de Blasio is surrounded by far-left sycophants and members of the totalitarian state. However, there is no legal adviser who would ever inform an official, any official, that they carry the power to supersede the preeminent constitutional right of their citizens. Worse still is the use of the word “permanently” when de Blasio announces his unconstitutional suspension of rights. The mayor threatens to permanently close buildings? What kind of mindset would even fathom forcing the permanent closure of houses of worship because they defy unconstitutional dictates from the state? This decree by the New York mayor should alarm everyone. Accept the removal of the primary right of U.S. citizens and there is no longer a country for coronavirus to infect.

Looking back at my call to “buy stuff,” the Fed did exactly what I expected by unleashing an alphabet-soup of acronym programs - forcing people to buy stocks. In fact, many of the oversold shares I was buying into the darkest days of March proceeded to bounce dramatically since then. They gave money away and I hope you got some.  As the market has rallied, I’ve had some time to think and put things into perspective. On one hand, “Project Zimbabwe” is in full force. Now that the Federal Reserve has accepted that the US Dollar will be collateral damage in their bailouts, they won’t accept anything less than new highs in the stock market. On the other hand, the global economy has forever changed.  China unleashed a nasty flu on the world. It’s gone mainstream and there’s nothing that we can do to avoid it. We’re all going to get it and most of us are going to be just fine. We can accept that and go on with life (while recommending that those at risk stay quarantined), or we can shut the global economy, cocoon up and wait for the virus to burn itself out. The issue is that the virus won’t burn out because its in every country and will re-emerge almost immediately as soon as people begin to interact. Even if you could eradicate it from any one country, you’d have to ban all trade and travel with every other country to avoid re-transmission. Basically, we’re past the point where quarantines help and we all need to accept that we’ll get this virus. The sooner that happens, the better for everyone.  Unfortunately, politicians want to win elections - not use logic. Therefore, we’re all trapped at home waiting for some germs to die. Depending on who you believe, we’ll be able to emerge from hiding sometime between May and July. The issue is that almost immediately, the virus will make a resurgence - then what?  Do we all go back into hiding? Do we go on with life and ignore the virus? What about the impacts to businesses? Would businesses bother to re-open if they think they’ll be closed again in six weeks? Will anyone re-hire workers only to let them go again? What about mandated “social distancing?” Will anyone fly again for years? What about hotels, restaurants and entertainment? Services are the core of our economy. What about the rest of the economy? Is anyone about to buy a new car anytime soon? What about construction? Will anyone need more space at a time when every business is trying to contract? What about the oil sector?  There are millions of employees in energy and its supply-chain. What happens to them? Services, manufacturing, construction and energy are the pillars of our economy. Despite the stock market’s overweighting, the FAANG+ isn’t representative of the economy.  I am amazingly lucky that I have so many friends in the global business community. Excluding a few niche sectors like tankers, I cannot think of a friend who’s called me up to say, “Kuppy, things are incredible here!”  Instead, they’re calling and crying.  No one has a clue what happens next. Many of my friends literally have no revenue - instead, they have a pile of invoices that they’re refusing to pay so that they can conserve their liquidity. They’re looking to cut costs and survive. No one is doing much else because everyone is in disbelief that they shut the global economy over a bad seasonal flu. If global governments were willing to do that, what else are they willing to do? Will they shut it again when COVID-20 shows up? What about when COVID-19 has a resurgence? Why re-hire? Why spend money? Everyone is confused.  I have this sneaking feeling that they open up the economy sometime in a month or so and no one shows up. Consumers are either scared of germs or scared to spend money because they don’t have job security or jobs at all. Everyone I know in finance assumes that we sort of ignore the period from March until June and then by July, we’re back to normal. What if it turns out that there’s a failure to re-start or the government makes it impossible to restart profitably? Just think of the ripple-effects of a restaurant told to have a third as many seats due to “social distancing.” What happens to revenue per foot? What happens to the amount they can pay in rent? What happens to the landlord who’s rent is cut by two-thirds? What about his ability or desire to pay his mortgage if the property is only worth a third as much? There will be ripple-on effects here that no one can predict. This is the first crisis that flooding the market with liquidity won’t solve. Printing money doesn’t cure the flu and new regulations likely make things worse.  I don’t believe anything I’ve said above is particularly revolutionary. They broke the economy to cure a flu that isn’t cured. Now, no one knows what to do financially or epidemiologically. At some point, we’ll come to the right solution, which is herd immunity.  Oddly, President Trump may turn out to be one of the great leaders in history, not because he understands biology (he doesn’t) or because he understands an effective way to generate herd immunity while protecting those at risk (details aren’t his strong suit), rather, he’s going to just pull the Band-Aid off and give global leaders the cover to let their people get the flu. Trump has always excelled at pointing out the obvious after the fact and taking credit for it, while ignoring everyone who disagreed along the way. This is his moment to “shine.” Left to chart his own path forward, we’d be over with COVID and back to work in a few weeks. He’s going to wake us all from our collective hypochondria and force us to accept that to go forward as a nation, some of us will not make it to the other side. Along the way, we’re going to have a “holy shit moment” when the virus makes a comeback and an even worse moment as we realize just how much the economy has degraded during the two months that we stayed home.  I bring all of these loose threads up because when I was buying “stuff” four weeks ago, it was a “gimme.” Many of the businesses I was buying were down by almost 80% from recent valuations that had seemed reasonable to me. Furthermore, they had minimal debt with termed out maturities. I just didn’t see how I could lose money at the valuations I was paying for “stuff.” There was a global margin call and phenomenal businesses were being given away. Once the forced selling ended, most equity indices bounced dramatically—the QQQ is even green on the year!! As a result, I’ve been a net seller for the past few days and have de-grossed my book quite a bit.  Remember March? Remember how frustrating it was to wake up and see the futures down-limit yet again? If there was anything you wanted to sell but couldn’t bring yourself to sell for a loss, now is likely a good time to get a bit lighter. Part of me says that “Project Zimbabwe” continues to send everything with a CUSIP parabolic while the other part of me says that you cannot fix a flu with money printing.  These two themes will battle for supremacy over the next few quarters, with “Project Zimbabwe” ultimately victorious, but that doesn’t mean we don’t have a whole lot of volatility along the way. While I think the market is going much higher, this is a decent time to stop, take a deep breath and see what you could do without in case the road higher isn’t linear—even Weimar had some nasty pullbacks along the way. On Monday March 23, I said, “I have the most exposure that I’ve had in years,” now after one of the wildest stock market rallies in history, my exposure is back to neutral. More importantly, I’ve pivoted my exposure strongly into those sectors that benefit from COVID-19 and money printing, namely tankers, natural gas and hard assets.  I never intended this site to be about making broad market calls and I don’t feel I have any particular skill in that regard. I got the sell something and the buy something timing perfectly right and the magnitude of the moves surprised even myself. I assume that the third call, this one where I say to cut back a bit, is the one I regret as asset prices power higher. That’s OK with me. I’m about taking low-risk shots on goal. I am stunned to see the stock market almost at prices that existed before they shut the global economy. While I am hopeful that they can figure out how to re-open the economy, no one knows what happens next. In my mind, we’re priced for perfection, but the economy is still broken. If the market is willing to pay me prices as if everything was perfect and I know it isn’t, why not take some exposure off?

There may be some good news on the coronavirus horizon, as Scripps Research reported it may have found COVID-19’s Achilles heel.  The research shows a specific area of the virus could be “targeted with drugs and other therapies, a finding that also could help with the development of a vaccine,” according to the San Diego Tribune.  The targeted area, according to biologist Ian Wilson, who led the scientific team, “is crucial to spreading the highly contagious virus, and … its composition suggests that it would be vulnerable to drugs.”  The discovery was published Friday in the journal Science and comes as scientists globally are working feverishly to find a vaccine or cure for the pandemic that has devastated global markets and caused more than 63,000 deaths worldwide.  An antibody taken from a SARS patient years earlier was used in the discovery, as researchers realized it had attached itself to a specific part of the virus, and were able to repeat the phenomenon with COVID-19, helping to identify a coronavirus weakness, according to the report.  “That high degree of similarity implies that the site has an important function that would be lost if it mutated significantly,” Scripps Research said in a statement Friday.  Sadly, the weak spot isn’t easy to find.  “We found that this (spot) is usually hidden inside the virus, and only exposed when that part of the virus changes its structure, as it would in natural infection,” Wilson’s colleague, Meng Yuan, said in a statement.  The institute is seeking the public’s help and is looking for COVID-19 survivors who would be willing to donate some of their blood, which would then be screened for potentially useful antibodies.

Every week in Johannesburg 60 volunteers meet to combat a crucial issue facing senior citizens of the South African Jewish community. Protecting the group has been top priority since the outbreak of the corona virus however these volunteers are not from the health care sector. Instead they are working on another front line, convening to pack and distribute food, for 130 elderly who are not able to shop and cook for themselves. They are part of the Union of Jewish Women’s, Kosher Mobile Meals project, that has been operating since the 1970’s and which has now been thrust onto the communal agenda due to the threat of the virus.  The declaration of a 21 day lock down brought mounting concerns that this vital nutritional life line would be cut off. Moving quickly Kosher Mobile Meals worked with the South African Jewish Board of Deputies to get their volunteers declared as an “essential service”. This gives them the freedom to move and operate in Johannesburg, keeping the supply lines open. This includes visits to places like Yoeville and Berea where a few Jewish residents still live amidst an area struggling with issues of urban decay.  The virus has brought other challenges to the work of the group. The social worker that normally visits recipients face to face, has had to connect via the phone. Masks and hand sanitiser have had to be issued to the teams and certain vulnerable volunteers have had to take a precautionary break from their activities. The project has also stepped up deliveries of non-perishables in addition to their normal food allocations.  The project faces an additional and unusual challenge. Members of the public often get Kosher Mobile Meals confused with the Meals on Wheels project, that is run by the local Methodist Church. This has resulted in many donations meant for the project going awry.  Despite the new challenges, Executive Director of the Union of Jewish Women, Cindy Kree is positive about the work that has been achieved. Kree commented that “Kosher Mobile Meals is proud to be seen as an essential service during this period of COVID-19. All Kosher Mobile Meals recipients will be able to eat Kosher and nutritious food during the lock down period, and Pesach.”  She was also full of praise for the people on that are helping to make sure that the work continues under the new stricter guidelines. “We thank our volunteers who are coming out and assisting with packing, and are obliging with the rules put out. Without them, and our incredibly generous community and donors, we would not be able to do this.”  Cindy did an interview about the work of the organisation at this time on community radio station on 101.9 ChaiFM on the New Blue Review:  The Kosher Mobile Meals project is fully funded and supported by the Union of Jewish Women.

General Motors is now remaking the iconic American SUV after a lengthy hiatus — but building parts of it in Mexico and elsewhere overseas.  “These are some of the staple brands and yes, they’re back,” said Williams, 49, who works at a GM plant in Romulus, Michigan, southwest of Detroit. “They’re just not being made in the U.S.”  The largest of six states voting Tuesday, Michigan could redefine a Democratic primary that has become a showdown between former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But many voters are already looking ahead to November and whether Trump can again win in the state that perhaps more than any other catapulted him into the White House in 2016.  Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at New Hope Baptist Church, Sunday, March 8, 2020, in Jackson, Miss. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)  For Sanders, the stakes could hardly be higher. He defeated Hillary Clinton in Michigan in 2016, emboldening his argument that he could win with a diverse coalition that drew well from young voters, working-class whites and African Americans. But it is the kind of victory he has not been able to replicate this time, and if he does not on Tuesday, any chances at the Democratic nomination may be greatly diminished.  Biden has been emphasizing the Obama administration’s bailout of the auto industry, which provided an economic lifeline for GM and Chrysler and federal loans for Ford, likely saving thousands of jobs. He is also counting on continued strong support among African American voters.  How Michigan votes will also be clarifying for November. Some see Sanders’ sweeping promises to cancel student debt and provide health care for all potentially energizing young voters but not older ones wary of his democratic socialist ideology. Centrist and safe, Biden could do exactly the opposite, though.  Others worry that both candidates are taking black Democrats for granted. All that may add up to neither being able to carry the state against Trump.  “There’s not a lot of energy, not enough energy, I would say, even for the primary,” said Michigan state Rep. Sherry Gay-Dagnogo, whose district includes a large swath of northwest Detroit. She said the Democratic Party continues to use the same playbook of waiting until the last minute to do intensive community outreach — which crippled it in 2016.  Indeed, major party turnout in Wayne County, which encompasses Detroit and is strongly African American, fell by more than 64,000 votes in 2016 as compared to 2012. That’s especially important since Trump leveled the Democrats’ famed “blue wall” with narrow wins in states that were supposed to comfortably go to Hillary Clinton: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, which he won by just 10,704 votes out more than 4.8 million cast.  Tuesday will be the first test of Democrats’ ability to take them back.  They already can point to hopeful signs. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who has endorsed Biden and been mentioned as a possible vice presidential pick, won in 2018, as fellow Democrat and Sen. Debbie Stabenow was cruising to re-election.  Veteran Michigan pollster Bernie Porn said the president remains unpopular with independents and Republican women, especially in the suburbs — though he said Trump’s standing has recovered some in the wake of impeachment.  “I think Trump is in trouble,” Porn said.  Flipping the state back could be built on gains in places like Grand Rapids, childhood home of Gerald Ford and long the epitome of country club Republicans, often most interested in fiscal conservatism but also closely watching social issues. It has begun moving to the left amid an influx of jobs bringing new residents from other parts of the state and the country, Porn said.  Sanders staged a rally Sunday in Grand Rapids and — vowing to grow the Democratic electorate by winning over young, minority and working-class voters — hit the University of Michigan and blue-collar Flint and Dearborn, home to a large concentration of Arab Americans. It is a promise he has made in other states during the primaries, but so far has largely failed to deliver.  “I am more than aware that Trump in 2016 won the state of Michigan by a small vote,” Sanders said. “I do believe the people of Michigan aren’t going to make that mistake again.”  Sanders canceled a planned trip to Mississippi to spend more time in the state this past weekend. But he has struggled to broaden his appeal with black voters, as evidenced by Biden’s wipe-out win in South Carolina and across many other Southern states on Super Tuesday.  Activist Monica Lewis-Patrick, president and CEO of We the People Detroit, said the eventual nominee will need a strong ground game in Detroit to prevent the same mistakes the party made in 2016, when the black community felt largely unseen and ignored. She has endorsed Sanders.  Citing the ongoing water crisis in Flint and Detroit’s aggressive water shutoff campaign that has disrupted service for 100,000-plus residential accounts across the city since 2014, Lewis-Patrick said the party needs to speak to issues that are impacting lives on a daily basis.  “We’ve told every candidate before we got down to the final two that we noticed in the debates when they came to Detroit that was missing from the conversation,” she said, referring to when the city hosted Democratic presidential debates last summer. “What we’re seeing is that many campaigns are treating black and brown communities as sort of a drive-by vote.”  Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks during a primary night election rally in Essex Junction, Vt., Tuesday, March 3, 2020. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)  Sanders has spoken to Flint’s water problems and the shutoff issue, asking with exasperation, “How is it possible” that people in parts of the state “don’t have water coming out of the tap?”  In an attempt to shore up its position no matter who wins the nomination, the Michigan Democratic Party has had staff on the ground since 2017 in “pivot” counties that supported Obama in 2012 but went to Trump last presidential cycle. It also has led campaigns highlighting Trump’s “broken promises” when it comes to issues like restoring lost manufacturing jobs.  Still, Gay-Dagnogo said that, though the state Democratic Party opened 15 offices around Michigan, ”it’s no secret” Trump’s reelection campaign has stood up its own operations in the same areas.  “I think sometimes we just wait for something magical to happen, opposed to making sure that there are financial resources in the community to get people out,” she said.  Trump, meanwhile, has visited Michigan several times as president and points to a strong national economy as proof he kept his kept his promises to restore the state’s lost jobs.  Manufacturing jobs in Michigan grew from 616,800 when Trump took office to 628,900 last December, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But some counties that Trump won have experienced job losses, and the state faces the prospect of further downturns as coronavirus reverberates through the economy.  While top union leaders have lined up to support either Biden or Sanders, many of their rank-and-file members continue to back Trump because of his views on social issues like guns and abortion.  “A number of union households who voted for Trump and voted against their own economic interests, I think, may do that again,” said Matt Vitiote, Democratic Party chairman in Monroe County near the Michigan-Ohio border, which twice supported Obama but voted for Trump in 2016.  Williams, who noted the Chevy Blazer’s international flavor, is backing Sanders and his promise to strengthen union membership nationwide. She concedes that Michigan’s economy has grown under Trump but hopes it won’t be enough for him to win the state again.  “I don’t see that there has been real growth in higher-paying jobs,” Williams said. “There have been jobs created, but they’re low-paying jobs and you’ve got to have two or three of them in order to raise your family.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 24, "positive": 41, "negative": 19, "sadness": 1, "disgust": 6, "joy": 5, "anger": 5, "surprise": 12, "fear": 3, "trust": 8}, "metadata": ["donald", "michigan", "joe", "biden", "trump", "presidential", "obama", "economic", "district", "wisconsin", "democrat", "recovered", "university", "canceled", "carolina", "ceo", "ongoing", "crisis", "treating", "economy", "labor", "coronavirus", "matt"]}, {"text": "The COVID-19 death toll on the African continent has surpassed 1,500 after the regional office of the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday announced 52 new deaths over the preceding 24 hour  MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 29th April, 2020) The COVID-19 death toll on the African continent has surpassed 1,500 after the regional office of the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday announced 52 new deaths over the preceding 24 hours.

Amid the reports, the president is alleged to have shouted down the phone at his campaign manager Brad Parscale, three sources “close to the matter” told CNN.  Mr Trump is said to have criticised Mr Parscale for the recent spate in falling poll numbers, and at one point threatened to take legal action. One Republican told CNN that: “He’s p** because he knows he messed up in those briefings.” Both the Trump campaign and the White House have not issued a comment to the news network in reply. It is said that the president and Mr Parscale managed to make amends later the same day, suggesting that the threatened legal action will not take place.  Trump is said to have had an angry phone call with his campaign manager.  A USA Today/Suffolk University poll shows that Mr Biden, former vice president to president Obama, is ahead of Mr Trump by six percentage points nationwide. It shows a swing in Mr Biden’s favour compared to previous polls – Mr Trump lead Biden 44 percent to 41 percent when the Democratic nomination was ongoing, USA Today reports. And a recent survey by Bladwin Wallace University in Ohio showed that Biden narrowly leads Trump by just one point – a swing in Biden’s direction after a four-point lead for Trump in March. The poll took a sample from registered voters in Ohio, who were sent an online form to fill out. READ MORE: 'Haven't seen him' Trump in MAJOR u-turn as US investigates Kim Jong  Joe Biden appears to be leading in many polls.  And Biden has widened his lead in states where he was already ahead. A Siena poll in showed that Biden’s lead over Trump in New York had grown from 25 points to 36 points between March and now. Mr Trump was reportedly briefed last Wednesday on how he was performing in the polls, which suggested defeat in key battleground states. Two advisors – Parscale and Republican Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel – suggested that the president be less combative in his daily press conferences. But Mr Trump responded by saying that it was restrictions on his ability to travel that was doing harm to his poll numbers, and not the briefings.

In perhaps the most striking, he asked a medical advisor whether injecting disinfectant could be used as a way of fighting the virus. He said: “And then I see the disinfectant. It knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that? By injection inside or almost a cleaning?”  Mr Trump then said that “it would be interesting to check that.” But the remarks have given rise to claims that the state of Maryland’s emergency hotline had received hundreds of calls seeking guidance over the president’s comments.

Small businesses across the nation are taking a beating due to federal guidelines on social distancing and local lockdown procedures to curb the spread of the virus.  “This is an unprecedented situation, where – for good reason – the government has instructed major parts of the economy to close down so that we can win this fight against this virus,” Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said in an interview with Fox Business.  Here’s all of our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak , which we will be updating every day.  While such measures are intended to help the country in the long term, many businesses are feeling the pain now, especially in the restaurant and hospitality industries.  Here’s how small businesses affected by the coronavirus can get assistance.   Banking and Credit-Card Programs  On March 9, the FDIC urged financial institutions to assist its customers who are dealing with the effects of the coronavirus. A slew of major banks and credit-card issuers announced steps they will take to support their customers.  Many banks said they will help on a case-by-case basis and to call the service number on the back of the issued credit or debit card.  Chase, CitiBank and SunTrust were more specific, announcing several means of assistance such as waiving early withdrawal and monthly service fees, providing loan payment relief or helping businesses create contingency plans.  The Penny Hoarder compiled a list of banks that announced coronavirus-related assistance.   Emergency Government Assistance  Three major initiatives aim to provide economic relief to individuals and businesses.  Families First Coronavirus Response Act  On March 18, President Donald Trump signed into law the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. Though aimed broadly at household assistance, the new law changes much for employers with less than 500 employees. The act provides tax credits for businesses to expand family medical leave and to grant their workers at least 14 days of paid sick leave amid the outbreak.  Businesses with 50 employers or fewer may qualify for a waiver if they can prove these requirements will cause additional “financial hardship.”  “This [law] will provide significant relief to small businesses that cannot afford the employee costs associated with coronavirus. [It] provides a dollar for dollar reimbursement for coronavirus related sick leave costs,” Treasury Secretary Mnuchin announced.  For cash-strapped businesses, the U.S. Treasury will allow them to use IRS deposited funds to cover the costs of paid leave and, in some cases, administer cash advances, Mnuchin said.  Deferred Tax Payments, Extended Filing Deadline  Through executive action, President Trump deferred federal tax payments until July 15, 2020 – up to $1 million for non-corporate filers (including the self-employed) and up to $10 million for corporate taxpayers.  “This deferment allows those who owe a payment to the IRS to defer the payment until July 15 without interest or penalties,” Mnuchin said.  According to the U.S. Treasury, the deferment will free up an estimated $300 billion.  On Friday, March 20, Mnuchin announced the filing deadline is also extended to July 15.  $1,200 Stimulus Checks Through the CARES Act  President Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act into law March 27. The sprawling $2 trillion package includes direct assistance to most Americans via a one-time $1,200 check, plus more money for parents with kids under 17. The funds will come automatically, and the extra cash is expected to spur economic activity.  See our Q&A for everything we know about the stimulus checks.  An additional $360 billion is earmarked for small businesses to encourage them to keep employees on the payroll and to beef up the SBA’s disaster relief loan programs.   Facebook Small Business Grants  Facebook pumped $100 million into a newly unveiled fund for small businesses that are reeling from COVID-19. Small businesses from more than 30 different countries will be eligible to apply for grants or ad credits through the initiative, dubbed Facebook Small Business Grants Program.  The funds may be used for:   Workforce investments.   Rent.   Advertising.   Operational expenses.  The social media giant has not yet released details on how to qualify or apply but will share updates “in the coming weeks.”  In the meantime, business owners can utilize Facebook’s new Business Resource Hub, which offers tips and tools to keep workers and customers up-to-date during the outbreak.  For more information, view all of our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak , which we will be updating every day.   SBA Disaster Loans  The first law in response to COVID-19, the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, supplied $20 million to the Small Business Administration so the agency can administer low-interest SBA disaster loans to small businesses impacted by the coronavirus. The CARES Act padded that sum with an extra $10 billion.  Loans up to $2 million are now available to small businesses and nonprofits in all 50 states and Wasington, D.C.  “These loans may be used to pay fixed debts, payroll, accounts payable and other bills that can’t be paid because of the disaster’s impact,” the terms state.  The interest rates for disaster loans are 3.75% for businesses and 2.75% for nonprofits.  The CARES Act also provides disaster loan advances up to $10,000 for small businesses experiencing a temporary loss of revenue due to the coronavirus. Funds are available in as little as three days of a successful application.  SBA loans and advances may be forgiven if the funds are used for costs related to payroll, health care, rent and utilities.  Qualifying organizations should apply online or reach out to the SBA for assistance at 1‐800‐659‐2955.   Other Local Resources  Small business funding is often coordinated at a local level, and community resources shouldn’t be overlooked.  Governors’ offices : Governors coordinate with the SBA to designate disaster areas. Their websites typically include updates and other resources for business owners.

Centers help entrepreneurs and small businesses with a variety of resources and will likely coordinate the SBA disaster loan program locally.  U.S. Chambers of Commerce: The U.S. Chamber represents more than 3 million businesses and is the largest lobbying organization in the country. Throughout the coronavirus outbreak, the Chamber has kept updates on how it’s affecting small businesses and, on several occasions, called on the government to enact specific policies to aid business owners.

Since Gov. Tony Evers declared a public health emergency March 12, the Wisconsin National Guard has completed a number of missions to support the state and the Wisconsin Department of Health Services.  On March 25, Wisconsin National Guard troops transported a load of donated personal protective equipment (PPE) to a warehouse facility for the state’s use. Approximately 15 troops remain on hand to assist with PPE handling and warehousing operations.  A team of six medics dispatched to a senior living facility in Grafton, Wisconsin, completed their three-day mission to augment staff there after a COVID-19 outbreak at the facility resulted in a temporary staffing shortage. That mission concluded late March 23.  Meanwhile a small team of Wisconsin National Guard planners and project managers is offering assistance to the Wisconsin Elections Commission to aid elections officials in planning for logistics considerations to help ensure the state can hold its upcoming election April 7. Among the considerations, the Guard may assist with procuring and distributing hand sanitizer, wipes, spray bottles and other needed supplies to polling sites to ensure the election can be held safely.  A group of 29 citizens returning from a cruise ship with confirmed COVID-19 cases returned to the Wisconsin National Guard’s Volk Combat Readiness Training Center in Camp Douglas, Wisconsin, where National Guard troops were waiting to transport them to their homes for self-quarantine. A second group of four additional passengers returned late March 20.  The Wisconsin National Guard continues to work hand-in-hand with its partners across state government to anticipate other potential requests for assistance. Many of the National Guard troops called to state active duty are medics or medical professionals, while many others are versed in decontamination processes. Guard personnel are actively training and preparing for a potential specimen collection mission that could be established at mobile testing sites around the state, should the state need that resource.  Second Lt. Arianna Schmitz of the Whitewater, Wisconsin-based 457th Chemical Company explained how service members were being trained to assist the public if needed.  “Today, we’ve been setting up getting our Soldiers trained,” Schmitz said. “So when it comes time, and we are with the public, we are ready to assist the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. We will be aiding in taking sampling and screenings of specimens of people that have been deemed a high risk. That way we can determine if they have tested positive for the Coronavirus or not.”  Pfc. Alex Spring, also a 457th Soldier said the Guard is honored to help in any way, and hopes the Guard’s presence is one that puts people at ease.  “We have a uniform people know and trust with information and we are actively trying to keep people safe throughout the state of Wisconsin,” he said.  A number of medical professionals are also on state active duty as ready resource of medical surge capacity, if needed.  Maj. Shawn Murphy, a Senior Physician Assistant with the Waukesha, Wisconsin-based 135th Area Support Medical Company, is confident in the flexibility the National Guard holds while giving aid to the citizens of Wisconsin.  “We are being prepared to answer the call from Wisconsin Emergency Management,” He said. “To fulfill any role we need to do in the National Guard.”  The Wisconsin Guard has also mobilized an array of logistics experts and planners to be in position to support the state with timely and efficient responses, as requested by the state.  “Serving our state and fellow citizens during times of emergency is one of our core missions in the Wisconsin National Guard,” said Maj. Gen. Paul Knapp, Wisconsin’s adjutant general. “We’re neighbors helping neighbors and will continue to assist the state in any way we can with this all-of-Wisconsin effort.”  Lt. Col. Paul Felician, the Battalion Commander for the 641st Troop Command, agreed, and said he believes there is no higher honor than serving the people of your community.  “To wear this uniform is an honor and to be called upon to serve within the community is perhaps the highest mark of trust we could be given,” he said. “I know that whatever comes we are ready to execute the mission successfully”  The vast majority of Wisconsin National Guard members are Citizen Soldiers and Airmen who hold civilian occupations in their communities as well.

The International Olympic Committee announced Tuesday the 2020 Summer Olympics scheduled for July in Tokyo, Japan, would be postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic that is shutting down daily life around the globe, endangering public health and altering training schedules.  The IOC said the Tokyo Games “must be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020, but not later than summer 2021, to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games and the international community.”  USA Women's National Team member Monica Abbott pitches for the USA. (Photo: USA Softball)  Abbott, 34, was part of the last softball team to appear in the Olympics in 2008, capturing a silver medal before the lengthy hiatus. The sport is not guaranteed to return after Tokyo until the 2028 Games in Los Angeles at the earliest. The Paris Organizing Committee did not include the sport on the Olympic program for the 2024 Games.  \"I am glad that they finally made a decision. I think that was the right decision for all athletes all over the world,” Abbott said. “It's important for athletes all over the world to have a level playing field and have equal time to be able to train.\"  The 6-foot-3 Abbott played for the Lady Vols from 2004-07 and had her No. 7 jersey retired by UT. She had a 189-34 record with a 0.79 ERA, including 23 no-hitters and six perfect games.  From swimmers to sprinters to soccer players, Abbott is one of several athletes with Tennessee ties impacted by the Olympic postponement. The swimmers and track and field athletes were still trying to qualify for the games by preparing for the trials.  But their training had been disrupted by the global health crisis, with facilities closing around the country to try to prevent the spread of the virus.  Christian Coleman and Justin Gatlin are the two fastest men in the world and were preparing for the Olympic Trials. Coleman, the reigning 100-meter world champion, has been working out alone in his hometown of Atlanta while living with his parents during the pandemic.  Coleman, 24, told Reuters that he has been hopping a fence to use the track at a local high school.

(Photo: Calvin Mattheis/News Sentinel)  “I hope they postpone it to next year and give everybody a clean slate and do it right,” Coleman said a day before the IOC announcement was made. “Even if in four months this was to pass by, I don’t think a lot of people would feel comfortable (with) everybody pounding into an Olympic village.”  The 38-year-old Gatlin, who won gold in the 100 at the 2004 Athens Games, was planning to have Tokyo be his final meet as a competitive sprinter.  “I want to leave on an Olympic cycle,” Gatlin told BBC journalist Ade Adedoyin at the 2019 IAAF Diamond League meet in Switzerland. “My goal is to get to 2020 and get on top of that podium. If it ends well, if it doesn’t, I want to be able to leave my spikes on the track and say I am done.”  Among the more than 20 swimmers with UT connections trying to qualify for Tokyo, Erika Brown, Molly Hannis and Meghan Small had the strongest chances for Team USA. Tess Cieplucha (Canada), Michael Houlie (South Africa), Matt Wade (Spain) and Kayky Mota (Brazil) also were hoping to represent their respective countries.  UT graduate Hannah Wilkinson was expected to play for New Zealand in women’s soccer for the third straight Olympics.  Abbott remains eager to represent Team USA no matter how long the postponement lasts. She was happy to see the Olympics postponed rather than canceled to give herself and softball another chance to compete on the world’s stage.  “The biggest thing right now is just to stop the coronavirus and make sure people stay home and stay healthy and flatten the curve,” Abbott said. “Getting the world healthy is the first step.\"  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 21, "positive": 12, "negative": 5, "disgust": 1, "joy": 2, "surprise": 2, "fear": 2, "trust": 6}, "metadata": ["olympics", "postponed", "coronavirus", "pandemic", "los", "angeles", "jersey", "impacted", "global", "reuters", "diamond", "league", "matt", "canceled"]}, {"text": "COVID-19 in Sampson: A timeline *Total positive patients based on announcements made by the County of Sampson and the Sampson County Health Department.

The Sampson County Health Department on Monday reported 15 new cases, tacking on to the last report of 81 on Friday. The first death came on Saturday, listed as being “from complications to the virus.” The person’s name was not disclosed.  “The individual was between the age of 50-55 with underlying medical conditions,” the county said in a statement. “To protect the family’s privacy, no further information will be released.”  “It is with deep regret that we have lost a citizen of our county due to COVID-19. Our thoughts and condolences are with the loved ones of this individual in this most difficult time” said Wanda Robinson, Sampson County Health Director.  According to statistics from the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) on Monday, the 50-64 age group is the second most-inflicted by COVID-19.  In terms of laboratory-confirmed cases, the 25-49 age group accounts for the majority of the state’s cases, at 41 percent, while the 50-64 age group accounts for 26 percent and the 65-plus category makes up 23 percent, according to the agency. Just 10 percent of cases are those 24 years and younger, with 7 percent of those being in the 18-24 age group, the NCDHHS noted.  In terms of COVID-19 deaths in North Carolina, to date, the 65-plus group accounts for 87 percent of all COVID-19 deaths in the state, according to NCDHHS figures. There have been none among patients 24 and younger, while the 25-49 group accounts for just 4 percent of the state’s deaths. The 50-64 group makes up the remaining 9 percent, the agency reported.  As of Monday, there had been 416 tests performed for COVID-19 in Sampson, resulting in 284 negatives to go with the 96 positive tests. Of those positive patients, 17 have since recovered, according to county officials, who noted 36 additional tests pending as of Monday.  An active outbreak at Smithfield Packing Company in Clinton has accounted for 21 confirmed cases. Some of those patients reside in other counties and are not counted in the total cases for Sampson.  The Health Department is continuing to work with Smithfield Foods representatives in an effort to protect the health of their employees. The Clinton plant is still in operation and no additional cases from Smithfield have been reported since Thursday.  Due to the increasing number of outbreaks within meat processing plants, the NCDHHS will be posting the facility name, the county, the number of cases and the number of deaths associated with each meat processing facility on its website, at ncdhhs.gov, Sampson County officials stated.  That information had not been posted as of Monday.  Sampson County health officials are working to identify close contacts of those infected, which the Centers for Disease Control defines as being within approximately 6 feet of a person with a COVID-19 infection for a prolonged period of time. Based on information provided by the individuals, county health officials will assess risks of exposure, and determine which, if any, additional measures are needed such as quarantine or testing.  With the increase in total cases, local officials reminded residents that if they think they have the coronavirus, they should call their local health care provider so symptoms can be evaluated and the best course of action provided. Those with fevers of 100.4 or higher, cough or shortness of breath should stay home.  On Monday, Sampson County health officials again urged residents to following several simple measures, including social distancing (maintaining 6 feet from others), avoiding touching the face, wearing protective face covering when in public, covering coughs, washing hands and disinfecting surfaces frequently.  As of Monday, North Carolina had 11,848 confirmed COVID-19 cases covering 99 of 100 counties, according to the NC Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS). There were 430 deaths and 498 hospitalized due to COVID-19. Statewide, there had been 146,439 COVID-19 tests completed as of Monday morning, the agency reported.  NC Governor Roy Cooper has urged residents to remain vigilant amid the pandemic.  A Stay-At-Home order from Cooper is currently in place until this Friday, May 8. Cooper has outlined a multi-phase plan whereby restrictions would begin to be eased. He is expected to further outline what Phase I will entail on Wednesday.   Cooper signs relief bills  Cooper signed two bills Monday to provide more than $1.5 billion for COVID-19 relief. Funds will be used to meet needs related to education, health care, health disparities, public safety and small businesses.  Some of the funds will be for increasing COVID-19 testing and personal protective equipment for health care workers. Health disparities funds will specifically address areas and populations being more affected by COVID-19. Education funds will be aimed at feeding children, providing summer programs and computers for students who need them.  “I am signing into law two critical relief bills that will provide assistance to families, schools, hospitals and small businesses as our state battles COVID-19,” Cooper stated. “There is more work ahead of us, and I hope the spirit of consensus behind these bills will continue.”  The Governor was joined by House Speaker Tim Moore, Democratic House Leader Darren Jackson, Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger and Democratic Senate Leader Dan Blue.  “The General Assembly crafted a bipartisan COVID-19 relief package that puts North Carolina on the right path to recovery. Governor Cooper’s signature on these bills sends a signal to our citizens that our state is moving past this crisis and that action is being taken to address their concerns,” said Berger.  “I am proud of the work that we have done in the Senate to address the pressing needs in our state,” Blue added. “I look forward to working with Senator Berger on the next COVID-19 relief package so that we can build a stronger, more resilient for all North Carolinians.”  The relief package, which was passed unanimously, includes almost $1.6 billion in relief measures for critical expenditures related to public health and safety, educational needs, small business assistance, and continuity of state government operations. Of this amount, $1.4 billion has been appropriated and $150 million is set aside in a reserve fund for future local government needs.  The package also contains key policy changes to support North Carolinians as the state battles COVID-19.   https://www.clintonnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/web1_virus-1.jpg https://www.clintonnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/web1_COVID-1.jpg  County’s COVID-19 cases increase by 15, up to 96  By Chris Berendt [email protected]  COVID-19 in Sampson: A timeline *Total positive patients based on announcements made by the County of Sampson and the Sampson County Health Department.

The alleged scam was discovered after the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West (SEIU), a union representing California health care workers, many of whom are on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, publicly announced last month it had located 39 million critically needed N95 masks from a supplier, and would be connecting local governments and hospital officials seeking to purchase masks for their employees.The SEIU's announcement caught the attention of a Justice Department task force working to counter the hoarding of critical supplies during the pandemic, and it was interested in learning more about the individual attempting to sell such a large cache of critically-needed items.In addition to identifying potential scams, the federal task force also wanted to know whether the material fell under the category of critical medical items that could be seized under the Defense Production Act, according to a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Western District of Pennsylvania.According to the U.S. attorney running the investigation, one aspect of the claim that raised eyebrows at the DOJ was the fact 3M produced only 20 million N95 masks in all of 2019, yet the union's supplier was purportedly in possession of 39 million masks from that manufacturer.A spokesman for the union told CNN they were contacted by law enforcement after issuing their news release and provided the Justice Department with the supplier's information.Brady told CNN the supplier was identified as a man in Pennsylvania who claimed he was merely a middleman working with two foreign companies — a broker in Australia and a supplier in Kuwait — which are now both under federal investigation.The Pennsylvania supplier is cooperating with law enforcement and is not believed to have been knowingly involved in the alleged criminal activity.Brady noted the SEIU and 3M — which was reported to be the maker of the alleged N95 masks — have also assisted authorities.Following the original SEIU announcement, Kaiser Permanente, one of the nation's largest non-profit health care systems, placed an order for approximately 6 million masks; however, the order was canceled after officials at Kaiser became suspicious of the deal.Related video: Company makes reusable N95 masks\"Despite multiple requests, the supplier repeatedly failed to provide reliable information about where we could verify and inspect the shipment,\" Kaiser spokesman Marc Brown told CNN. \"Because the supplier could not confirm the existence of the shipment, we withdrew from the arrangement and no money ever changed hands. We learned shortly afterward that the supplier never had possession of the masks.\"N95 masks are currently among the most sought-after and scarce pieces of personal protective equipment for health care workers treating the thousands of U.S. victims of the novel coronavirus.\"The health care systems and first responders are so desperate, they're willing to pay whatever it takes to keep their personnel safe,\" Brady noted.For their part, the two unidentified foreign entities targeted by investigators face possible wire fraud and other federal charges. A wire fraud conviction typically carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. However, that number increases to 30 years in prison for violations associated with a presidentially declared emergency.While the penalties are steep, Brady indicated the immediate goal of the Justice Department is to protect hospitals and their workers at the forefront of the coronavirus battle.\"We're trying to first disrupt the fraud as we identify it, and then start the traditional investigations going forward,\" he said. \"But in the near term, what we want to do is disrupt it to make sure people in the U.S. aren't victimized.\"For those contemplating profiting from scams during the pandemic, Brady offered a stark warning.\"The Department of Justice has a long memory,\" he said. \"If you have victimized and defrauded people, especially in the time of a national crisis, be sure that at some point in the near future, someone will be knocking on your door.\"  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 13, "positive": 25, "negative": 17, "disgust": 1, "anger": 20, "surprise": 1, "fear": 3, "trust": 11}, "metadata": ["respirator", "masks", "criminal", "united", "district", "coronavirus", "los", "angeles", "healthcare", "california", "hospital", "spokesperson", "spokesman", "australia", "kuwait", "canceled", "protective", "treating", "victims"]}, {"text": "WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) — Members of Congress want answers so Americans can prepare themselves adequately for the coronavirus. On Tuesday, they had their chance to hear from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  “Do you have enough resources?” Connecticut Congresswoman Rose DeLauro asked.  The head of the CDC met with members of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Tuesday to help the lawmakers better understand the situation around COVID-19, more commonly known as the novel coronavirus.  “Ninety-nine percent of the cases that occurred last night, occurred outside of China. This isn’t China. Right now, the epicenter, the new China, is Europe,” CDC Director Robert Redfield said.  Redfield says for the average healthy American, simply staying home and drinking fluids will be enough treatment. For more serious cases, medical experts are testing a new drug.  “We’re going to know probably by April whether that drug works or not, and that’s important because that’s a drug that can save lives, if it works,” Redfield said.  The CDC says the country’s primary focus is shifting from stopping the virus through quarantine to slowing its spread through broader mitigation tactics.  But some representatives want to see more of those efforts.  “We are behind the curve in testing, when South Korea can test 10,000 people in a day,” DeLauro said.  DeLauro and Massachusetts Congresswoman Katherine Clark expressed concern about the low level of testing.  “We have been warned about moving from containment to mitigation and I think the lack of testing that was done has hastened our move out of containment phase into mitigation,” Clark said.  The CDC says nearly 5,000 people have been tested through public labs and they are now working on a system to monitor the results from private labs, as well.

David Cruz, 28, was charged with murder for allegedly shooting Christian Tristan, 27, to death at 7400 Satsuma on Aug. 5, 2019.  A Harris County judge released a murder suspect on a pretrial bond Thursday, after the man requested a bail reduction, saying he feared that COVID-19 would strike the county lockup and “spread like wildfire.”  David Cruz, 29, was detained in connection with his friend’s death because he couldn’t afford a $60,000 bond. He asked Judge DaSean Jones to lower his bond to $30,000 and impose electronic monitoring and pretrial supervision. His lawyer stated in court documents Monday that COVID-19 “is certainly going to strike the Harris County jail population and spread like wildfire among inmates.” If Cruz were released, the lawyer said, Cruz would live with his parents and work as an estimator at the family’s lamination business.  Cruz was arrested in what he told relatives was the accidental shooting of his friend in August.  The judge did not reduce the bond as Cruz had requested, but let him go without paying his original $60,000 bond upfront, instead he asked for a 3.5 percent payment to pretrial services. If he violates the terms of release, he would owe the full amount and could be returned to jail.  Cruz's lawyer, David Cunningham, declined to comment.  Joe Gamaldi, of the Houston Police Officers’ Union, called the ruling “completely irresponsible and ridiculous.”  “Certainly we understand the risk of anyone catching COVID-19, however we have to balance these decisions about letting a suspected murderer out on PR bonds with the risk that poses to the public and whether or not this person is going to show up to court,” Gamaldi said. “This is someone who is facing a murder charge and the only thing that is guaranteeing his appearance in court is a signature on a piece of paper — what happens if this person signs a PR bond and takes off for Mexico?”  CORONAVIRUS UPDATES: Stay informed with accurate reporting you can trust  Jones, who presides in the 180th district court, has been at the forefront on bond reform among the felony judges. He declined to speak about the particulars of the Cruz case, but said the friction over such bond rulings stems from the fact that most people don’t understand that poverty is not a lawful reason to keep people locked up. It’s not his job to presume by default that defendants are guilty and should be detained, he said.  The judge mentioned the 8th Amendment prohibition against excessive bail and fines and cruel and unusual punishments. He said you can’t keep someone “an eternity,” citing a portion of the Texas constitution that states says you can hold someone with a criminal history for 60 days without bond, but then you must set a bond.  “They don’t realize that the elements that we’re supposed to look at do not include the person being poor,” he said. “No judge should be using jail as a punitive effort before a person has plead or been found guilty.”  Investigators said at the time of Cruz’s arrest in August that the defendant said he accidentally killed his friend. Cruz faces a first-degree felony murder in the fatal shooting of Christian Tristan in southeast Houston. Cruz had told three family members he accidentally shot his 27-year-old friend and then tossed the gun over a bridge on Navigation, according to police.  Cruz has a prior felony conviction for failing to stop and render aid in a 2011 hit and run.   gabrielle.banks@chron.com  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 4, "positive": 16, "negative": 11, "disgust": 2, "joy": 3, "anger": 29, "surprise": 2, "fear": 8, "trust": 6}, "metadata": ["deadly", "requested", "feared", "monitoring", "joe", "houston", "signature", "coronavirus", "reporting", "district", "texas", "criminal", "plead"]}, {"text": "HARRISBURG (Newsradio 1020 KDKA) - The total number of positive COVID-19 cases in Pennsylvania has jumped to 185 after 52 new cases have been confirmed on Thursday.

The Jakarta administration, West Java and Banten must be united in implementing the policies,” Ridwan said on his official Facebook account.  “Should [the PSBB request] for the five regions be approved by the Health Minister, we would sync up our policies to strengthen and protect one another.”  Banten Governor Wahidin Halim also said that Tangerang regency, Tangerang municipality and South Tangerang municipality — three satellite cities under the Banten administrative region — would request PSBB status from Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto.  He urged the relevant mayors and regents to coordinate their policies with Jakarta, having agreed that Greater Jakarta as a whole should implement such measures in lockstep.  The Jakarta administration is set to tighten measures to restrict people’s movements beginning on Friday, in accordance with the PSBB status. In the absence of a special regulation that has yet to be signed as of the time of writing, Anies has shed some light on some of the key provisions.  Starting on Friday, gatherings of more than five people will be prohibited, public transportation services will halve their normal passenger capacity and limit operations from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.  The governor assured that private vehicles could still enter Jakarta, but an undetermined limit will be imposed on the number of passengers allowed in each vehicle.  Furthermore, eight essential industry sectors will remain fully operational to cater to the everyday needs of the public for as long as the emergency status is in place. This includes companies and organizations in the health, food and beverages, energy, communications, finances, logistics, retail and strategic sectors in the capital.  In addition, non-government organizations that manage relief operations related to ongoing mitigation efforts will also be allowed to carry on with their activities.  The PSBB status in Jakarta will be effective until April 24 — the provisional date for the start of the Muslim fasting month — but can be extended should the coronavirus continue to spread.  Several regional leaders of Greater Jakarta, including South Tangerang Deputy Mayor Benyamin Davnie, Bogor Deputy Mayor Dedie A. Rachim and Bekasi Mayor Rahmat Effendi, told The Jakarta Post they were preparing to fulfill the provisions required to warrant a PSBB status from the central government.  Neither has confirmed the kind of measures that would be applied in their respective regions, but they have called on their residents not to go to the capital city, especially after the PSBB status kicks in.  On Wednesday evening, Anies said he had maintained communication with the governors of West Java and Banten, as well as the regional leaders of the satellite cities, after a teleconference meeting to discuss coordination of the PSBB status in Greater Jakarta.  “It has become the epicenter [of the disease outbreak], so we require synchronized measures. What we [the Jakarta administration] have done will be made available as a reference,” he said in a press conference.  Anies also said he was waiting to sign the forthcoming gubernatorial decree formalizing the new quarantine status, pending a central government decision on provisions for app-based ride-hailing services.  Health Ministerial Decree No. 9/2020 stipulates that app-based ride-hailing services may only transport goods and are prohibited from transporting people.  Meanwhile, epidemiologist Pandu Riono of the University of Indonesia told the Post that any measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the capital would only be effective if applied equally to the rest of Greater Jakarta.  “[COVID-19] is centered in Greater Jakarta due to the mobility of its people, so measures taken should be in lockstep with one another,” Pandu told the Post on Tuesday.  The extent of implementing large-scale social restrictions could vary depending on each region's capabilities, but Pandu suggested that it should gradually intensify over time.  “Each region may implement measures based on their [resources] and transmission rate and in a gradual manner, but they should be done in concert because our country has refused to impose a full lockdown,” he said.  While Greater Jakarta scrambles to impose large-scale social restriction measures, considered by some observers as a de facto partial lockdown, other regions such as Sorong and Fakfak in West Papua, as well as Mimika in Papua province, have also requested the PSBB status, said Achmad Yurianto, the Health Ministry’s spokesperson for the COVID-19 response team.

Mr Graham - who has a long history of anti-LGBTQ beliefs - makes all volunteers agree to a Statement of Faith which includes the line 'marriage is exclusively the union of one genetic male and one genetic female'.  However, Graham has since posted in a lengthy Facebook message about how he has been harassed by 'elected officials and others' in New York.  'While so many have expressed their appreciation and support, sadly some New York officials and a special interest group have expressed concerns or outright opposition to the presence of Samaritan's Purse and our field hospital in Central Park. They include: Eight Democratic members of New York's Congressional delegation in Washington, D.C., The New York City Commission on Human Rights, The Reclaim Pride Coalition,' Graham alleged.  Franklin Graham is the evangelical pastor whose group Samaritan's Purse is running a field hospital in New York's Central Park which was set up at the end of March  Franklin Graham says he is being harassed for insisting his hospital workers are opposed to gay marriage before coming to work at the field hospital  'While our Scriptural belief in marriage between a man and a woman seems particularly offensive to representatives of these three groups, we don't believe this is the time or place to wage this debate. Samaritan's Purse is a decidedly Christian private relief organization, funded almost entirely by individuals around the world who share our passion for providing aid to victims of war, disease, disaster, poverty, famine and persecution—and doing so in Jesus' Name,' the pastor continued.  'It seems tone-deaf to be attacking our religious conviction about marriage at the very moment thousands of New Yorkers are fighting for their lives and dozens of Samaritan's Purse workers are placing their lives at risk to provide critical medical care.'  'If any of these groups had funded and erected their own emergency field hospitals to serve COVID-19 patients in Central Park, we would join what we believe would be most New Yorkers—and Americans—in applauding and praying for them, not harassing them.  Last month, while setting up the temporary structure, in an attempt to allay fears because of the charity's anti-gay stance, Samaritan's Purse told state lawmakers that they would require those working at the hospital to sign an additional second pledge vowing not to discriminate against patients according to the New York Times.  The hospital has treated 119 patients so far. The facility, run by Christian humanitarian group Samaritan's Purse, has just over 70 medics and can take 10 intensive care patients  In a lengthy post on Facebook, Graham justified his group's views on same-sex marriage  Nonetheless, Graham justified his position by saying the group had a right to 'lawfully hire staff who share our Christian beliefs' because it is a religious charity.  The hospital consists of 14 tents with room for 68 beds, staffed by a team of more than 70 doctors, nurses and other medical personnel and relief specialists.  There are also 10 ICU beds equipped with ventilators. The hospital has admitted 119 patients during their first two weeks of operation.  Last week, activist William Talen - best known for his satirical character Reverend Billy - was arrested at the hospital and escorted away by six police officers, one clutching what is believed to be Talen's rainbow flag.  As he was being escorted away, the 69-year-old shouted: 'They have no business being in New York City. They are the virus.'  Talen allegedly jumped the perimeter of the hospital and planted a flag on the grounds before he was arrested.  Samaritan's Purse COVID Response team lead Dr Elliott Tenpenny said: 'We're taking more patients all the time to help the people in New York City'  Last month, the makeshift field hospital was constructed in Central Park in just 48 hours to take the pressure off overwhelmed hospitals in the city.  Samaritan's Purse COVID Response team lead Dr Elliott Tenpenny told MSNBC: 'We're taking more patients all the time to help the people in New York City.  'In partnership with Mount Sinai, we're accepting patients and each day a certain number come through and we receive them throughout the day.  He added: 'The challenge is those two hospitals [Mount Sinai hospitals in Brooklyn and Queens], those two boroughs, are really the ones that have been hit the hardest early on in this pandemic in New York City.  Central Park hospital has been taking in patients from the hardest-hit boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens  'We've been able to serve a great function here by offloading them and allowing them to treat more people.  'This virus doesn't just attack older Americans. There is greater risk for severe cases.  'This virus doesn't care who you are. It doesn't care how old you are. It's attacking people of all ages.'

Germany’s relatively low mortality rate continues to intrigue experts as Covid-19 spreads across Europe, with some questioning the methodology behind its data gathering while others argue the country’s high testing rates allow a more accurate approximation of the threat posed by the novel coronavirus.  While the pandemic has hit Germany with full force, with Johns Hopkins University noting 22,364 confirmed infections by Sunday morning, only 84 people are so far reported to have died.  This means Germany currently has the lowest mortality rate of the 10 countries most severely hit by the pandemic: 0.3% compared with 9% in Italy and 4.6% in the UK.  The contrast with Italy is especially surprising because the two countries have the highest percentage of citizens aged 65 or over in Europe. If anything, the Bloomberg Global Health Index would suggest Italians have a healthier lifestyle than Germans.  German politicians and senior health officials have been reluctant to comment on the low mortality rate while the situation is developing so rapidly. Lothar Wieler, the president of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the government’s central public health body, has said he does not expect there to be a significant difference in mortality rates between Italy and Germany in the long run.

This means that the state is releasing about 36 inmates every day with no end in sight, all in an effort to empty jails to prevent the spread of the coronavirus,” Breitbart News reported.  In 2018, Christie was convicted of repeatedly raping a 12-year-old boy.  Parris was arrested less than two months ago and charged with raping and sexually assaulting two teenage girls.  Related: California releases ‘high risk’ sex offenders over coronavirus fears, May 1, 2020  According to the charges, Parris had been working as a teaching assistant at Southeastern Regional Vocational Technical High School when he contacted a 15-year-old student through Instagram. The two met at a local cemetery, according to police, and Parris allegedly attempted to kiss her and touch her breast. The victim said Parris gave her a bag with a sex toy in it before she fled.  More than a week later, police said Parris threatened and forced the girl to perform oral sex on him in the middle of a school day inside a closet.  A second victim told police that Parris had similarly contacted her through Instagram. When the two met in person, police said Parris forced the girl to perform oral sex on him and threatened the victim’s family. A day later, police said Parris forced the girl to get undressed in his car before driving to a location where he allegedly sexually assaulted her.  Parris had already pleaded not guilty to charges of aggravated statutory rape, rape of a child with force, and kidnapping of a child.  Boston Police Commissioner William Gross said that violent offenders should not be released from prison regardless of the health risks posed by staying incarcerated.  “People who have been locked up for violent offenses and carrying a firearm should not be released on personals, and I could care less if they get sick in jail or not,” Gross said. “They are a danger to the community, and they’re sending the wrong mentality.”  In Florida, an inmate who was released because of coronavirus concerns is now back in prison and facing murder charges, police said.  Joseph Edward Williams, 26, was first arrested on March 13 for allegedly possessing heroin, a third-degree felony, and drug paraphernalia, a first-degree misdemeanor, Hillsborough County police said. He was released on March 19 before his trial and after an order instructed Hillsborough County to release nonviolent, low-level offenders to avoid a coronavirus outbreak in the detention centers.  Williams was arrested again for allegedly taking part in a March 20 homicide in Tampa and now faces a second-degree murder charge, the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office said. Williams is now back in custody with no bond.  Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said Williams “took advantage of this health emergency to commit crimes” and called on the state attorney to prosecute him “to the fullest extent of the law.”  In California, a man released from jail over coronavirus concerns allegedly committed a carjacking — 40 minutes after being released.  Rocky Lee Music, 32, was arrested for committing a carjacking after he was released from Santa Rita jail in California on April 19. Music had first been arrested hours earlier for car theft, the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office reported. He was released from jail on zero bail.  Owen Aguilar, 27, was charged with setting nine fires less than a week after his release from the Fresno County Jail.  Aguilar had been facing a charge of felony animal cruelty when he was released from jail on April 10, the Fresno County district attorney’s office said.  Music and Aguilar were released under an April 13 emergency order by the state Judicial Council which cut bail to zero for those charged with low-level offenses. The order aimed to combat the potential spread of the coronavirus within packed lockups, the Judicial Council said.  The judicial order is expected to continue for 90 days after Gov. Gavin Newsom his statewide stay-at-home order.

ROME, Italy — It was the biggest soccer game in Atalanta's history and a third of Bergamo's population made the short trip to Milan's famed San Siro Stadium.  Nearly 2,500 fans of visiting Spanish club Valencia also traveled to that Champions League match.  More than a month later, experts are pointing to the Feb. 19 game as one of the biggest reasons why Bergamo has become one of the epicenters of the coronavirus pandemic — a \"biological bomb\" was the way one respiratory specialist put it — and why 35% of Valencia's team became infected.  The match, which local media have dubbed \"Game Zero,\" was held two days before the first case of locally transmitted COVID-19 was confirmed in Italy.  \"We were mid-February so we didn't have the circumstances of what was happening,\" Bergamo Mayor Giorgio Gori said this week during a live Facebook chat with the Foreign Press Association in Rome. \"If it's true what they're saying that the virus was already circulating in Europe in January, then it's very probable that 40,000 Bergamaschi in the stands of San Siro, all together, exchanged the virus between them. As is possible that so many Bergamaschi that night got together in houses, bars to watch the match and did the same.  \"Unfortunately, we couldn't have known. No one knew the virus was already here,\" the mayor added. \"It was inevitable.\"  Less than a week after the game, the first cases were reported in the province of Bergamo.  At about the same time in Valencia, a journalist who traveled to the match became the second person infected in the region, and it didn't take long before people who were in contact with him also had the virus, as did Valencia fans who were at the game.  While Atalanta announced its first positive case Tuesday for goalkeeper Marco Sportiello, Valencia said more than a third of its squad got infected, \"despite the strict measures adopted by the club\" after the match in Milan.  As of Tuesday, nearly 7,000 people in the province of Bergamo had tested positive for COVID-19 and more than 1,000 people had died from the virus — making Bergamo the most deadly province in all of Italy for the pandemic. The Valencia region had more than 2,600 people infected.  Luca Lorini, the head of the intensive care unit at the Pope John XXIII hospital in Bergamo, currently has 88 patients under his care with the coronavirus; not including many more in other parts of the hospital.  \"I'm sure that 40,000 people hugging and kissing each other while standing a centimeter apart — four times, because Atalanta scored four goals (the final result was 4-1) — was definitely a huge accelerator for contagion,\" Lorini told The Associated Press on Wednesday.  \"Right now we're at war. When peace time comes, I can assure you we will go and see how many of the 40,000 people who went to the game became infected,\" Lorini added. \"Right now we have other priorities.\"  Silvio Brusaferro, the head of Italy's Superior Institute of Health, said over the weekend at the nightly nationally televised briefing by the civil protection agency that the game was \"one of the hypotheses\" being evaluated as a source of the crisis in Bergamo.  \"It's certainly an analysis that can be made,\" Brusaferro said.  By last week, Bergamo's cemetery became so overwhelmed by the number of dead that military trucks began transporting bodies to a neighboring region for cremation.  Italy remained the European country with the most cases, nearly 70,000, and with almost 7,000 deaths — the most worldwide and more than twice as many as China.  Spain is the next country in Europe with the most cases, nearly 48,000, and it has surpassed China in the number of deaths with more than 3,400.  More than 435,000 people worldwide have been infected and the number of dead closed in on 20,000, according to the running count kept by Johns Hopkins University. Overall, more than 100,000 have recovered.  For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.  The official attendance for the Feb. 19 game was 45,792 — a \"home\" record for Atalanta, a small club making its debut in Europe's top club competition.  Atalanta captain Alejandro \"Papu\" Gómez told Argentine daily Olé it was \"terrible\" to have played that game.  \"It's a city of 120,000 people and that day (40,000) went to the San Siro,\" the Argentine said. \"It was a historic match for Atalanta, something unique. To give you an idea, my wife took three hours to get to Milan, when that trip normally takes 40 minutes.\"  The game was played in Milan because Atalanta's stadium in Bergamo didn't meet the requirements set by European soccer governing body UEFA.  Before the match, Valencia fans freely roamed around Milan and gathered at some of the city's plazas, including the Piazza del Duomo, drinking and chanting team songs.  Looking back, the conditions for virus contagion were high, with thousands of people gathering without much concern — at a time when the outbreak in Europe wasn't yet known — and then traveling back home. Nearly 30 busloads of fans made the 60-kilometer (37-mile) trip from Bergamo to Milan.  The evening before the match, there was no social distancing as officials from both clubs mingled and exchanged gifts and handshakes at a gala dinner offered by Atalanta.  \"I have heard a lot (of theories), I'll say mine: Feb. 19, 40,000 Bergamaschi went to San Siro for Atalanta-Valencia,\" Fabiano di Marco, the chief pneumologist at the hospital in Bergamo, told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. \"In buses, cars, trains. A biological bomb, unfortunately.\"  Valencia defender Ezequiel Garay was the first Spanish league player to test positive for COVID-19. The team played a Spanish league game against Alavés about two weeks after the game in Milan, and later Alavés reported that 15 people in the club were infected, though it did not say the cases were directly related to the match against Valencia.  Italian soccer players' association president Damiano Tommasi believes sports authorities should look long and hard at the Atalanta match before restarting leagues.  \"Look at what's happening in China, where players are testing positive for the coronavirus now — despite all the safety rules and precautions being taken,\" Tommasi told the AP, referring to a recent positive test for former Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini with Chinese club Shandong Lunen.  Fellaini's positive test was alarming because, while the outbreak began spreading in China, the virus has reportedly been receding there.  \"It's not going to be enough to just test the athletes,\" Tommasi added. \"The entire setting needs to be safe. Because if one team is stuck, it blocks the entire system.\"  After winning the first leg, Atalanta advanced to the Champions League quarterfinals following another victory in the second leg on March 10, which was played in an empty Mestalla Stadium in Valencia after Spanish authorities prohibited games involving teams from northern Italy to be played with fans. A few thousand Valencia supporters gathered at the Mestalla to welcome the team, though, and to watch the match together in nearby bars and restaurants.  Over the past month, Atalanta has mourned the deaths of five former staff members. While announcements on the club website made no mention of the virus, local media have reported that at least four of them died with COVID-19.  Still, only one positive test from Atalanta has been announced.  \"Some squads have chosen not to test their players unless they show symptoms,\" Tommasi said. \"Other squads tested everyone. These are individual choices.  \"The head of the civil protection agency has talked about the likelihood that for every proven positive case there are probably 10 actual positives. … The high number of positives at Valencia makes you wonder.\"  With the Champions League suspended because of the pandemic, Atalanta has no idea when it might play in the quarterfinals — which again would be the club's biggest game in its history. In the meantime, both the Bergamo team and Valencia are left wondering about the unforeseen effects of their match in February.   ___   Azzoni reported from Madrid.   ___  Associated Press writers Daniella Matar in Milan and Joseph Wilson in Barcelona, and reporter Patricia Thomas in Rome contributed to this report.   ___  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 16, "positive": 33, "negative": 12, "sadness": 1, "disgust": 2, "joy": 2, "anger": 2, "surprise": 5, "fear": 11, "trust": 15}, "metadata": ["san", "italy", "league", "coronavirus", "pandemic", "respiratory", "specialist", "media", "locally", "transmitted", "mayor", "facebook", "virus", "province", "infected", "strict", "1,000", "deadly", "john", "hospital", "institute", "briefing", "crisis", "european", "deaths", "worldwide", "spain", "surpassed", "china", "hopkins", "100,000", "mild", "cough", "pneumonia", "outbreak", "distancing", "di", "sports", "precautions", "united", "chinese", "spreading", "northern"]}, {"text": "CLEVELAND, Nov. 24, 2020 /PRNewswire/ — KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) announced today that Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Chris Gorman and Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer Don Kimble will present at the virtual Goldman Sachs U.S. Financial Services Conference on Tuesday, December 8,…   Continue Reading  ", "emotions": {"positive": 6, "anticipation": 2, "negative": 1}, "metadata": ["virtual"]}, {"text": "Allaying apprehensions, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said people need not panic about availability of essential commodities and medicines during the 21-day nationwide lockdown as the Centre and various state governments will work together to ensure this.

Dr. Harrison, Dr Bob, Thank you very much, Rich. First, I'd like to start by reiterating some basic facts about Coover. 19 people at highest risk of contracting this infection or those who have traveled to places where transmission of the virus is ongoing. We have had close contact with persons with cove it 19 persons that were over 60 years old and those who are with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk of severe outcomes. Earlier this week, we encourage individuals in the most vulnerable groups to follow these proactive measures that will help stop the virus from spreading within the community. Avoid large events and mass gatherings, as well as other settings where you could have close contact. To find his within six feet with a large group of people, continue proactive hygiene measures such as washing your hands frequently, covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or elbow, and frequently cleaning high touch surfaces and stay home. If you are sick and call your primary care physician to discuss next steps to reiterate with Mr Fitzgerald, just said that this time there are no confirmed cases of Covert 19 and Allegheny County as if just as of just a little while ago. The number of presumptive cases in Pennsylvania is 22 most of them in the eastern part of the state. We do believe that the virus will eventually be seen here, too, but we're preparing and prepared for it. There's been a great deal of conversation about testing for Covert 19 1st we want to make sure that we're using the right terminology. Local locally allocating Health department coordinates. The collection of samples for those individuals will be the second criteria for hybrids patients. Once those samples are collected, the specimen is sent to the state lab and results are being received in less than 24 hours. Less urgent cases are being sent to commercial labs for testing as additional labs are being brought online. I'll leave it to a Jan and UPMC to share where they are at this time with testing within their facilities. Testing is not available on demand, much like how other types of medical tests are handled. If a person has symptoms that could be consistent with Cove in 19 they should contact their health care provider for consultation. If they do not have a health care provider, they can contact the health department for consultation. Individuals who believe they need immediate medical attention should contact 911 rather than driving themselves to a hospital. Emergency Service's Have compliment have implemented measures to identify whether 911 callers seeking help art increased risk of having infection with Cove it 19 responders have been provided with enhanced personal protection equipment. Should they encounter somebody who we think could have the virus? Additionally, teams can be deployed to assess those individuals without further exposing the public to the virus. Residents could do their part by getting a flu vaccine and taking every day preventive actions to help stop the spread of germs, including staying home if sick, Covering costs with sneezes with a tissue or using your elbow or sleeve. Washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Oh are available if available. Using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol and routine ING routinely cleaning frequently touched Service's and objects. These measures could go a long way to prevent the spread of illness and respond to the outbreak for all businesses organizations. It's recommending that CDC is guidance Be followed. Encourage sick employees to stay home. We're separating a sick employees emphasized cough and sneeze etiquette and hand i jean performing routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces and providing disposable wives for those surfaces to be used by employees. We're not recommending at this time that large events be canceled or changed, or that businesses and organizations make changes to their operations like we were doing. We suggest that everyone look at or prepare their continuity of operations, plan to make sure that their decisions are based on those plans and what's best for the organization. The department is providing ongoing information on the Corona virus through its website, so it's www dot allegheny county dot us slash corona virus social media pages, Facebook and Twitter on with Allegheny Alerts, which you can find on the Allegheny County website. So with that, I will turn it over to Dr Bogan. Good afternoon. I'm just gonna make just a few reiterations because Dr Harrison covered really the most important information In general, this virus for most people is a mild illness. The people at risk are those that are elderly and have underlying immuno compromise. So again, that's the good news that most people in this illness have mild, mild symptoms. But if you are sick even with mild symptoms, please stay home. Keep your Children home if they're sick as well. And use all the things that Dr Harrison talked about. Hand washing, covering your sneezes, wipe off surfaces and contact the health department. If you have a particular questions at that and your primary care provider for questions as well, No, let me introduce. And again, we're so thankful in this region that we've got such great medical institutions that have reached out and been willing to help. I'm willing to come in this in this time of need. The first speaker I'm gonna come up and say a few words, is Dr Brian Harker. Brian Parker. He's the chief quality and learning officer at Allegheny Health Network. Dr. Parker, thanks on behalf of myself in H and on my mark, health to the county executive for inviting us here today for the last two months, a Chen has been preparing for the Corona virus illness to arrive here in western Pennsylvania. As always, our primary concern is the safety of our patients. Their families are caregivers, and the many communities that we serve has confirmed cases of the disease spread throughout Pennsylvania. We are especially concerned for the elderly, those with existing respiratory conditions and heart conditions, diabetes and those that are immuno compromised to protect those populations and everyone else. We've established a number of safeguards to mitigate the spread. We're limiting the number of visitors and folks who can visit our patients in our hospitals. We put in place new patient screening criteria that all of our facilities we've made modifications to our electronic health record for those screening procedures. And we're working with nursing facilities, rehab facilities and our partners in the community to make sure they're following those protocols as well. We're also working with our home care teams, pre hospital partners. Any M s service is lastly, along with our colleagues at UPMC and across the medical profession, were doing the best to educate the public about the symptoms. Safety tips in the best practices to prepare our hospitals for Corona virus and Cove in 19 in the and the possibility of a significant outbreak or Serge. We're following the recommendations of the CDC and working closely with the county and state health departments were developing inventories of critical equipment and all of the things that we would need to deal with increased volumes of patients. We're conducting regular stress tests and tabletop exercises at our hospital's sharing our learnings and making sure that we're prepared for pandemic level. Infectious patients in our facilities were also working closely with their supply chain partners to make sure we have the necessary and requisite equipment to take care of them across the continuum. If that if this does present itself. We're also working closely with our lab vendors and the folks for testing to be able to do this in house as quickly as we possibly can. And we're working closely with high mark health hi mark ink across our our enterprise to make sure both our patients and members air informed and educated about this disease. As I've said, we've been working on this for many months, but that said and is, Dr Harrison pointed out, we need an engaged community and unengaged public to follow the recommendations of both the departments of health and the CDC to ensure that we have the best. The best possibility of combat combating this coming to our community. Thank you very much. Last speaker. And then we'll open up for questions. Eyes Dr. Danielli. Doctor. Doctor Illes, the chair of emergency medicine of you PNC in the University of Pittsburgh. Dr Gilley. Thank you very much. Executive. It's a privilege to be here today. And, uh, you've heard a lot about Corona virus and some of the preparations that have happened at the governmental level and with some of the health care systems, you might wonder after hearing all this, why are we here today? We're here because you're afraid and there's nothing wrong with that. That's healthy. It is natural to be afraid. And I'm not here to tell you not to be afraid. What I'm here to do is share with you the UPMC in the University of Pittsburgh role in helping to mitigate that fear, making that fear into a tool that helps you manage this particular threat. And we can manage it. It does not have to become incapacitating for all first and foremost, we're prepared to take care of patients who developed the Corona virus infection. We have a large Kadre of hospital beds of all types throughout the county that can serve any type of need. We have outpatient facilities that can a comedy, whatever type of need you have. Call first and engage us, and we'll help walk you through this scary event next. Because you work at an academic world class medical center, I have access to partners that can actually develop approaches that don't exist in other places. We can help identify the virus more frequently. UPMC is working on its own in house test, not just the tests that are brought in by other agencies to help improve the testing ability. So we can describe what's happening here in western Pennsylvania sooner and better, we have experts that are working on ways that once you become ill, that we deliver the best treatment that's available not only standard supportive care but virus directed therapies, and we're engaged with those opportunities right now. Finally, we want to be part of the solution, using that intellectual firepower and the tremendous clinical opportunities to try toe put this virus away definitively. That's gonna require new medications, new vaccinations and perhaps other therapies. They won't come quickly. UPMC and University of Pittsburgh have been ahead of the curve on this. We've been working on agents like this for years, and I think we will have an opportunity to help and this much more quickly than in other settings. I'm happy to answer any other questions. And with that, let us open upto questions and will direct them to the appropriate person. All right. You have people tell enough today have been sick there. Anyone explain? Oh, who wants to jump up? Doctor Merch? Seawater Epidemiologist. Health department. You identify yourself. Hi. Kristen Mertz, medical epidemiologist of the Allegheny County Health Department. So currently, the state Health Department laboratory is doing the test for Kobe. 19. CDC is still doing the test and lab court inquest are now doing Testing recovered 19. So there is laboratory capacity now, and some of that is quite recent. As you know, the state health department started testing last week and the commercial labs this week. Um, there's a slight bottleneck now in specimen collection because the specimens have to be taken with providers using certain protective equipment. And, um, up until very recently it was recommended that everyone haven't fitted in 95 mask, face, shield gloves and gown, which meant that it was difficult to collect the specimens unless you were in an emergency room. Um, that requirement has been loosened a little bit by the CDC, so providers don't have fitted and 95. They could use surgical masks and face shield. But still, we were sort of limited right now in the amount of people who can do specimen collection. So starting next week, we're expecting there to be more specimen collection sites, and we'll be able to test more people. Um, so earlier, before we had this laboratory capacity, um, the criteria for testing were fairly strict, but now they're much more loose, so they'll be much more widespread testing as of this week. David Caplan with Channel four, just expound on that a little bit saying this morning, we're not doing well when testing. I mean, is that vacation body? Bye. We too have got called called and said that they you haven't gotten a call back or have found the response disappointing. So I mean, is there an issue in Allegheny County right now. You wish you had more. I mean, how How can you sort explain the state of play as a the amount of tests where they're coming from getting done? Dr. Marshall? Yeah. So yeah. I mean, I do wish we had more ability to collect specimens, and like I said, several agencies institutions are working on that, and so that should get better next week. We're not at the point now that we're testing anybody with a fever and a cough. So we're testing people who have some kind of ethel epidemiologic risk plus symptoms, so either travel to an international destination or within the U. S. Where there's known ongoing transmission. So we are limited right now in that capacity. You know, in the future, if we start getting cases and it becomes widespread in Allegheny County, I'm sure we'll start testing people who haven't traveled to get a commercial test. However, you do not need approval by the health department. All you need is a physician's prescription. So if your physician thinks you're at risk of covert 19 you get a prescription and the physician con's set up a place for you. to get the specimen collection. Then you can get tested without health department involvement just for clarification. What is the exact reason why people who have a cough or display some of those lesser symptoms that you just described? What is the exact reason that they're not being tested right now is because there aren't enough? Or is it because there's just no reason? If they don't, there's just no reason for them. Well, at present, we don't think there is a reason. I mean, we don't have known transmission in the county. So of course, we'd like to do some testing of those people just to make sure there's no transmission in the county. But we don't want to fill up the ers. Like I said at this week, that yours were really the places that are doing the specimen collection with people at very low risk of disease. So there are other lots of other patients coming to the years for other reasons, and we don't want to use up. All the resource is on low risk people. I if I could jump in here a little bit in the emergency departments were happy to see you. That's not a concern at all, but we want to make it a value event for you and to make sure that we can actually serve you as best as possible. There are many times even before this current Corona virus episode, that people may have wondered about a particular illness or infection and say, I want to be tested for it but required a conversation with their physician, and then a decision often isn't to test necessarily. I think probably a pretty room has had that particular experience. The fear that I talk about may drive people to think that they actually need the test. That does not mean after a little bit of screening together with your physician, that doing the test is the most appropriate next step. And so that's what I would remind you about it having the thought about it. This is where we can manage our concerns about. It's healthy to have the concern, but it's not necessarily healthy to think that every individual thought has to be acted upon. What's the time? Take you sees best. Sorry, just since you are developing one. Yeah, very quick, but I can't give you very specific timeline right now. The truth is, is that we had been working on detections of this and similar viruses prior to the spread into the United States, and I would expect that in a very short period of time, will have on independent tests. The goal is to use that together with what's available from the government and what's available from the private sources that you've heard about to make our ability to diagnose individuals and describe what's happening in western Pennsylvania. Better well, tell me more about that. So I'd say a couple of things. One is as a network. We would look at being able to move patients around across facilities, not look at just a single facility as what are we going to do in one hospital but leverage the assets, including also looking at things like other hardened assets and buildings that we may have that we own a place like potentially, you know, floors that maybe haven't been used recently nursing units that we can as we talked about co hoarding patients doing those sorts of things. So instead of having them spread throughout the facility, you create an area where you've got that population now being cared for by a specific group of caregivers on and also looking to say, you know, is there another place where we can put them that isn't inside a health care facility unnecessarily because they need to be isolated. But their level of care isn't necessarily at the level of the hospital. And that would be true for both patients and four caregivers if we needed to do that in a pandemic situation. What also, what, right now, actually here? Yes. So I would I would have to defer for the icy bed count across the across the region. But I would say, you know, looking at this as a community response because they think we're going to also have to all work together as systems and his hospital's toe also leverage our resources together. Because if we start to see things like what happened on the West Coast, where health care workers were taken out of play for two weeks at a time because of exposures and things like that, we're not gonna be able to do what we have to do from a pandemic standpoint. If that if a surge actually comes here, we've got to think about how we work together on and through the Health Department and through the county executive's office. Uh, let me answer a little bit on the UPMC side, of course, we'd work together with our partners, not only from a chain but other institutions in the region. And as you've noted, we have a very large system right now in Allegheny County, there's a little over 3000 UPMC beds that could easily be increased by another 30 to 40% by already exercises that have been completed. We began preparing in the first week of January, fearing that this might actually be necessary. That's the easy expansion. I suspect we could add even more capacity on top of that of total beds. I think more important than the total bed need is what kind of bed. And secondly, as you heard, what about the other assets, particularly people? I think in any type of broadening exposure of an infection, our healthcare workforce is going to be the most important, and we have a tendency to focus maybe on the physicians or the nurses. But think of all the other people who are involved with care. I think that's where a lot of the planning is gonna have to be making sure that each person is doing what is needed and doing it optimally but not actually wasting activities and making sure that we're deploying every singular resource as best we can. Don't maybe for Dr Harrison. Whoever wants to answer Governor Wolf today. State wine, No large gatherings, he urged, not ordered. But he urged people not go to shopping home movie. Andi took stronger measures in Montgomery County. Rex reported something close. I just wonder what the difference is for us. Is it because firm cases here? Well, I mean, not all doctors and come up. I've also already noted that a number of organizations have canceled events in the near future. Empty bowls, for example, is one of the big events we have that this Sunday has been canceled. We're going to host a G seven and a couple of weeks that has been canceled in a number of other events. But I know different organizations and folks have canceled an abundance of caution. I guess, along with with Governor, Wolf indicated today Montgomery County has a little different situation because they have identified a number of cases we have not at this point. But as Dr Harrison outlined early on, there are some places were certain folks who are in a certain classifications, the elderly and people have immune issues, immunization and immunization issues to avoid certain large crowd events. But I don't Dr Harrison, if you wanted to add to that, I was basically to make those points. So I think most people we're in a bit of an unknown hero right now. This is a new virus. And so I think a lot of people are erring on the side of caution. Um, so each organization makes its own decisions to a certain extent. But I think the key things are that if you're sick, you should definitely not go into a crowded area. And if you are very vulnerable, as we said, you know the case fatality rate goes up after the age of 60 patients with underlying medical conditions. So those very vulnerable patients those are the ones who are vulnerable to severe outcomes. They should not go into large, crowded places. They don't have to that change. If you want all of this go away going Things were being matter. One I'm Dr Mercer looking? Yeah. No. The usual recommendations are for taking community mitigation measures, canceling large events, et cetera. If you have community transmission, I think a lot of places are acting early because they think they're gonna have community transmission, that the way they do in the West Coast and in certain places. But one case might not necessarily change what we say. It depends on the circumstances to It's a case that has hasn't been anywhere, hasn't been in contact with anyone that raises your suspicion for Maybe there's other cases like that. But if it's somebody who comes back from a known country, UH, that has Corona virus hasn't been outdoors since they came back and test positive. I don't think there's any reason to change anything drastically in that situation. So it all depends on the situation around the case. For the first few cases here, no emergency departments have ah, seasonal variation in patient presentation, and this time of the year is common. An elevated amount of beauty visits, either directly to our indirectly related to infections and particularly influenza, and this season is about in the middle of the pack for that. So just as this particular Corona virus infection landed here in the US, we were in the plateau phase of that influenza breakout. Now influenza and Corona virus, even though we have not seen that specific infection here, at least not the cove in 19 are indistinguishable in the beginning. So have I seen people in whom some way you might have had the thought of Covert Viers 19. Yes, but none of them have actually had it here yet. And that's actually the challenge of providing care at this time of the year. I don't know if there'll be any seasonal change with Covert 19. There is often with influenza and other viral illnesses. We simply just don't know much about that right now. I would not describe the current emergency department volumes, at least from the UPM Seaside, as excessively high. One of the things that we're here about is to talk about managing your fear, and what you can do for us is to help people understand that you don't probably need a needy visit if you're not experiencing symptoms at all, particularly if they're not severe. Yeah, I would I would agree with those remarks in terms of the volume. And let's not forget that right now the way you get to the e d for for testing and that evaluation is through a conversation with the county health department or via the clinical suspicion where then we're calling ahead and letting them know that patients coming in to be tested So the number of people that air presenting with a suspicion of just saying I think I have Corona virus is very low. So from a volume standpoint, all those individuals were being very intentionally directed to that location. A CZ. They're funneled in through the system using the screening criteria that exist upfront, either through a phone call or visit to a PCP, a primary care physician's office data captain with Channel four Patching questions. First, can we say how many people have invested in Alligator? And secondly, one of the conversations, like with some of these counties in the eastern part of the state, just in terms how they're monitoring steps they're taking to try and mitigate this coming to Allegheny County? What are you learning from other counties? What can you learn from other counties about what they're doing to try and flattened not all counties have health departments. In fact, very few in the Commonwealth have health departments. Just a handful were one. So a lot of that will be communicated through the state Department of Health. But I'm gonna ask Dr Mertz about that question. I think some of that information comes from the state. Yeah. I mean, I think what we can say about what we've learned from other counties and other countries is that you need to have different approaches simultaneously going on. So the concept of containment is really identifying cases, identifying their contacts there, close contacts and quarantining they're close contacts. So that in itself is very helpful in reducing spread. And then on top of that, adding community mitigation measures of social distancing, um, enhanced cleaning, personal protective measures, measures all those things. So it's really a multi faceted approach that's been shown to help reduce the burden of disease and communities. My first question about the number of people tested in Allegheny County. Yeah, we are not releasing that. And this changing every day, obviously. But that's not something that we're saying. Yeah, I asked why. Um well, frankly, the state just released the numbers for the state. And, um, I don't think that any other counties have done it, so we're sort of following suit. I think that they're controlling this. So we're not permitted tow. Give that information. Yes. What? Why? Yes, we're in touch with all the schools, the school nurse's, the superintendent's et cetera, and that closing of schools is really a case by case decision. It is the school district's prerogative right now to be able to make their own decisions. Um, and I think it depends on the situation. So if they were toe, have a student who tested positive and who had been in the school, then we would work with them to figure out the best approach for that school. So far, obviously, we haven't had that situation, but we are encouraging them to develop plans, developed plans for if they have staff shortages if adults start getting sick, or people have to stay home with their kids to think about online learning if they were too close to think about their school meal programs. Because if they do close um, you know there's some kids that are still gonna need food, but that again would be you know, us talking to the school district on a case by case basis. Thank you. And again, we're very fortunate that we've got some medical experts and living in Pittsburgh having these not every very few communities have what we have. So we're very fortunate to thank all of our facilities today. H n UPMC pit med as well as a health department for work. They do what I would just encourages. Stay tuned. This is obviously is a changing situation as time goes on. But we really want to listen to our medical experts. The science really matters. We want to make sure that we're listening to these folks who have dedicated their lives in their careers to public health and medicine. And that's the best thing we can do. Thank you.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng was 10 points higher at 25,402.40, while the Shanghai Composite rose 0.3% to 3,006.50.  Markets are likely to remain unsteady, said Jingyi Pan of IG.  Firstly, the details of the fiscal support off the US remains uncertain at this point,\" she said in a commentary.  With the virus reaching the shores of the U.S. in a more significant manner only late into February, the economic indicators from the month could altogether be regarded as backward looking at this point and any disappointments potentially not be taken very well.\"  On Wall Street, the day's moves were a microcosm of the severe swings that have dominated recent weeks. Market watchers say investors want to see a big, coordinated response from governments and central banks to shore up the virus-weakened economy.  The S&P 500 surged as much as 3.7% in the morning, only to see the gains evaporate by midday. The index then bounced up and down before turning decisively higher after President Donald Trump pitched his ideas for a break on payroll taxes and other economic relief to Senate Republicans.  By the end of trading, the S&P 500 was up 4.9%. It erased three-fifths of Monday's loss, which was the sharpest since 2008, when global authorities banded together to rescue the economy from the financial crisis.  The volatility reflected the mood of a market just as preoccupied with the virus as the rest of the world.  Since U.S. stocks set their record high just a few weeks ago, traders have crossed over from dismissing the economic pain created by COVID-19 thinking it's similar to the flu and could stay mostly contained in China to being in thrall to it worrying that it may cause a worldwide recession.  While they won't cure illnesses or get quarantined workers back into factories, spending and stimulus programs would put cash into the hands of households and businesses while health experts try to corral the virus. That could stave off or at least moderate a possible recession.  Investors saw glimmers of a coordinated response, which led to Tuesday's optimism.  At a White House press briefing Monday night, Trump said his administration would be asking Congress to cut payroll taxes and pass other quick measures aimed at easing the impact of the coronavirus on workers.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose support would be needed for any deal in a deeply divided Congress. Mnuchin called the meeting productive.  In Japan, a task force set up by the prime minister approved a 430 billion yen ($4.1 billion) package Tuesday with support for small to medium-sized businesses.  Other governments in Asia have announced billions of dollars' worth of stimulus and other measures to help protect their own struggling economies.  But as markets waited on Tuesday for details about Trump's plan, prices oscillated sharply.  After a meeting with major health insurers, Trump said the government is working with the cruise line industry, one of the hardest hit by the virus. That helped lift the market, which had earlier flipped to losses amid doubts that the government would announce anything soon.  I would expect the authorities to pull out all the stops to reduce uncertainty,\" said Alec Young, managing director of Treasury yields pushed higher on Tuesday but fell back early Wednesday. The bond market rang warning bells about the virus long before the stock market, and a rise in yields signals fear has receded a bit.  The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 0.68% from 0.79%. A week ago, it had never been below 1%.  The S&P 500 rose 4.9% to 2,882.23. The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 4.9% to 25,018.16, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 5%, to 8,344.25.  That pulled the market a bit further from the brink of a bear market, signified by a drop of 20% from a record. The S&P 500 is down 14.9% from its high. If it can rally back to that point, it would extend the longest-ever bull market, which began its climb after the market hit bottom on March 9, 2009.  Oil prices, which plunged 25% on Monday amid a price war between producers, have steadied in the past two days.  For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.  In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered.  But because the virus is new, experts can't say for sure how far it will ultimately spread. That has investors worried about a worst-case scenario for corporate profits and the economy, where factories and supply chains are shut around the world due to quarantines and people stay huddled at home instead of working or spending.

The Minneapolis Convention Center notified the Executive Committee of UMC’s Commission on the General Conference that the venue was not holding large events through May 10, a news release from the church’s press center said.  The convention center’s restrictions, the release said, are based on Minnesota Department of Health recommendations to mitigate the spread of coronavirus, which has caused a global pandemic of respiratory illness and death. The virus is also known as COVID-19.  The release quoted Kim Simpson, chair of the General Conference Commission, who said the convention center’s restrictions are “not unexpected based on the current guidance from health officials, and we expect to move forward with new plans as quickly as possible.”  The release said the commission “has been monitoring the situation for some time” and had scheduled a teleconference of the full commission for March 21 to discuss plans for the event. Only the full commission has the authority to change the date of the General Conference, the release said.  As of Wednesday, that teleconference was still scheduled, the release said, but added that it’s uncertain when the commission would be able to announce new dates. The release also said the commission had already been approached with many requests to postpone the General Conference over the spreading pandemic.  United Methodist News reported that one request for postponement expressed concern about the complex issues regarding travel for the many delegates from nations across the globe. The report said that “About 43 percent of General Conference delegates come from Africa, Europe or the Philippines.”  In the release, Simpson said, “Our focus in this moment is not solely on the gathering of the General Conference for the work we have been called to do, but is on the individuals, families, churches and communities around the world whose lives are being impacted by this pandemic.  “We recognize the struggle to deal with the physical, emotional and spiritual needs which come with the unknown. We are confident that local United Methodist churches will be finding new ways to be in community with their neighbors and meet their evolving needs.”  Simpson said in a phone interview that the chief concern for her and the commission is the health and welfare of the delegates who attend the event. She added that “It’s our responsibility to provide the vehicle that allows all delegates to participate fully in the General Conference.”  Simpson is the treasurer for the Metropolitan Board of Missions of The United Methodist Church.

Let’s play two? Colorado Rockies manager Bud Black would be down for doubleheaders.  Maybe even a couple a week.  That might be a necessity to make up games once a baseball season delayed by the new coronavirus gets underway.  “In theory, yeah, I think all of us would be up for some sort of doubleheader situation,” Black said during a conference call Thursday. “The thing that’s going to be in front of all of us is it’s going to be the same for everybody. It’s got to make sense for the clubs and the players.”  Opening Day has been pushed back from March 26 to mid-May at the earliest, and both sides are committed to playing as many games as possible.  Translation: Doubleheaders could be on the docket.  “I know that when we’re able to safely play, we’re going to have to think of creative ways to get in as many games as possible given all the time that’s going to be lost,” said Farhan Zaidi, the president of baseball operations for the San Francisco Giants. “I don’t really have any specific thoughts on that, but I know everybody’s going to be thinking through ways to do that.”  Two pitchers announced they are having Tommy John surgery and will miss the season whenever it starts: Boston ace left-hander Chris Sale and San Francisco right-hander Tyler Beede.  Major League Baseball announced minor league players shut out of spring training camps amid the coronavirus outbreak will receive allowances from teams through April 8, and a plan is underway to compensate those players during the postponed portion of the regular season. Minor leaguers will receive allowances of $400 per week from teams in a lump sum for the next three weeks — a significant bump from their usual spring per diems of $100-200 per week. Teams hope that will allow players to cover housing, food and other expenses through the previously scheduled end of spring training.  The Rockies and Arizona Diamondbacks halted their voluntary workouts at their shared Salt River Fields complex in Arizona. This was after the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community decided to temporarily cease operations there in the wake of the pandemic.  Some of the Colorado players might travel to Denver with Coors Field open for workouts. The Mile High City sure looked a lot different than Scottsdale on Thursday as a snowstorm hit the area.  More than anything, Black wants his players to treat this time away like it’s December and the season is still in the distance.   Don’t ramp up.  Black said when a timetable is known, the teams will be given approximately three weeks to get back in shape as part of a second spring training. That’s plenty of time for a starting pitcher to work his way into form.  “There’s no need to throw bullpens. We’re a ways away from that,” Black said.  Hit in a cage — if one’s available. Work out at their gym at home. Or play catch — with social distancing in mind.  “They get together and go to a local park, they go to a high school, they go somewhere where there’s a stretch of grass and they play catch,” Black said. “They’re not going to play closer than six feet together, right? You can play catch.  “Guys are on the down low. They’re probably not doing much baseball activity right now. There’s a sense this is going to be much longer than first anticipated by baseball.”  Seattle shuttered its facility in Peoria, Ariz. The Mariners initially had planned to keep the facility open and work with players in small, staggered groups of 10, but general manager Jerry Dipoto said most of the 40-man roster went home.  “As we got to the point yesterday where we pulled the plug there were about 10 or 12 guys that were actually coming down and taking advantage of the workout time,” Dipoto said. “And frankly, we were concerned with the idea of group gatherings of any sort, particularly after we got the news yesterday there was a positive test of a baseball staffer down here in Arizona with another club.”  On Wednesday, the Cincinnati Reds, whose training facility is in Goodyear, Ariz., said an employee who works year-round at the complex tested positive for covid-19. All Reds employees who were in contact with the employee during spring training are being tested and have self-quarantined. Dipoto said no Mariners players or staff have reported showing any symptoms of coronavirus.  In Dallas, there about five major leaguers working out at the Texas Rangers’ youth academy. It’s closed to public and has been sanitized.  At their facility in Bradenton, Fla., the Pittsburgh Pirates have a small contingent of players who work out on an informal basis, rotating in and out to make sure there’s not more than a handful at a time.  Opening Day would’ve been next week. That’s hard for Black to fathom in light of what’s happening around the world.  “I miss the build-up to Opening Day. I miss what that’s all about. I love our sport. I love the people in it,” Black said. “I’m probably as practical as they come and a realist, and aware of what’s going on and that takes a precedence over our sport and our jobs.”   Categories: MLB | Sports  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 10, "positive": 20, "negative": 13, "sadness": 1, "disgust": 1, "joy": 3, "anger": 4, "surprise": 1, "fear": 2, "trust": 1}, "metadata": ["colorado", "coronavirus", "san", "john", "league", "outbreak", "postponed", "arizona", "indian", "distancing", "facility", "initially", "gatherings", "symptoms", "texas", "pittsburgh", "sports"]}, {"text": "Flights were briefly suspended at New York City-area airports Saturday afternoon, as the Federal Aviation Administration moved to respond to an air traffic controller trainee who tested positive for COVID-19.  The trainee works at the FAA’s New York Air Route Traffic Control Center in Ronkonkoma, Long Island, which handles high-altitude flights heading to local and those flying over the region to places like Europe. Once planes get closer to the airport they are heading to, the flights are transferred to the towers at those airports.  Though the trainee had not been at the Ronkonoma facility since Tuesday, once the test came back positive, part of the center had to be cleared out for a deep cleaning. “We have contacted local health authorities and we are developing a plan to quickly sanitize/clean the affected areas,” the FAA said in a statement.  That meant that the flights normally handled by the controllers in that section of the Ronkonoma center had to be shifted to other air traffic controllers. In order to manage the shift, the FAA put a “ground stop” in effect.  A ground stop meant that no new flights could go into or out of the air space, so effectively all flights that were getting ready to leave from JFK, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty were paused for about a half hour, and some flights heading toward the region were turned around.  The stoppage also included Philadelphia’s airport, Teterboro Airport in New Jersey and MacArthur Airport in Islip, Long Island.

In a cavernous exhibit hall usually bustling with business activity, 35 men and women of the 146th Air Lift Wing out of the Channel Islands set up row after row of cots in clusters of 10 — the sound of the metal legs hitting the hard floor echoing off the walls and a forklift transporting boxes of pillows and blankets whirring in the background.  The makeshift health care center will be able to hold up to 250 patients who have tested positive for the disease. Hospitals will refer people to the facility who are well enough that they don’t require ventilators or other intensive care, but who don’t have a safe place to recuperate. That could mean people who are homeless, but also people who live in crowded homes.  The purpose, said Jennifer Tong, the associate chief medical officer at the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center and one of the doctors leading the county’s fight against the virus, is to be “prepared for the surge.”  County officials haven’t said exactly when they think that will occur, but John Swartzberg, clinical professor emeritus of infectious diseases at UC Berkeley, said he expects a surge within the next week or two.   - ADVERTISEMENT -  “That’s what the modeling suggests,” he said.  Tong said patients could begin to fill the beds as early as next week. It’s unclear how long the convention center will operate as a medical facility. Doctors and nurses from hospitals across Santa Clara County will provide care.  The convention center will include one side for women and one for men, anchored by a makeshift nursing station in the center. Originally, there had been some discussion of using the facility to treat non-coronavirus patients, but that idea was scrapped because of concerns that someone could accidentally be brought in without any symptoms for the virus but later test positive and inadvertently spread the disease.  On Friday, National Guard members — who yesterday set up a facility in Southern California and tomorrow will move to another location — quickly made up the thin mattresses with crisp white sheets, placing pillows, towels and bright yellow blankets on each bed and folding chairs nearby. Clipboards hung from each bed frame, awaiting medical records and nursing notes. Temporary hand washing stations and bright red trash cans dotted the space.  At one point, Santa Clara Councilwoman Kathy Watanabe, who was helping with preparations, sped by, pausing only briefly to greet a county employee.  Patients, Tong said, could be housed at the facility for two or three weeks.  “We didn’t want to expose [uninfected] individuals,” she said.   ___  © 2020 the San Jose Mercury News  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 10, "positive": 15, "negative": 4, "disgust": 3, "joy": 1, "anger": 4, "surprise": 3, "fear": 2, "trust": 5}, "metadata": ["surge", "coronavirus", "dozens", "california", "santa", "convention", "facility", "ventilators", "john", "professor", "infectious", "diseases", "beds", "nursing", "symptoms", "virus", "awaiting", "pausing", "san"]}, {"text": "CORONAVIRUS cases in Austria are continuing to rise, with 246 confirmed reports of the virus.

If you are flying to Austria in the next few days, then your flights will remain unaffected.  However, you are advised to keep up to date with the latest travel advice as it is likely to change at short notice.  Concerned passengers can contact their airline to find out whether they can change their flights if concerned, but they are unlikely to offer refunds or free changes.  The only time that tour operators are required to give a refund on holiday packages is if the Foreign Office changes its travel advice for a region and turns it into a no-go area, which they have not done in this case.  Independent hotels are not even required to refund money in this instance, so if you have paid in advance and choose not to turn up then you will lose your money.  If the hotel is a large chain, it could be worth asking to change your stay to another location or delay your trip but they are under no obligation to grant this.

(Lightspring/Shutterstock)  Growing Concerns of Coronavirus Should Spur Plans—Not Panic  Workplaces should prepare appropriate measures to combat spread of virus and not scare employees  Chances are if you work for a large company, you received an email like one sent to Volkswagen employees March 2: Coronavirus concerns mean some limits on business travel, everyone should remember to “ wash your hands frequently ” and stay home if sick.  As the viral illness, dubbed COVID-19, continues to spread, some employers are canceling conferences and limiting travel, checking supplies, and dusting off their emergency preparedness plans, just as they have for previous outbreaks or for natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes.  All workplaces, corporate benefit and health experts say, should have plans that focus on preparation, not fear. Currently, cases of COVID-19 are still rare in the U.S.—far fewer than seasonal influenza cases.  “Scaring the crap out of employees isn’t helpful,” said labor and employment attorney Mark Neuberger in Miami. “Employee communication is critical. Stay in touch and up-to-date” with the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention information, and “don’t panic” employees.  He and other experts recommend employers outline policies about teleworking, travel and sick leave; monitor recommendations from the CDC and local health officials; and stock up on needed office supplies and other products that might be affected by a global manufacturing slowdown.  The CDC has said the current risk in the U.S. from the virus is low, but it encourages employers to develop plans in case the virus becomes more widespread, potentially resulting in containment efforts that might include closing schools, limiting public transportation or canceling large gatherings.  Still, while emergency plans and workplace policies are important, employers are warned not to go too far.  “They can’t do it in a discriminatory fashion,” said Sara Rosenbaum, a health law professor at George Washington University. “The thing that is most worrisome is for people of Asian descent, whether they are singled out. That would be Exhibit A for discrimination.”  Federal laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act and other statutes, limit the types of health information employers can seek about their employees―and they prohibit discrimination based on disability or other factors, including national origin.  The types of questions matter.  Employers can’t, for example, ask questions that might indicate a person has an underlying health condition or disability, such as: “Do you have a compromised immune system?”  But, during a pandemic, they can ask whether a worker has flu-like symptoms, according to guidance developed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2009 following an outbreak of the H1N1 virus. And if so, they can send sick workers home.  Depending on how serious the outbreak becomes, employers could also measure workers’ temperatures, which under ordinary conditions would be considered a medical exam and thus barred.  In a pandemic, taking temperatures would be OK if the disease in question is more serious than seasonal flu and “becomes widespread in the community as assessed by state or local health authorities,” the EEOC said.   What About Travel?  Some employers, including Nestlé, are restricting business-related international travel. Others are limiting trips to affected areas. Some, including Volkswagen, are asking workers who return from areas where the virus is endemic to stay away from the office for 14 days. Both of these companies are headquartered near Washington, D.C., but have offices and facilities around the country.  No matter what, legal experts say, employers should not single out particular employees for travel restrictions, health tests, quarantines or any other policy.  “If there is some policy implemented with respect to overseas travel, it should apply to all people who engage in travel, not just those of a particular race, nationality or origin,” said Phyllis Pari, an attorney in Connecticut who represents employers.  And employers should consider continuing regular pay for workers who are required to stay at home for 14 days, rather than making them use sick time or vacation, Neuberger said.  That way, they won’t have “disgruntled employees forced to stay home who won’t have vacation or time off for the rest of the year,” he said.  Still, some employees may become unhappy as companies weigh other decisions.  Just this week, an estimated 3,000 sales employees of Workday, a California-based analytics company, learned they won’t be enjoying the Florida sunshine since the company canceled its annual sales meeting set for early March in Orlando.  The travel and convention industry is already taking a hit. On Thursday, it took another when Facebook said it would cancel its annual F8 software developer conference set for May in San Jose, California, that was expected to draw 5,000 people. That comes not long after Facebook canceled its global marketing summit set for San Francisco in March.  While firms say they are reacting out of an abundance of caution, they are also considering how fast the virus has spread―much of it because of international travel―after emerging in China late last year. Cases have been reported in more than 40 countries.  Travel and airline stocks were among the hardest hit this week as the overall stock market declined, largely over fears about the effect COVID-19 might have on the global economy.  Still, many conventions are moving forward, albeit with a public health message similar to that being pushed out by many employers: Don’t panic, the risk is low, and wash your hands!  As of Feb. 27, 2020, the giant HIMSS Global Health Conference & Exhibition is still planned for March in Orlando, where it may draw nearly 45,000 information technology professionals from around the world.  This year, though, it will have a special medical office on-site dedicated to addressing flu-like symptoms, and with the ability to isolate people who do show such symptoms—plus, extra hand sanitizer stations and direct access to Florida Department of Health Experts.  Oh, and organizers have declared the conference “a handshake-free meeting.”  Julie Appleby is a senior correspondent who reports on the health law’s implementation, health care treatments and costs, trends in health insurance, and policy affecting hospitals and other medical providers.

On March 16, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz ordered everything, except supermarkets and medical facilities, to shut down in the hopes of preventing a coronavirus outbreak similar to the one which ravaged Italy.  Those restrictions are finally beginning to be lifted on Tuesday as non-essential stores under 400 square meters (4,300 square feet), such as hardware stores and garden centers, will open their doors once more. They will be followed by shopping malls, hairdressers and other larger shops on May 1.  Restaurants and hotels won't reopen until mid-May at the earliest, and public events likely won't take place in Austria until late June.

Some 504,000 people registered unemployed in Austria at the beginning of April, so the government is hoping that its early action to stem the tide of initial infection can be mirrored by an earlier reopening of the economy.  Denmark was also among the first European countries to impose a strict lockdown on its citizens and, in doing so, avoided a significant spike in coronavirus cases, unlike its neighbour Sweden, which opted not to enter a lockdown, relying instead on the theory of herd immunity.  Among the Danish population, there was overwhelming support for the initial lockdown but there is now an apparent backlash at the recently-announced emergence. Denmark will reopen day care centers and schools on April 15, before staggering its economic reawakening, opening small stores and DIY shops, then parks and larger stores, and then the gradual reopening of bars, hotels and restaurants. The public will be asked to wear masks.  The optics of sending the country’s children back out into the world first has unnerved many in Danish society, some of whom established the Facebook group, “Mit barn skal ikke være forsøgskanin for covid-19” — roughly translated as “my child is not a guinea pig for Covid-19” — which currently boasts over 39,000 members.

The number of increased arrests in the run-up to April 12 came amid a renewed government clampdown on workers, in which construction was no longer deemed ‘essential’.  The weekend of April 4 and 5 saw 359 people detained and 43,563 handed fines.

The head of the Revolutionary Guards in Iran has made the claim that the outbreak of coronavirus may be a biological attack on China and Iran by the United States according to the Daily Mail.  When addressing a crowd in Kerman on Thursday, Hossein Salami said that the outbreak in Iran, “may be the product of the American biological invasion.”  Salami did not provide any evidence to support his claims about the virus, which scientists believe was transferred from animals to humans last year in China.  “We will win in the fight against the virus, which may be the product of the American biological invasion, which first spread to China and then to Iran and the rest of the world,” he said.  “Today the country is engaged in a biological battle,” said Salami, according to a ISNA news agency. “Even today, we will win, even in the fight against the virus. The U.S. must know that if it did it, [the virus] will return to it.”  Theories like these are common among the Islamic Revolutionary Guard and has become more usual since the death of Quassem Soleimani, which was a result of U.S. drone strike in January.  On Tuesday, it was also suggested by Gholam Reza Jalali, an Iranian civil defence chief, that the outbreak of the virus is a “biological attack” against the Iran and China.  There are still scientific investigations under way on the virus, though there is no evidence to show that it was deliberately manufactured. The origin of the virus, which emerged from near a seafood market the city of Wuhan, in China, is still unknown.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, “Early on, many of the patients at the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread.”  “Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread.”  There were 15 deaths announced in Iran Today, bringing the total number to 107. Iran has the highest reported death toll outside of China. There were 591 cases of coronavirus reported by the Islamic republic, which brings the total number to 3,513.  Many suspect that the figures provided by the regime are lower than the actual numbers.  Brian Hook, U.S. Special Representative for Iran and Senior Policy Advisor to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, told European reporters that “Iran lied to its own people about the coronavirus.”  “It told them it was not anything to worry about but at the same time the virus was spreading throughout Iran.”  There is also a shortage of medical equipment, face masks, and ventilators in Iran, and Friday prayers have been canceled in the country’s major cities for a few weeks running.  Health minister Saeed Namaki noted that “Schools and universities will be closed until the end” of the school year.  “People should not consider this as an opportunity to go traveling,” said Namaki. “They should stay home and take our warnings seriously.”  “This virus is highly contagious. It is a serious matter, do not joke about it.”  According to Namaki, the country has started implementing a national plan to fight the virus and will start in the locations most affected by it. “Our method is not going into homes,” Namaki said. “We can use digital communications and ultimately the telephone. So we don’t see a reason to go to the doors of peoples’ homes.”  World Health Organization members recently landed in Tehran to assess the situation.

Former White House senior counselor to President Donald Trump Steve Bannon is pictured on November 8, 2019 in Washington, DC. Bannon has repeated a conspiracy theory that China was responsible for the coronavirus. Alex Wong/Getty Images  Bannon, who served during the first seven months of Trump's administration said that the U.S. investigation meant that \"we're going to find out over time if this came from the... lab in Wuhan.\"  He believed China knew about the ability of the disease to be transmitted from human to human in December 2019 and believed that \"if they had told the world at the time\", then, \"95 percent of the economic devastation and 95 percent of the people dead would have never happened.\"  \"This to me is premeditated murder, they're guilty of hiding this from people throughout the world, just like a biological Chernobyl. They've got to be held accountable,\" he told United We Stand, a show for Sinclair Broadcast Group, which frequently airs right-wing views, according to Media Matters for America.  \"If we find out later from (Vice President Mike) Pompeo and the president's investigation by the intelligence services that it actually came out of the lab on one of these experiments they've been doing, then all bets are off. Because that's raising it to an entirely different level.\"  Bannon told host Eric Bolling that the global community could be demanding trillions in reparation, because, \"if it turns out it came out of a lab, and this was one of their experiments that got loose, and they have direct culpability in that regard, to me, that means they are not a legitimate government.\"  Chinese officials have denied any cover up and this week Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang told reporters, \"The U.S. should know this: The enemy is the virus, not China.\"  Meanwhile European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has called for an international approach to investigating the origin of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, urging China and other nations to join the probe.  Newsweek has contacted the Chinese foreign ministry and the White House for further comment.

(AP) - A state senator whose Omaha law practice often takes him into the Douglas County Courthouse has raised the volume of his calls to close it, citing the COVID-19 diagnosis of a prosecuting attorney.  The prosecutor found out Monday that he was infected. The more than 50 people he’d recently had close contact with at the courthouse - including eight judges, several colleagues and a dozen public defenders - now are supposed to isolate themselves for two weeks. The courthouse spaces have since been deep cleaned.  The call to close the courthouse came as the presiding judge for Douglas County District Court on Thursday ordered all jury trials postponed further until after June 1.  For most people, COVID-19 causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. Older adults and people with existing health problems are among those particularly susceptible.  State Sen. Justin Wayne told the Omaha World-Herald he’d urged city and county officials to close the downtown building last week. The need is greater now, he said, adding that many hearings can be conducted by phone or videoconferencing.  “I am saying, ‘Shut down the Douglas County Courthouse.’ Our physical presence is just not necessary,” he said.

(KTAL/KMSS) – A new campaign has been launched to boost tourism in Shreveport-Bossier following the coronavirus pandemic.  The Shreveport-Bossier Convention and Tourist Bureau announced Wednesday that it is rolling out the “Shreveport-Bossier Comeback” campaign.  The a weeklong promotion, which will showcase the community’s resiliency, will run in conjunction with the 37th Annual National Travel and Tourism Week May 3-9.  This campaign includes a partnership with United Way of Northwest Louisiana in an effort to financially assist staff members in the tourism industry, including restaurants, attractions, casinos, hotels and more that were affected by COVID-19.  This partnership includes a joint fundraising effort to support a large segment of the Asset Limited Income Constrained Employed population with a COVID Relief Fund. As the needs of these ALICE families evolve, the United for NWLA fund will also evolve to address ALICE’s most urgent, unmet needs.  ALICE is a new way of defining and understanding the struggles of households that earn above the Federal Poverty Level, but not enough to afford a bare-bones household budget. The most recent ALICE report shows that 53% of households in Northwest Louisiana struggle to make ends meet day-to-day.  United Way is currently accepting donations and applications for the Shreveport-Bossier Hospitality Relief Fund. For more information, visit www.unitedwaynwla.org.  President and CEO of United Way Dr. Bruce Willson, Jr. said, “A large segment of the ALICE population are often one car repair, health emergency or missed paycheck away from falling into financial crisis. This partnership between United Way and Shreveport-Bossier Tourist and Convention Bureau will hopefully assist individuals and families from falling off a financial cliff.”  Since in-person rallies and events that have been hallmarks of NTTW in years past are no longer an option, the Tourist Bureau is rolling out a virtual-specific marketing campaign, Shreveport-Bossier Comeback.  This campaign was built to boost a durable community comeback that is strictly aligned with government mandates and the unwavering spirit of travel in an effort to support Shreveport-Bossier’s economy.  A few components of this campaign include interactive social media content, strategic marketing initiatives, thematic editorial pieces, and digital promotions that spark the interest of Shreveport-Bossier residents and visitors.  President of The Tourist Burea Stacy Brown said, “Although we can’t meet in person, we can stay connected, unified and supportive of one another from afar while rallying around the spirit of travel. We anticipate a robust comeback for our community. Shreveport-Bossier has a reputation of being a premier destination in the Ark-La-Tex region, so when travelers can safely visit, we will welcome them back.”  For more information about National Travel and Tourism Week in Shreveport-Bossier, visit www.Shreveport-Bossier.org/NTTW.

As cases have skyrocketed around the country, the White House's messaging toward the virus has dramatically shifted from saying they had already \"shut it down\" in regard to the spread of COVID-19, to daily press briefings addressing the growing number of cases.  The ad from the Republicans for the Rule of Law, who backed the president’s impeachment, shows Trump speaking about the issue in January, when there was just one confirmed case. Trump said then he was not at all concerned about a pandemic striking the U.S.  From 'great' to 'blindsided': How Trump changed his coronavirus message amid fear, confusion in the White House  The video moves through a timeline of the morphing messaging from Trump and members of his administration on the coronavirus as cases in the U.S. dramatically increased.  The ad highlights the president, speaking to a gathering of African-American leaders in late February at the White House, claimed the virus was going \"to disappear. One day – it's like a miracle.\" It also notes when he falsely underplayed the amount of time required to develop a vaccine.  This new ad from@ForTheRuleOfLaw will run Friday morning on Fox and Friends.  \"We pretty much shut it down...It'll be down to close to zero...It's really working out...No, I don't take responsibility at all.\"  America needs a president who tells the truth.

Be right. Be credible. President Trump has often been first but he has seldom been right and he has never been credible.\"  \"President Trump bears responsibility for misleading his supporters,\" the statement said.  'There’s no magic drug out there': What the people in charge are saying about coronavirus  The video includes a moment at the beginning of March when Trump dismissed a reporter by saying \"That's CNN – fake news!\" when asked if his administration was taking the disease seriously. Cases had surged then to 262.  The video shows Trump saying on March 15, when the number of cases had grown to nearly 3,500, that the virus was “something that we have tremendous control over,” though noting it was extremely contagious.  On March 17, Trump said he'd \"rate it a 10\" when asked about his response to the pandemic.  \"I thought it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic,\" he said, contradicting earlier claims.  Coronavirus live updates: Gov. orders Californians to stay home; Italy surpasses China's death toll; Saints' Sean Payton has virus  \"Accurate and timely information is America’s most potent defense against the pandemic we now face,\" Truax continued, saying the majority of \"Republicans who have been misled by the president’s self-serving coronavirus lies are our families, our friends, and our neighbors.\"  \"We urge them, and all Americans, to get their coronavirus information from the CDC and other reliable sources.

The virus has spread to at least 70 countries. China has locked down over a dozen cities to contain the outbreak. China is the epicenter of global manufacturing and is deeply integrated into global supply chain. So, the outbreak has affected not only Chinese economy but also dozens of other economies. Here we take a look at the top 10 economies worst affected by coronavirus.  Coronavirus a major threat to global economy  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has reduced global economic growth forecast for 2020 from 2.9% to 2.4%. The think tank warned that if the virus continues to spread, the growth forecast could be further reduced to 1.5%.  Factories in China and many other countries have suspended operations. Many banks and technology companies have asked their employees to stay at home to contain the virus. Hundreds of flights have been canceled as the outbreak has affected international business travel. According to the International Air Transportation Association (IATA), the global airline industry is estimated to lose $29 billion due to the virus.

Q3 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and more Interview with Shree Viswanathan ValueWalk's ValueTalks ·  Corporate giants like Apple, Microsoft, United Airlines, and Mastercard have warned of a decline in profits and sales. People are choosing to stay at home. As a result, shops, restaurants, and other outlets have witnessed a steep fall in demand. Car sales in China fell as much as 92% in February. Worried individuals are avoiding activities that could expose them to the novel coronavirus.  The virus disrupts China’s manufacturing  Of course, the Chinese economy is the worst affected by coronavirus. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), China’s Manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) has fallen to 37.5. That’s the lowest PMI reading since 2004. A PMI below 50 indicates contraction. The decline has been a direct consequence of the coronavirus outbreak.  China is the global manufacturing hub. A manufacturing slowdown in the country “will have a ripple effect” on the global economic activities. According to a report from UNCTAD, the falling output in China has caused a $50 billion decline in worldwide exports in the month of February alone. The most affected sectors were machinery, precision instruments, automotive equipment, and communication equipment.  “The #coronavirus outbreak carries serious risks for the global economy,” UNCTAD head @UNCTADKituyi said. “Any manufacturing slowdown in one part of the world has a ripple effect in economic activity globally because of regional & global value chains.” ➡ https://t.co/GsRbia9VRS pic.twitter.com/P0FabCrzGj — UNCTAD (@UNCTAD) March 4, 2020  Economists polled by Reuters expect China’s GDP growth to fall to 4.5% in the first quarter of 2020 from 6% in the precious quarter. Dozens of countries rely heavy on Chinese suppliers for components or raw materials. The virus could further disrupt the long-term supply chain. The long-term effects on global economy will depend on changes in the sources of supply and the containment of the virus. No one knows in which direction things will go.  Ten economies worst affected by coronavirus  In its latest report, the UNCTAD has published the list of economies worst affected by coronavirus. The report is based on the trade impact in the month of February 2020 due to the disruption in Chinese supply.   10- Switzerland, $1.08 billion  The trade impact for Switzerland was a little over $1 billion in February due to the coronavirus outbreak. Switzerland is not even among China’s top ten biggest trading partners. But China is a huge market for Swiss goods. The sectors most affected were chemicals, machinery, and precision instruments.   9- Mexico, $1.36 billion  Mexico suffered a trade impact of $1.36 billion last month due to the disruption in Chinese supply. It’s among economies worst affected by coronavirus. Mexico imports more than $44 billion worth of goods from China a year. The sectors that suffered the biggest blow were automotive equipment and electrical machinery.  8- United Kingdom, $1.91 billion  The UK is one of China’s largest trading partners. The disruptions in Chinese supply chain had a $1.91 billion trade impact on the country. The worst affected sectors were the automotive equipment, chemicals, and machinery.   7- Singapore, $2.16 billion  Last year, Singapore was one of the biggest winners from the US-China trade war. But the island nation took a trade impact of $2.16 billion in February as coronavirus disrupted the Chinese manufacturing and supply chain. Communication equipment and electric machinery were the most affected sectors, according to UNCTAD.   6- Vietnam, $2.3 billion  Vietnam is a rapidly growing electronic manufacturing hub. It is also one of China’s largest trading partners. So, the coronavirus-caused disruption in Chinese supply had a $2.3 billion trade impact on Vietnam. The sectors worst affected were communication equipment, leather products, and machinery.   5- Taiwan, $2.6 billion  Taiwan is a leading manufacturer of electronic products and office machines. China is Taiwan’s largest trading partner, accounting for nearly 30% of its exports. According to UNCTAD, the trade impact for Taiwan was $2.6 billion in February. As expected, the most affected sectors were communication equipment, office equipment, and electrical machinery.  4- South Korea, $3.8 billion  South Korea runs a huge trade surplus in China. In the last couple of weeks, South Korea itself is struggling to contain coronavirus. There have been at least 6,000 confirmed cases so far. The trade impact for South Korea was $3.8 billion due to the disruption in Chinese supply chain. The worst affected sectors were machinery, communication equipment, and automotive equipment.   3- Japan, $5.2 billion  Japan is one of the few countries that enjoy a huge trade surplus with China. Japanese companies have a strong presence in China. So, a disruption in the Chinese supply chain is bound to affect Japan. According to UNCTAD, the trade impact for Japan was a staggering $5.2 billion. The most affected sectors were machinery, automotive equipment, and communication equipment.  2- United States, $5.8 billion  The United States is among economies worst affected by coronavirus as the manufacturing slowdown in China disrupts global trade. The estimated trade impact for the US was $5.8 billion. The sectors most affected were precision instruments, machinery, chemicals, and automotive equipment.  As coronavirus continues to spread in the US, the Federal Reserve has slashed interest rates by 50 basis points to boost the economy. According to Goldman Sachs, the outbreak could reduce the US GDP growth by as much as one percentage point in 2020.  1- European Union, $15.6 billion  The European Union is the economy worst affected by coronavirus in China. The most affected sectors are machinery, automotive equipment, chemicals, and precision instruments. The epidemic is evolving rapidly. If not contained, coronavirus could have a much bigger economic impact worldwide, especially considering the importance of China in the global value chain.

The virus that causes COVID-19 has swept the globe with about 1.3 million infections and 70,000 deaths through Sunday evening.Development of a widely available vaccine can take a year or more while a virus continues its rampage.  Key to the race to develop a vaccine for the new coronavirus is a technology that uses the virus' genetic code to essentially persuade your body to make its own vaccine.  This technique is faster than egg-based manufacturing, which produces the majority of annual flu vaccines and led to delays in distributing a vaccine for H1N1 during the 2009 pandemic.  And it's enabling a possible vaccine for the new coronavirus to be developed in record time.  Coronavirus updates: Get the latest in USA TODAY's live blog  “It’s quicker to get started,” said Clem Lewin, who is working on vaccine candidates for the manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur. “All you need is the blueprint for the protein.\"  Testing still will take time. Scientists must determine whether any of several vaccine candidates fight the virus effectively. If so, they need to determine the proper dose. This tinkering is what could take a year or more.  When the first potential vaccine from the manufacturer Moderna was injected into people on March 16, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he believed the coronavirus vaccine was being developed at a record pace. It took 63 days to go from identifying a virus’s genetic sequence to testing a vaccine in people.   Scrambling egg-based production  Several manufacturers pursuing a vaccine for the latest coronavirus have been aided by a technological innovation.  The method that Moderna, Sanofi and others are pursuing is different from traditional vaccinations, in which a weakened or dead version of the virus is introduced into the body, triggering it to create antibodies that would attack the live virus should the person be exposed to it.  In the new approach, pieces of messenger RNA that hold the chemical template of a spike protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus are injected into a human, said Mark Slifka, a professor of viral immunology at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, Oregon.  The spikes are what the virus uses to attach to a human cell — the first step in sickening someone.  In response to the injection of those molecules, the cells in the body produce the spike protein encoded by that mRNA. That triggers the body to mount an immune response to that viral protein, just as in traditional vaccines.  “Essentially, the patient makes their own vaccine,” says the narrator of a Moderna video about the vaccine. “This cuts out the middleman.”  Fauci said volunteers would be given two injections of the potential coronavirus vaccine, the second after 28 days. The doses are 25 milligrams, 100 milligrams and 250 milligrams, he said.  “The individuals will be followed for one year — both for safety and whether it induces the kind of response that we predict would be protective,” Fauci said.  Moderna, the manufacturer conducting the initial tests, projected the first commercially available vaccine in 12 to 18 months. A corporate filing March 23 said CEO Stephane Banceltold Goldman Sachs “it is possible that under emergency use, a vaccine could be available to some people, possibly including healthcare professionals, in the fall of 2020.”  Why change the menu from reliable eggs?  Most flu vaccines are produced from fertilized chicken eggs, a decades-old process that takes four to five months. The mRNA process is much faster.  Delays in producing an H1N1 vaccine spurred health officials to urge development of other technologies, according to a Government Accountability Office report.  “It’s a state-of-the-art technology — for the 1950s,” Luciana Borio, then director for medical and biodefense preparedness at the National Security Council, said at a 2018 conference on the 100th anniversary of the Spanish flu pandemic.  A New England Journal of Medicine review of the response to H1N1 found that 78 million doses of the vaccine were eventually produced for 70 countries worldwide, but only after two waves of the illness worldwide.  “The most serious operational shortcoming ... was the failure to distribute enough influenza vaccine in a timely way,” the report said. The cause: distribution problems, \"a shortfall in global vaccine-production capacity and technical delays due to reliance on viral egg cultures for production.”  Developing a vaccine is laborious, said Harvey Fineberg, a former president of the U.S. Institute of Medicine and former dean of the public-health faculty at Harvard University.  One step is confirming that a possible vaccine doesn't cause bad reactions in patients. Then scientists examine how much vaccine is required for an antibody response. And they must verify the vaccine actually protects against infection, which is why it's ideal to test during an outbreak.  All those steps come after scientists identify the genetic sequence to target for a vaccine.  “It’s like saying, 'I’ve got my architectural plans — my house must be ready to move into,'” Fineberg said. “There are a lot of things you need to do between now and being ready to open the door.”   Manufacturers work with government  The manufacturers pursuing coronavirus vaccines are working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency.  Moderna is working on 13 potential vaccines. Sanofi is working on two candidates: an mRNA candidate with the company Translate Bio and another option in collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency.  Other companies are pursuing other technologies. GlaxoSmithKline is working with China-based Clover Biopharmaceuticals through a different process to produce a cell-based vaccine.  Johnson & Johnson, which is working on several possible vaccines, announced last week it would invest $1 billion for vaccine research, development and testing. The company said it could produce 1 billion doses of a vaccine when the time comes.  Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said $3.5 billion in the coronavirus spending package will help develop manufacturing technologies to ensure a robust, agile, U.S.-based supply chain of vaccines, therapeutics, and active pharmaceutical ingredients.  “The biggest challenge we face in the United States is not developing a vaccine, tricky as that step is,” Coons said in a statement. “It’s that we lack the domestic manufacturing capacity to quickly produce a vaccine once it’s proven and deliver it to the American people.”  Lewin of Sanofi said the global health emergency spurred manufacturers to try different technologies.  “We and all the other manufacturers are working as quickly as possible to accelerate these programs while ensuring the vaccine is safe and effective,” Lewin said. “It isn’t business as usual for anybody.”  What about changes to flu vaccines?  The technology used to develop a coronavirus vaccine won’t affect the annual flu vaccine because they are different viruses requiring different approaches. But even before the pandemic, steps were underway to hasten changes to the flu vaccine.  President Donald Trump signed an executive order in September calling on manufacturers to move away from egg-based vaccines because of “critical shortcomings,” including the months they take to produce. The order anticipated a pandemic more lethal than the 1918 Spanish flu, which killed 675,000 Americans.  William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University, said one reason to change vaccine production is that growing the vaccine in eggs allows mutations that make it less effective.  “People were working on this already,” Schaffner said. “That sort of commitment, a presidential commitment, plus the moneys that go with it, really put the pedal to the metal for future research.”  Egg-based vaccine manufacturing has been reliable. Developing another process would require a multimillion-dollar investment in an industry with small profit margins, Schaffner said.  “Moving away from egg-based production is not like flipping a switch,” he said. “I’m sure all the manufacturers are all thinking about this, but how and how quickly they do it is another matter.”  Other options include cell-based and recombinant processes. A cell-based vaccine is grown in a mammal's cells, such as kidney cells from monkeys or dogs, rather than in a hen's eggs. A recombinant vaccine is created synthetically from the DNA, or genetic instructions, of a protein from the flu virus. The DNA is then combined with a baculovirus, which infects invertebrates.  Other changes could address vaccine delivery, perhaps moving from injections to pills or skin patches, Schaffner said.  A loftier goal is to develop what is called a “universal vaccine,” which could last five years at a time. Such a vaccine could be administered any time of year during a doctor's visit, rather than just in the fall.  Doing that would require changing how the vaccine attacks the flu virus, which is shaped like a sphere with lollipops protruding from it. Vaccines so far have targeted the candy at the end of the lollipop, which changes every year.  A vaccine that targets the stem of the lollipop could offer protection for years, Shaffner said. “If you get vaccinated, you’re vaccinated against a whole series of different influenza viruses,” Schaffner said.  The coronavirus pandemic has come during a severe flu season. This year’s vaccine is about as effective as usual, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study of cases through Feb. 8. The study found the severity for people up to 49 years old including hospitalizations was worse than other recent seasons, including the severe year of 2017-2018.  “Current influenza vaccines are providing substantial public health benefits,\" said the study in CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. \"However more effective vaccines are needed.\"   Contributing: Elizabeth Weise  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 20, "positive": 87, "negative": 17, "disgust": 5, "joy": 7, "anger": 9, "surprise": 1, "fear": 23, "trust": 9}, "metadata": ["vaccine", "coronavirus", "virus", "deaths", "flu", "institute", "infectious", "antibodies", "spike", "professor", "viral", "oregon", "university", "fauci", "ceo", "healthcare", "england", "global", "diseases", "johnson", "ensure", "united", "donald", "trump", "pandemic", "presidential", "options", "morbidity", "mortality"]}, {"text": "This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated.

Candice Kmetz-Parkinson is the manager of respiratory therapy at UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital.  She said patients need this machine when the lungs are no longer able to bring oxygen to the body. When a ventilator is needed, a tube is inserted into the mouth of the patient and down the windpipe.  “It’s going to inhale and exhale for you, and help work with all of the gas echange that needs to happen in the lungs,” she said.  COVID-19 patients can experience lung damage. Large numbers of them end up in the ICU and need these machines.  “For COVID patients, we’ve really seen them be on the ventilator anywhere between seven and 14 days. I would say about 10 days is probably the average,” Kmetz-Parkinson said.

In California, it's difficult to say what's happening with historically disenfranchised populations, because data is only available for around 37% of all cases, Gov. Gavin Newsom said during his Wednesday news briefing.  Of that 37% — or 6,306 of California's 16,957 total cases — 30% are Latino, 6% are black and 14% are Asian.

A dozen workers at the nursing home failed to show up for work Tuesday and only one showed up for work Wednesday, officials said. Some of the other residents were being sent to the federal medical station at the fairgrounds in Indio.

Five other employees had previously tested positive for COVID-19.  Meanwhile, a nursing home in Visalia has 44 cases, which is more than half of the city's cases, and nearly a third of Tulare County's 135 cases. A resident who died there Tuesday became the county's seventh death from coronavirus.  The rate of tuberculosis in Imperial County — the state's most impoverished county — is at 25 per 100,000 people, more than eight times the national average. That could complicate the rural region's ability to prepare for and respond to the coronavirus.  Riverside County health officials say ICU beds could be at capacity by next week, as the numbers of cases grow faster than expected.

'I would like it to go back to normal'  Keiana Flud is a senior at Rancho Bernardo High School in San Diego County. Like thousands of students across the state, the last few months of her senior year are canceled. (Photo: Contributed photo)  Keiana Flud, 17, is a senior at Rancho Bernardo High School in San Diego County. Like thousands of students across the state, she'll spend the final months of her high school career at home with her family. Her last day on campus was March 16; she figured she'd be gone maybe three weeks.  Instead, the school has closed indefinitely. With the state's expectation that coronavirus cases will peak during the last two weeks of May, it seems likely classes won't resume by June (other districts have said they'll close for the rest of the academic year).  Last week, the prom dress Keiana had ordered before sheltering in place arrived. Her mom wanted photos, so she put on the floor-length lavender gown.  In the fall, Flud plans to start at the nursing program at Cal State University in San Marcos but for now, she's wrapping up school online. We chatted by email about the experience of probably spending her last high school days social distancing.  The interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.  Q: What was the first week being away from school like? And now?  My first week of being away from school was nice because I didn't have any responsibilities, and it was nice to get away from school-related stress. Now I really miss school and my friends, and just having a daily routine.  How have you been keeping in touch with friends?  I've been keeping in touch through social media like Instagram and Snapchat.  Is there an event, in particular, you were looking forward to?  I was really looking forward to prom and our senior class Disneyland trip.  Second-semester senior year used to be a time to kind of kick back, have fun. How was yours shaping up so far?  My second semester was fairly easy. I liked being in classes with all of my senior friends and just not having so much to do.  Q: How did you think you'd be spending your last few months of high school?  I would have been at school with my friends, going to prom, going to Disneyland with the rest of the seniors, senior picnic, going to grad night and most importantly rehearsing for our graduation. I would be hanging out with my boyfriend (who I haven’t seen in person since the start of quarantine), going to the mall and out to eat. I would be hanging out with my other friends too.  I was looking forward to going to Disneyland with my boyfriend and friends because it would only be the seniors without any parents. I was looking forward to having all my friends sign my yearbook and just having the last couple weeks with all my friends and boyfriend. My sister graduated last year and I was looking forward to all the activities that she got to do.   (Photo: Getty Images)  Q: What’s been the hardest part of all of this?  A: The hardest part of this is not graduating because it is what I have been looking forward to since I was young. It has also been hard not seeing my boyfriend ... I haven’t seen him since the quarantine started.  It is hard doing home school because you don’t get the one-on-one instruction that you normally do. Also, some of the teachers don’t know how to work the computer and they aren’t teaching us like normal. It is hard being locked up with my family when usually I am out with my friends or boyfriend.  Q: So no final decision has been made on prom or graduation or senior week activities. What would you like to see happen? Like, I can imagine a Zoom graduation would be hard.  A: I would like it to go back to normal. A Zoom graduation would not be an alternative. It is not the actual thing. I wouldn’t be physically with my friends experiencing it. Maybe they could postpone graduation for the summer, so we can have that experience. I would be happy if they could postpone all senior events.  Q: What are the top two or three things you plan to do once social distancing ends? I can imagine seeing your boyfriend may be one.  A: Yes, seeing my boyfriend. Go to the beach. Eat at a restaurant with my boyfriend. Drive over to see my boyfriend. Just hang out with my friends.  Here's Keiana in her prom dress:  Keiana Flud, 17, is a senior at Rancho Bernardo High School in San Diego County. She's likely to spend her final weeks in high school social distancing.

They sounded scientific. And last week’s message from two Bakersfield doctors was exactly what many stuck-at-home Americans wanted to hear: COVID-19 is no worse than influenza, its death rates are low and we should all go back to work and school.  Drs. Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi, who own urgent care centers in the region, had called a press conference to release their conclusions about the results of 5,213 COVID-19 tests they had conducted at their centers and testing site. They claimed the results showed that the virus had spread further in the area, undetected, and thus wasn’t all that dangerous.  But public health experts were quick to debunk the doctors’ findings as misguided and riddled with statistical errors — and an example of the kind of misleading information they are forced to waste precious time disputing.  The doctors should never have assumed that the patients they tested — who came for walk-in COVID-19 tests or who sought urgent care for symptoms they experienced in the middle of a pandemic — are representative of the general population, said Dr. Carl Bergstrom, a University of Washington biologist who specializes in infectious disease modeling. He likened their extrapolations to “estimating the average height of Americans from the players on an NBA court.” And most credible studies of COVID-19 death rates in reality are far higher than the ones the doctors presented.  “They’ve used methods that are ludicrous to get results that are completely implausible,” Bergstrom said.  Still, the early media coverage went viral. A local television report on the Bakersfield doctors’ press conference garnered more than 4.3 million views on YouTube. Elon Musk, the Tesla founder who wants to reopen his Fremont manufacturing plant this week, praised the doctors to his 33 million-plus Twitter followers. Last night, the doctors got a conservative national audience for their views on Fox News, appearing on Laura Ingraham’s show.  Docs make good points https://t.co/WeXuZpMghY — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 26, 2020  In a rare statement late today, the American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine declared they “emphatically condemn the recent opinions released by Dr. Daniel Erickson and Dr. Artin Messihi. These reckless and untested musings do not speak for medical societies and are inconsistent with current science and epidemiology regarding COVID-19. As owners of local urgent care clinics, it appears these two individuals are releasing biased, non-peer reviewed data to advance their personal financial interests without regard for the public’s health.”  The doctors had set up Bakersfield’s only private walk-in COVID-19 testing site and performed about half of all tests conducted in the area. They did not respond to a CalMatters request for comment today.  Misinformation thrives in a pandemic, and public health officials in California and elsewhere just can’t keep up.  “This pandemic has been so severely politicized in this country that evidence, no matter how poor, gets amplified enormously if it benefits one side or another,” said Bergstrom, who also was one of the first experts to critique the doctors’ study on Twitter. “We always hoped this crisis wouldn’t come, but that if it did we’d all be in this together. That’s been a huge surprise for all of us doing infectious disease epidemiology. It’s amazing to have to deal with this misinformation that’s being spread around for political purposes and the ways that interferes with adequate public health response.”  California Democratic state Sen. Richard Pan, a pediatrician who chairs the Senate Health Committee, said lawmakers who favor reopening the state had not yet cited the Bakersfield doctors’ conclusions as a justification to do so. But if they did, they’d “be on pretty weak ground,” he said.  The doctors “basically hyped a bunch of data and weren’t transparent about their methods. And they really played on the fact that they’re physicians. I think it’s quite disingenuous of them.” Pan said. “Then we have to push back on any media that promotes this information. They’re really doing this as a way to fish for attention.”  A Kern County public health spokeswoman told reporters that officials did not support the doctors’ call to reopen the region. Other epidemiologists echoed that sentiment.  But already the Bakersfield doctors — who tout their support of President Donald Trump and refuse to wear masks in public — had become heroes on social platforms and conservative media outlets, with some commenters calling them “brave.” Others who support continuing to shelter-in-place described the doctors as self-promoters whose chain of urgent care centers would benefit from reopening. Non-COVID medical visits have plummeted during the pandemic, endangering the practices of many doctors.  “As struggling business owners, their economic frustration is understandable. But it can’t be mistaken for science. People trust doctors,” Michigan emergency room doctor Rob Davidson wrote on Twitter. “When they tell Fox viewers to ignore recommendations from real experts, many will believe them…The impact of rejecting science-proven recommendations in exchange for these erroneous ideas would overwhelm health systems and cost lives. While re-opening the economy might be good for their Urgent Care Centers (sic), it would kill medical personnel on the actual front lines.”  Warning: A new video making the rounds in right-wing media pushes a dangerous plan to re-open the economy. It features 2 owners of urgent care centers & is an assault on good science. They'll be on Laura Ingraham's show on Fox News tonight.

Speaking in an address to the public on Monday night Boris Johnson insisted that members of the public stay at home, outlining only a handful of exceptions.  One such exception was that members of the public were still allowed to leave their house to travel to and from, but only “where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home”.  ‘If you are working on site, you can continue to do so’  Secretary of State for Housing, Communities & Local Government Robert Jenrick went into more detail on who should and shouldn’t go into work.  He tweeted: “If you can work from home, do so.  “If you are working on site, you can continue to do so. But follow Public Health England guidance on social distancing.”  This suggests, though doesn’t explicitly state, that the likes of construction workers should continue to go to work, but maintain social distance while doing so.   What is essential work?  Last week the government announced the closure of schools to all pupils with the exceptions of children of “key workers”.  These key workers will continue to be allowed to attend work under lockdown rules, though should work from home if possible.  Who is classed as a key worker?

Education and childcare  This includes nursery and teaching staff, social workers and those specialist education professionals who must remain active during the COVID-19 response to deliver this approach.   Key public services  Which includes those essential to the running of the justice system, religious staff, charities and workers delivering key frontline services, and journalists and broadcasters who are providing public service broadcasting.   Local and national government  This only includes those administrative occupations which are essential to the effective delivery of the COVID-19 response or delivering essential public services, such as the payment of benefits.  Food and other necessary goods  Those involved in food production, processing, distribution, sale and delivery as well as those essential to the provision of other key goods.  Public safety and national security  This includes police and support staff, Ministry of Defence civilians, contractor and armed forces personnel, fire and rescue service employees, National Crime Agency staff, those maintaining border security, prison and probation staff and other national security roles.   Transport  Those who will keep the air, water, road and rail passenger and freight transport modes operating during the COVID-19 response, including those working on transport systems through which supply chains pass.  Utilities, communication and financial services  This includes staff needed for essential financial services provision, the oil, gas, electricity and water sectors, information technology and data infrastructure sector and primary industry supplies to continue during the COVID-19 response, as well as key staff working in the civil nuclear, chemicals, telecommunications, postal services and delivery, payments providers and waste disposal sectors.

Today, the World Health Organization officially announced that this is a global pandemic. We have been in frequent contact with our allies and we're marshalling the full power of the federal government and the private sector to protect the American people. This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history. I am confident that by county and continuing to take these tough measures, we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens and we will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus. From the beginning of time, nations and people have faced unforeseen challenges, including large scale and very dangerous health threats. This is the way it always was and always will be. It only matters how you respond and we're responding with great speed and professionalism. Our team is the best anywhere in the world. At the very start of the outbreak, we instituted sweeping travel restrictions on China and put in place the first federally mandated quarantined in over 50 years. we declared a public health emergency and issue the highest level of travel warning on other countries as the virus spread. It's horrible infection and taking early intense action, we have seen dramatically fewer cases of the virus in the United States that are now present in Europe. The European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots. As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seated by travelers from Europe. After consulting with our top government health professionals, I have decided to take several strong but necessary actions to protect the health and well being of all Americans. To keep new cases from entering our shores. We will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days. The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight. Thes restrictions will be adjusted, subject to conditions on the ground. There will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings, and these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval. Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing. These restrictions will also not apply to the United Kingdom. At the same time, we're monitoring the situation in China, in the South Korea, and as their situation improves, we will re evaluate the restrictions and warnings that are currently in place for a possible early opening. Earlier this week, I met with the leaders of health insurance industry who have agreed to waive all copayments for Corona virus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments and to prevent surprise medical billing, we are cutting massive amounts of red tape to make antiviral therapies available in record time. These treatments will significantly reduce the impact and reach of the virus. Additionally, last week I signed into law an $8.3 billion funding bill to help C, D. C and other government agencies fight the virus and support vaccines, treatments and distribution of medical supplies. Testing and testing capabilities are expanding rapidly day by day. We're moving very quickly. The vast majority of Americans, the risk is very, very low. Young and healthy people can expect to recover fully and quickly if they should get the virus. The highest risk is for elderly population with underlying health conditions. The elderly population must be very, very careful. In particular were strongly advising that nursing homes for the elderly suspender medically unnecessary visits. In general, older Americans should also avoid non essential travel in crowded areas. My administration is coordinating directly with communities with largest outbreaks, and we have issued guidance on school closures, social distancing and reducing large gatherings. Smart action today will prevent the spread of the virus. Tomorrow. Every community faces different risks, and it is critical for you to follow the guidelines of your local officials who are working closely with our federal health experts. And they are the best for all Americans. It is essential that everyone take extra precautions and practice good hygiene. Each of us has a role to play in defeating this virus. Wash your hands clean, often use surfaces. Cover your face and mouth if you sneeze or cough. And most of all, if you are sick or not feeling well, stay home to ensure that working Americans impacted by the virus can stay home without fear of financial hardship. I will soon be taken emergency action, which is unprecedented to provide financial relief. This will be targeted for workers who are ill quarantined or caring for others do to Corona virus. I will be asking Congress to take legislative action to extend this relief because of the economic policies that we have put into place over the last three years. We have the greatest economy anywhere in the world by far. Our banks and financial institutions are fully capitalized and incredibly strong. Our unemployment is at a historic low. This vast economic prosperity gives us flexibility, reserves and resource is toe handle any threat that comes our way. This is not a financial crisis. This is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world. However, to provide extra support for American workers, families and businesses. Tonight I am announcing the following additional actions. I am instructing the Small Business Administration to exercise available authority to provide capital and liquidity to firms affected by the Corona virus. Effective immediately, the S P A will begin providing economic loans in affected states and territories. These low interest loans will help small businesses overcome temporary economic disruptions caused by the virus. To this end, I'm asking Congress to increase funding for this program by an additional $50 billion. Using emergency authority, I will be instructing the Treasury Department to defer tax payments without interest or penalties for certain individuals and businesses negatively impacted. This action will provide more than $200 billion of additional liquidity to the economy. Finally, I am calling on Congress to provide Americans with immediate payroll tax relief. Hopefully, they will consider this very strongly. We are at a critical time in the fight against the virus. We made a life saving move with early action on China. Now we must take the same action with Europe. We will not delay. I will never hesitate to take any necessary steps to protect the lives, health and safety of the American people. I will always put the well being of America first. If we are vigilant and we can reduce the chance of infection, which we will, we will significantly impede the transmission of the virus. The virus will not have a chance against us. No nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States. We have the best economy, the most advanced healthcare and the most talented doctors, scientists and researchers anywhere in the world. We are all in this. Together we must put politics aside, stop the partisanship and unified together as one nation and one family. As history has proven time and time again, Americans always rise to the challenge and overcome adversity. Our future remains brighter than anyone can imagine. Acting with compassion and love. We will heal the sick care for those in need, help our fellow citizens and emerge from this challenge stronger and more unified than ever before. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you.

Professor Chris Whitty said that supplies have been 'tight at different times for different items' and sometimes it has been 'very, very close to the line'.  But he stressed 'at a national level we are not under water on anything' as he suggested there is enough life-saving equipment to go around.  However, he conceded there have been 'significant local pressures from time to time' in an apparent admission that some hospitals and care homes have temporarily run out of key items.  His comments at the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing came after military staff attacked the health service for the way it has been distributing the equipment.  Military personnel accused the NHS of 'appalling' handling of the issue with the army apparently pushing to be given a more prominent role in making sure gowns, gloves and face masks get to where they need to go.  They claimed NHS logistics were 'knackered' and questioned why certain items were not being rationed.  The supply of PPE has emerged as one of the key battlegrounds for the government amid fears shortages are putting frontline workers' lives at risk.  Supply did receive a boost today after an RAF plane carrying a shipment of PPE from Turkey finally arrived back in the UK, with the materials supposed to have arrived on Sunday.  Meanwhile, the government has faced accusations of being slow to take up PPE offers of help from British businesses as millions of items continue to be shipped out of the UK despite domestic need.  Labour today claimed it had been told by dozens of UK companies that offers of help on PPE had been ignored by ministers.  Professor Chris Whitty today insisted the UK does have enough PPE for frontline workers but admitted things have been 'very, very close to the line'  An RAF cargo plane arrived back from Turkey at RAF Brize Norton this morning with a cargo of PPE equipment  Prof Whitty today insisted the UK does have enough PPE but admitted there have been allocation issues which have resulted in some facilities being left without what they need.  He said: 'It is very clear that at the moment we are tight at different times for different items of PPE.  ‘It is not everything at all times, but different things at different points have been very, very close to the line.  ‘Of course, when you are close to the line, inefficiencies in any kind of part of the system tend to lead to local stock-outs so if you are very heavily overstocked that is less true and this is why the support from the armed forces has been so critical to trying to reduce this.  ‘At this point in time we are still close to the line but at a national level we are not under water on anything that I am aware of and I keep quite a close eye on this because I care very deeply about this as do all members of my profession.  ‘But of course there may be local issues and I am aware of them from my colleagues along the way and all of us want to be in a position where there is a sufficient excess over a long period of time that this can all be balanced out.’  Citing examples of hospitals and care homes sharing their resources, Prof Whitty said the UK had managed to avoid 'getting to the point where we are no longer able to cope with it'.  He said he was unable to say when the UK will have a comfortable excess supply of PPE but added: 'We have managed to keep just ahead at a national level with some significant local pressures from time to time.'  Military planners who are experts in logistics were sent out to different parts of the country by the Ministry of Defence in the early stages of the outbreak to help ensure vital supplies were appropriately and swiftly allocated.  But military sources have suggested that the NHS distribution network has seen PPE being sent to hospitals without fully taking into account need.  That has meant some hospitals have ended up with more than they need while others have been left with a shortage.  A senior army source told The Times: 'We know how knackered their [NHS logistics] systems are, but we've been surprised we've not been called in to help more, and we've been surprised by their failure to ration [kit].'  Military commanders are thought to be frustrated that the so-called Covid Support Force which can call on 10,000 personnel and has disaster response planning expertise has not been put in charge of PPE distribution.  Delayed RAF plane finally lands with PPE cargo from Turkey An RAF plane carrying a delayed consignment of PPE from Turkey finally landed in the UK this morning - but is only carrying up to half the promised 84 tonnes of life-saving equipment. Flight tracker RadarBox showed the Airbus A400-M registered ZM416 depart Istanbul and land just after 3.30am at RAF Brize Norton. The jet is one of three that have been waiting for days for the go-ahead to pick urgently needed medical clothing and equipment, including 400,000 gowns made by Turkish suppliers. It is not known how much of the consignment has arrived today, but the RAF Atlas is believed to only have capacity for 40 tonnes. After the jet touched down, three pallets were seen being unloaded onto the tarmac. The government promised that the cargo would arrive in Britain on Sunday and it when it didn't the RAF plane was sent to pick it up. It didn't land in Istanbul until Monday, at 9.10pm local time. Fury over coronavirus PPE shortages is escalating amid claims the government was ignoring offers of help from businesses - and millions of pieces of PPE are still being shipped out of the UK in spite of the lack of equipment for NHS frontline staff. Reports suggested that the government missed out on 16million facemasks for the NHS after ignoring offers from two major firms. Advertisement  A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 'The MoD understands just how challenging logistics can be, especially under current pressures.  'Of course there may be frictions at a local level, but those same armed forces are doing everything possible to support their health colleagues. The MoD has full confidence in the NHS.'  The arrival of the RAF plane back from Turkey was a welcome piece of news for ministers as they struggle to boost supply of PPE.  But they are facing domestic criticism after manufacturers suggested conversations with Whitehall about ramping up production and supply of items like gowns in the UK only started in the last two weeks.  Adam Mansell, head of the UK Fashion and Textile Association, said: 'We have started probably four weeks later than we should have.'  Reports overnight suggested the government missed out on 16 million face masks for the NHS after offers from two major firms were ignored.  The Guardian reported that infectious disease specialists Landcent said they could have delivered six million FFP2 masks for the NHS to use if the government had placed an order three weeks ago.  Volker Schuster, who owns Merseyside-based chemicals company EcoLogix, also claims he wrote to the Cabinet Office's 'COVID commercial response unit' to offer a shipment of 10 milllion FFP2 masks from China.  The firm said it only got a response eight days later - by which time the items had been sold to other countries.  Mr Schuster's local MP, Labour's Bill Esterson, confirmed he had contacted Health Secretary Matt Hancock to highlight the offer on March 27 but that he had never received a reply.  Labour today said it had been contacted by 36 British companies which had 'not received a reply' from the government after submitting offers to supply things like face guards, aprons and gowns.  Shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said in a letter to her counterpart in government Michael Gove: 'You and your officials and those at the Department for Health and Social Care will be best placed to validate what capability and capacity these firms have, but as they have not received a reply after contacting the government, I wanted to ensure that the Cabinet Office was aware of them.  'Of these firms, if just one, five or 10 were able to contribute to the national effort of ensuring that our NHS and care workers – and indeed anybody who needs to use some form of Personal Protective Equipment and clothing – could be better protected, or just one hospital or care home were able to access adequate supplies of the PPE they need, I know you will agree that that would go a long way and make a big difference.'  The Atlas A400 is spotted approaching the runway early this morning. It is only carrying up to half the promised 84 tonnes of life-saving equipment  The RAF transport plane being loaded with vital PPE equipment in Turkey which is destined for frontline healthcare workers in the UK  Mr Hancock announced yesterday at the daily Downing Street press conference that 8,331 companies had come forward with offers of PPE - some of which had led to 'very large-scale' purchases.  'I am very grateful to all of those who have come forward and we are now actively engaged with hundreds of these companies,' he said.  'I can announce that we are working with 159 potential UK manufacturers which are starting to come on stream.'  Mr Hancock said the government needed to carefully consider all of the offers made to make sure firms can actually deliver on what they have promised.  'We have had some offers, for instance, that have come from companies where, upon investigation, the company has only just been formed in the previous day or two before coming and asking for a cash deal with the government,' he said.  The RAF plane carrying supplies from Turkey is believed to only have been stocked with up to half of the promised 84 tonnes of life-saving equipment ordered from Istanbul.  The delay in the arrival of the cargo had been blamed by the UK government on problems in Turkey.  But Turkish officials hit back and said there had been no hold up on their end, claiming ministers had only requested help with the shipment on Sunday.  The government is insistent that it is pursuing 'every possible option' to secure additional kit but unprecedented worldwide demand means the situation is 'very challenging'.

Beijing has been bending over backward trying to convince the world that the United States is the real culprit behind the quickly spreading virus that's already claimed more than 4,600 lives across the globe.  It's a high-stakes strategy for the Asian nation fighting to keep its superpower status amid a national lockdown and palpable anger over claims that Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus, at first covered it up, triggering a worldwide health and economic crisis.  WHO DECLARES CORONAVIRUS GLOBAL 'PANDEMIC'  The Chinese government has already published a book in English -- with translations in the works in French, Spanish, Russian and Arabic -- touting its handling of the deadly disease.  \"A Battle Against Epidemic: China Combatting COVID-19 in 2020\" is a mishmash of glowing state media reports on the accomplishments of President Xi Jinping, the Communist Party and the dominance of the Chinese system in fighting the crisis.  At best, China's aggressive new campaign can be chalked up to ambitious propaganda. At its worst, it's a reckless display from a country that has actively misled the world while working overtime to save its own skin, foreign affairs expert Gordon G. Chang told Fox News.  Chang believes Beijing has been laying the groundwork for a PR attack against the United States for more than a month, first by throwing doubt on the origin of COVID-19 and second, by slamming America's handling of previous diseases like the swine flu, which decimated China's pork industry.  CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE  On Thursday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian tweeted that the U.S. military might have brought the coronavirus to Wuhan.  “When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!” Zhao said.  A few days earlier, Lin Songtian, China's ambassador to South Africa, said: \"Although the epidemic first broke out in China, it did not necessarily mean that the virus is originated from China, let alone 'made in China.'\"  Vague and misleading statements like the one from Lin are ripped right out of China's propaganda playbook and attempt to sow doubt about the global crisis.  Chinese officials have also pushed back on the expression \"Wuhan coronavirus\" -- saying the name used frequently by U.S. conservative commentators unfairly stigmatizes the world's most populous country.  CORONAVIRUS FEARS HIT FEVER PITCH AMID NEW TRAVEL BAN; PANDEMIC SENDS WALL STREET, NBA, HOLLYWOOD REELING  Chang said it's just another tactic in China's playbook, carefully choreographed to make Americans look petty and racist.  \"This an all-out assault on the United States,\" Chang said.  In December, when the coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan, many media around the world began referring to it as the \"Wuhan virus.\" But last month, the World Health Organization renamed the illness COVID-19 so as not to link it to a specific location or group of people.  The name change didn't stop some, like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who blew past warnings and deliberately referred to it as the \"Wuhan virus\" after China's foreign ministry called it \"highly irresponsible\" to do so.  President Donald Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, went even further Wednesday.  “Unfortunately, rather than using best practices, this outbreak in Wuhan was covered up,\" O'Brien said at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative-leaning think tank in Washington. \"There's lots of open-source reporting from China, from Chinese nationals, that the doctors involved were either silenced or put in isolation, or that sort of thing, so that the word of this virus could not get out. It probably cost the world community two months.\"  O'Brien said if experts would have had those two months to get ahead of the spread of the virus, \"I think we could have dramatically curtailed what happened both in China and what's now happening across the world.\"  Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said the Communist Party is pointing the finger at the U.S. so it can dampen discontent back home.  “The Chinese military portal Xilu.com recently published an article baselessly claiming that the virus is ‘a biochemical weapon produced by the U.S. to target China,’\" Rubio said.  Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton, has frequently used the term \"Wuhan virus\" on the Senate floor.  Earlier this week, several social media users took House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., to task when he referred to it as \"the Chinese coronavirus.\"  MCCARTHY KNOCKS DEMS AFTER THEY CLAIM SAYING 'CHINESE CORONAVIRUS' IS RACIST  Instead of backing down, Chang believes officials should keep calling COVID-19 the \"Wuhan virus\" and push back on accusations of racism.  \"This isn't a Republican thing. We all need to unite and for people to say, 'this is racist' is irresponsible,\" Chang said. \"There is no race known as Wuhanese.\"  Chang also said calling COVID-19 the \"Wuhan virus\" or \"Chinese coronavirus\" keeps pressure on the Chinese government and forces it to be held accountable by the rest of the world for its initial response to the global crisis, which was widely regarded as abysmal.  China, though, is using everything in its arsenal to paint itself as a global hero, rewriting history and going so far as to demand a thank you for containing the virus as long as it did.  \"We should say righteously that the U.S. owes China an apology, the world owes China a thank you,\" an editorial on state news agency Xinhua read.  CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP  Also peculiar is that Beijing -- which is normally quick to censor news -- has refused to step in as a wave of anti-American conspiracy theories flood the internet. Among the rumors is that the U.S. created the coronavirus to make China look bad as well as one that accuses the government of covering up thousands of deaths by classifying them as the regular flu.  \"It's more than just some disinformation or an official narrative,\" Xiao Qiang, an adjunct professor at the University of California at Berkeley's Schools of Information, told The Washington Post. \"It's an orchestrated, all-out campaign by the Chinese government through every channel at a level you rarely see.

The warnings came in more than a dozen of briefing papers called the President Daily Brief, the Washington Post reported Monday, adding to a growing body of news accounts and reports of the botched and delayed response of the Trump administration to the epidemic.  The first mention of the virus in the PBD came in early January.  According to the report, by Tuesday morning, four months after, it had killed 52,256 — 1,378 in just the past 24 hours — and infected 988,490, up by 22,412 over the previous day.  These intelligence alerts, the newspaper reported, failed to register on the President who tends to skip the daily briefings and does not pay much attention to the oral summaries he prefers two or three times a week.  The first major action taken by the Trump administration to fight the outbreak came in late-January with a ban on travelers from China, except US citizens. But the administration did do much for all of February, a period of squandered opportunity to beef up essential medical supplies, protective equipment and begin social-distancing and other mitigation efforts.  The president continued to play down the gravity of the crisis. “It’s like a miracle, it will disappear,” he said February 26. “Just stay calm. It will go away,” he said on March 10, the day before the WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic, as the Post report noted as an instance of the president’s failure to grasp the seriousness of the situation.  The president has insisted, however, that there was no delay in his response to the crisis and has cited the January travel ban as the highlight of his administration’s response.

Many states are delaying non-essential medical care to devote resources to the virus outbreak, but abortion facilities have been continuing their business as usual. Abortion activists insist that abortion are essential medical care, even though they destroy unborn babies’ lives and put mothers at risk.  Though many abortion facilities remain open, abortion activists are using the crisis to push for even more abortions through de-regulation. Recently, a number of abortion activists urged the Trump administration to allow mail-order and telemedicine abortions, according to Vice.  On Friday, Trump declared a national emergency and allowed for the expansion of telemedicine (meeting doctors over a webcam rather than in-person, when possible) to prevent further spread of the virus.  Abortion activists argued that he could do the same for abortions.  Here’s more from the report:  While telemedicine abortion specifically enables providers to prescribe abortion pills from a distance, longstanding federal regulations require that clinics dispense mifepristone, one of the two drugs commonly used together in medication abortions, in person—meaning the drugs can’t be picked up at a pharmacy or sent in the mail. An abortion patient can choose to take their medication at home, but they can’t get it without leaving their home. These federal rules prevent people from staying home and flattening the pandemic curve, an action that saves lives. … During the COVID-19 pandemic, HHS Secretary Alex Azar could perhaps apply Trump’s telehealth mandate to medication abortion by directing the FDA to eliminate or relax its regulations, and allow pregnant people to consult with their providers virtually and obtain mifepristone via their pharmacy or in the mail. HHS’ press office didn’t respond to VICE’s requests for comment about encouraging the FDA to take action on mifepristone.  Follow LifeNews.com on Instagram for pro-life pictures and videos.  But the goal is different. With basic telemedicine, the purpose is to save more lives; expanding telemedicine abortions would do the opposite. The Food and Drug Administration appeared to recognize this when it confirmed to Vice that abortion drugs will not be de-regulated because of the coronavirus.  “Certain restrictions, known as a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), are necessary for mifepristone when used for medical termination of early pregnancy in order to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks,” its Office of Media Affairs told the pro-abortion news outlet.  Mifepristone is not safe for the mother or her unborn child. The abortion drugs have been linked to at least 24 women’s deaths and 4,000 serious complications. Additionally, the illegal, online sales of abortion drugs have been linked to forced abortions. A New York City woman is facing charges after she allegedly sold abortion drugs to a man accused of trying to force his girlfriend to take them.  Risks of mifepristone and misoprostol, the most common abortion drugs taken together to abort and then expel an unborn baby from the womb, include excessive bleeding, severe abdominal pain, infection, hemorrhage and death.  Right now, 18 states ban telemedicine abortions precisely because they are dangerous. Requiring that a woman meet with a doctor prior to the abortion can be life-saving. Women may learn information that changes their minds about their unborn babies, or the doctor may find health complications, such as an ectopic pregnancy, that could be deadly if the woman takes the drugs.  Pro-life advocates also have strong concerns that, without basic regulations in place, abortion drugs could be misused by abusive men who want to force women to abort their unborn babies.

They come for the soft powder, stay for the parties at top-class restaurants and pump money into an otherwise remote wilderness region where the howl of wolves echoes through the night.  But this year, somewhere between the lifts and the lodge, the tourists left behind something else: a deadly virus.  Now the valley is a coronavirus hot spot, registering one of the highest infection rates per capita in the country. With 148 cases in a county of just 22,000 people – including two deaths – the share of the population testing positive is greater than even in New York City.   Advertisement  The impact has been dramatic: The small hospital in Ketchum, the region’s hub, has partially shut down after four of its seven emergency doctors were quarantined. Patients are being ferried to facilities hours away. The fire department is relying on fresh-faced volunteers, trained in a day, to drive ambulances.  Everyone in town knows someone who has fallen ill.  The coronavirus “tore through this valley like a wildfire,” said Brent Russell, one of the emergency room doctors.  “I would say about a quarter of the people I know here have symptoms consistent with covid,” he added, referring to the disease caused by the coronavirus.  Russell, 50, would normally be treating them. But he was one of the first in the region to come down with the virus. After an agonizing three and a half weeks – including nights when he woke up barely able to breathe – Russell is only now returning to work to help cope with the ever-growing influx of new patients.  Along with a handful of other ski hubs in the western United States, the Wood River Valley – whose population density is about 3,000 times less than New York City’s – offers a preview of what happens when the novel coronavirus escapes cities and attacks rural America.   Advertisement  Although scarcely populated areas offer some protection for a virus that thrives on social contact, they are hardly immune. And once infection creeps in, the effect in rural communities could be more severe given threadbare health systems, long distances to hospitals and elderly populations.  “The epidemic hasn’t really hit many rural communities yet. But it will. And they know that if it does hit them, it’s going to hit them harder,” said Olugbenga Ajilore, a senior economist at the Center for American Progress.  The vast majority of America’s coronavirus patients remain clustered in and around cities. That’s where the disease got its start in the United States, as infected visitors arrived from abroad.  But there are few areas – even remote ones – that remain untouched by the coronavirus as it continues its relentless spread.  Montana and North Dakota recently recorded their first coronavirus deaths. In Washington state on Monday, Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee noted a “disturbing” pattern of rural counties that had recorded remarkably high positive test rates – including one that was up to 21%. In rural Alabama, meanwhile, residents are bracing for bigger outbreaks of a virus that “could pop up anywhere,” said Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., who represents a wide, thinly populated region in the northern half of the state.  When it does, he said, he fears an impact that “exposes the vulnerabilities in all of rural America,” including underfunded health systems and patchy broadband networks.  For now, at least, the virus’s early forays into the countryside have come with a silver lining: They’re hitting areas that are better able to withstand them than most.   Advertisement  Some of the worst affected areas, per capita, are recreation centers renowned for their natural beauty that attract large numbers of tourists and have thrived during the past decade of economic growth. The counties surrounding Vail and Crested Butte in Colorado and Park City in Utah – skiing meccas, all – have seen especially high concentrations of patients.  So has Blaine County, home to the Sun Valley ski resort, the city of Ketchum and Idaho’s largest coronavirus outbreak. Many celebrities have second homes in the region. The skiing is reputed to be some of the best in the country, and it’s a top destination on the conference circuit.  But the same factors that have helped the region thrive have also made it vulnerable to the coronavirus.  “We were doing so well, with lots of tourism,” said Scott Mason, who owns three restaurants in Ketchum. “But that’s why we’re getting so hard hit now.”  The area is particularly popular among tourists from Seattle, with direct flights to the small regional airport. Health experts say visitors from the area with the nation’s first coronavirus outbreak probably brought it to Idaho in the early days of the pandemic, before states and municipalities nationwide began to implement extreme restrictions intended to slow the spread.  Russell, the doctor, said he believes he contracted the virus before there were any confirmed cases in Idaho. An avid skier, he said innocuous-seeming conversations with visitors may have been the culprit.  “People think that skiing is a low-risk activity,” he said. “But you’re on a chairlift for two-thirds of the time, and you’re turning to face people to talk to them.”  Blaine County had its first two positive test results on March 14.  Sun Valley – the region’s major ski resort – announced the next day that it was closing for the season, weeks earlier than planned. The day after, Ketchum Mayor Neil Bradshaw did something he never thought he would: He wrote an open letter telling tourists to stay away.  “For a town used to welcoming visitors, that is hard to do,” he acknowledged in his piece for the Idaho Mountain Express . “But we must reduce the number of people visiting our area. . . . The message is clear: This is not a place for a virus vacation.”  The city immediately began to clear out. Hotels emptied. Restaurants shuttered.  “Normally, we’d be bustling,” Bradshaw said in an interview. “It’s very much a ghost town right now.”  But it was too late. At Blaine County’s only hospital, the 25-bed St. Luke’s Wood River Medical Center, the virus had hit the staff hard. Two emergency doctors, Russell included, tested positive. Two others were believed to have been exposed and were in quarantine.  Without enough staff to keep the hospital running at full strength, administrators decided to transfer patients to other facilities and halt inpatient services.  Because nearby areas of Idaho are still relatively unaffected, it’s a strategy that’s working – for now.  “If the rest of the state were as hard hit as we are, we’d be in a real disaster here. It would be like Italy,” Russell said.  Even with those additional resources, the health system is under strain. Bill McLaughlin, the local fire chief, said about 10% of first responders have tested positive for covid-19. With patients being transported as far away as Boise – a five- or six-hour round-trip – he has had to sign up and train volunteer ambulance drivers in as little as a day to keep the system running.  All the while, there’s the personal toll.  In a city like Ketchum – population 2,700 – the impact of so many people falling ill at once has been deeply personal.  “Everybody here knows somebody who has gotten sick, or in some cases, has passed away,” McLaughlin said.  “It’s not six degrees of separation,” Bradshaw said. “It’s one degree.”  There’s also the impact on livelihoods. Tourists may have brought the coronavirus to the region. But without them, the local economy falls apart.  Mason, the restaurant owner, was cleaning the kitchen at the Ketchum Grill by himself one recent afternoon, with only the occasional to-go order to tend to. This time of year, his three restaurants would normally be packed. But with so little food to serve, he has gone from about 80 employees to just 11.  “The numbers are drastic,” said Mason, who opened his first restaurant in the city 29 years ago. “Right now, we’re losing money. We’ll do what we can, but this can’t go on for months and months.”  Authorities say they don’t know if the worst of the pandemic has passed or if it’s still to come. But they say they are heartened by the fact that the community appears to be rallying together. Social distancing rules are being followed. People are volunteering to help. The tourists, everyone seems convinced, will one day return.  And each night, at 8 p.m., the region puts its own spin on a global phenomenon of breaking the isolation and thanking health-care workers – not with pots and pans or cheers or a song. But with a howl.  “The whole valley,” Russell said, “lets out a giant wolf roar.”   Get Boston.com's e-mail alerts:  Sign up and receive coronavirus news and breaking updates, from our newsroom to your inbox.

Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.  AUBURN, Ala. – With recent cases of animals being found to have the COVID-19 disease, people have a lot of questions about coronavirus and their household pets.  In a news release from the university on Monday, Dr. Ellen Behrend, the acting director of Auburn University’s Veterinary Teaching Hospitals and the Joezy Griffin Professor in the College of Veterinary Medicine’s Department of Clinical Sciences, broke down recent news about pets infected with COVID-19 and offered best practices for keeping pets and people healthy during the pandemic.  Can pets become infected with COVID-19?  Three pets outside of the U.S. have tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 and all lived with humans that also tested positive, Behrend said. Of the three positive cases of suspected human-to-animal transmission, the two dogs never showed any symptoms of COVID-19 and never became sick. The third, and most recent positive COVID-19 result in a pet, is a cat in Belgium that developed gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms about one week after the owner began showing symptoms of COVID-19. It is not known if the virus found in any of these animals was alive or dead, or if the cat coincidentally tested positive for the coronavirus while sick with another problem that caused the symptoms.  Over the weekend, a tiger at New York’s Bronx Zoo tested positive as well. It is also not clear if animals are able to transmit the virus, or if they are merely carriers. Behrend said they do know that positive tests are neither concerning nor surprising based on previous infectious disease behavior in humans and animals. More research is needed before reliable determinations can be made about human-to-animal and animal-to-human COVID-19 transmission, she said.  Most importantly, she said it is yet another reason to prioritize basic infection control measures, like washing hands after interaction with pets and physically distancing yourself as you would a person you are living with.  How should I care for my pet if I become infected with COVID-19?  If you test positive for COVID-19, let your doctor know that you have pets in your home. Behrend said. Contact with animals should be restricted while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would distance yourself from other people.  When possible, another member of your household should care for the pets and you should avoid unnecessary contact with your pets. If you have tested positive and are the only person available to care for your pet or service animal, Berhend said you should take care to wash your hands before and after caring for the animal and, if possible, wear a face mask while interacting until you are medically cleared to return to your normal activities.  What do I do if I become infected and my pet gets sick?  If your pet begins to show some symptoms of COVID-19, contact your veterinarian for advice. If you become infected and your pet gets sick also, Behrend says keep the animal in the house, isolate the pet from people and other animals and practice good hygiene when interacting with your pet — limit touching, don’t snuggle, don’t put your face near your pet’s face, wash your hands afterwards, etc. Be careful with your pets, Behrend said – practice some distancing and extra hygiene until you are both healthy, but do not abandon them.  Can animal vaccines protect me against COVID-19?  According to Behrend, the short answer is “no.” There are coronavirus vaccines made for animals, but they do not protect against the specific type of coronavirus that causes COVID-19.  What are best practices for keeping my pets healthy?  Use the same distancing practices for your pets as you use for yourself, Behrend said. Limit contact with people, especially people with fever or respiratory symptoms. Don’t take pets into crowded areas and maintain a distance from others when walking your dog. If a place is safe for you, it should be safe for your pets.  Where can I find information about COVID-19 and my pets?  Behrend suggests the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website at www.cdc.gov and the American Veterinary Medical Association website at www.avma.org for accurate, up-to-date pet-related information about COVID-19.

Ifeanyi, who is the National Publicity Secretary, Association of Medical Laboratory Scientists of Nigeria, AMLSN, decried what he described as lack of performance indicators in the President’s lockdown extension speech.  His words: “Before now, we had expected an extension, Nigerians are not bothered about the extension, they are bothered that the extension should have performance indicators. In the last lockdown, we had no measurable indicators. they only told us a narrative of what transpired the last two weeks.  “They are asking us to lockdown again in the FCT, Lagos, Ogun, and others. But we are saying that you should tell us five objectives that at the end of the two weeks we can relate to.”   Daily testing capacity  On the issue of the nation’s daily testing capacity, Ifeanyi stated: “While I commend the President for what he has done, I beg to differ with the text of his address that says we can now do 1,500 tests per day.  We started in February and between the last week in February and the 12th of April, we were only able to do between 3000-5000 tests, so what magic wand has happened that can now make us deliver 1,500 tests per day?”  Further, Ifeanyi said: “If you listened to the Minister of Health today (Monday) and the National Coordinator PTF-COVID, Dr. Sani Aliu, they talked about how they have increased the number of labs to 11, but they were talking about being able to test samples sufficiently to fill those labs meaning, therefore, that there is a major lag on sampling processes and sample volume.  “So where is the sample volume coming from that gives us 1, 500 per day? Yes, we may have infrastructure that can deliver 1, 500 per day but that does not translate that we are now testing 1,500 per day,” he argued.   Hazard allowances  Ifeanyi also lamented the silence on the issue of hazard allowance for health workers.  “My major worry is about the controversies arising from the hazard allowance for frontline health workers particularly medical lab scientists.  The President is yet to get the PTF-COVID, the Ministry of Health, or the National Salaries and Wages Commission to be categorical as per what frontline health workers should get as hazard allowance.  “The President’s address did not speak to it, it only said that the package would is being developed, but we want to know, because they have patriotically shown commitment and call to duty, to protect their fatherland.  “We expect that with provisions being made amply for the NCDC, the PTF-COVID and the N500 million stimulus, those who are on the frontline must have insurance taken out for them and good hazard allowance paid out to them on a flat rate particularly medical lab scientists that are involved in contact tracing, testing, and sampling.  These are huge risk ventures. They have put themselves in harm’s way and the President, beyond words of appreciation, should give something tangible to support them.”   Lockdown palliatives  On the issue of palliatives, Ifeanyi argued that they were being politicised.  “We are still politicising the palliatives, there is nothing concrete for people and we have seen what happened over the last two weeks. “Nigerians are disappointed that the palliatives are shrouded in some form of controversy.  It does appear that the very poor are getting anything. Those that eke a living daily as recognised have nothing to look forward to. I just pray that armed robbery, banditry, and criminality are not going to take a high point in the next two weeks.   Training of health workers  On the claim by the federal government that it has trained 7,000 health workers, Ifeanyi disagreed.  “That I do not agree with, it is very doubtful. We volunteered 170 medical laboratory scientists, till date, as those in the apex of professional leadership in a medical laboratory in Nigeria, none of our members have been contacted for any form of training.  “Even those that we submitted their details as volunteers are yet to be reached out to.  All I know is that not more about 50 medical lab scientists were trained in the FCT and even afterward, they are yet to get good support for the work they are doing at the international press centre, so the training they are talking we do not know where it took place, those managing the president and giving feedback should know that they will give account on the day.   vanguard   Kindly Share This Story:  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 21, "positive": 17, "negative": 3, "joy": 2, "anger": 4, "fear": 7, "trust": 5}, "metadata": ["lockdown", "indicators", "scientist", "minister", "samples", "infrastructure", "frontline", "ministry", "commitment"]}, {"text": "NEW YORK — New York City’s death toll from the coronavirus has been disproportionately high in black and Hispanic communities, and the city is starting an outreach campaign for those residents, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday.  “We’re seeing folks who have struggled before really being hit particularly hard,” de Blasio said at a City Hall briefing.  Preliminary data indicates that black people account for 28% of the city’s COVID-19 death toll, even though they are just 22% of the city’s population. Hispanic people account for 34% of the city’s virus death toll and 29% of its population.  De Blasio said of the racial disparities: “It’s sick. It’s troubling. It’s wrong. And we are going to fight back with everything we’ve got.”  Dr. Oxiris Barbot, the city’s health commissioner, noted that the communities that have been hit the hardest by the virus “have had higher rates of underlying chronic illness” than other New Yorkers.  State health officials reported Wednesday that nearly 4,600 people have been killed by the virus in New York City. The city’s new round of data is based on a smaller number of cases, about 1,600, where the race and ethnicity of the victim is known.  De Blasio said the city would embark on a multimillion-dollar public service campaign to reach non-English speaking communities with information about the virus. The state also announced an awareness campaign to include hard-to-reach communities.  Cuomo, speaking separately later in the day, said he was troubled by the disparities and will order more testing in minority communities.  “Why is it the poorest people always pay the highest price?” Cuomo asked. “But let’s figure it out. Let’s do the work. Let’s do the research. Let’s learn from this moment.”  When the city fatality figures are adjusted to reflect the age makeup of ethnic groups within the city’s population, the disparities are more stark. The age-adjusted death rate for both blacks and Hispanics was more than double the rate for non-Hispanic whites.  Asians, meanwhile, experienced a much lower rate of fatalities: 8.4 per 100,000 residents, compared with 10.2 for non-Hispanic whites, 19.8 for non-Hispanic blacks and 22.8 for Hispanics.  Although the figures released Wednesday show racial disparities in who has died of the virus, the disparities are not as great as those that have been reported elsewhere in the country.

It will run through 2030.  Under the new agreement, the regular season will be extended by one game, to 17, effective as early as the 2021 season. The playoffs will be enlarged from 12 teams to 14, effective as early as this coming season.  The salary cap for teams is increased by $10 million to $198.2 million. Overall player costs per club, which includes benefits and the performance-based pay pool, are increased to $242.9 million. Not shabby.  There will be plenty of discussion of the pros and cons of adding another regular season game and expanding the playoff field. But not in this post. Rather, I want to discuss the possible impact of the Wuhan coronavirus on the players’ decision to approve the new CBA.  The vote was close — 1019-959. According to Mike Florio of ProFootballTalk, there was a marked difference between votes cast early in the voting period and votes cast after the coronavirus crisis seemed to deepen:  As one source said, based on communications with multiple players (some of whom had in turn communicated with multiple players), the vote was “definitely failing” until the COVID-19 crisis sparked a stock-market crash and demonstrated conclusively that the “fear of what may happen” (which some who opposed the CBA cited derisively) is a real and legitimate factor in matters of this nature. Broncos kicker Brandon McManus, the team’s NFLPA representative, told Mike Klis of 9News.com that McManus believes recent events saved the CBA.  Florio concludes that without Thursday’s stock market crash, “the NFL and NFLPA could have been sliding toward a work stoppage in 2021.”  I don’t think the evidence enables us to say more than “could have been.” But the events of last week have provided many of us with an enhanced appreciation of normal life in America. It’s comforting to suppose that NFL players are among those who have gained this appreciation, even if it is mostly appreciation of a normal stock market.

In the years between two lethal pandemics, one the misnamed Spanish flu, the other COVID-19, the world learned about viruses, cured various diseases, made effective vaccines, developed instant communications and created elaborate public-health networks.  Yet here we are again, face-masked to the max. And still unable to crush an insidious yet avoidable infectious disease before hundreds of thousands die from it.  As in 1918, people are again hearing hollow assurances at odds with the reality of hospitals and morgues filling up and bank accounts draining. The ancient common sense of quarantining is back. So is quackery: Rub raw onions on your chest, they said in 1918. How about disinfectant in your veins now? mused President Donald Trump, drawing gasps instead of laughs over what he weakly tried to pass off as a joke.  In 1918, no one had a vaccine, treatment or cure for the great flu pandemic as it ravaged the world and killed more than 50 million people. No one has any of that for the coronavirus, either.  Modern science quickly identified today’s new coronavirus, mapped its genetic code and developed a diagnostic test, tapping knowledge no one had in 1918. That has given people more of a fighting chance to stay out of harm’s way, at least in countries that deployed tests quickly, which the U.S. didn’t.  But the ways to avoid getting sick and what to do when sick are little changed. The failure of U.S. presidents to take the threat seriously from the start also joins past to present.  Trump all but declared victory before infection took root in his country and he's delivered a stream of misinformation ever since. President Woodrow Wilson's principal failure was his silence.  Not once, historians say, did Wilson publicly speak about a disease that was killing Americans grotesquely and in huge numbers, even though he contracted it himself and was never the same after. Wilson fixated on America's parallel fight in World War I like “a dog with a bone,” says John M. Barry, author of “The Great Influenza.”  The suspected ground zero of the Spanish flu ranges from Kansas to China. But it was clear to U.S. officials even in 1918 that it didn't start in Spain.  The pandemic took on Spain's name only because its free press ambitiously reported the devastation in the disease's early 1918 wave while government officials and a complicit press in countries at war — the U.S. among them — played it down in a time of jingoism, censorship and denial.  Like COVID-19, the 1918 pandemic came from a respiratory virus that jumped from animals to people, was transmitted the same way, and had similar pathology, Barry said by email. Social distancing, hand-washing and masks were leading control measures then and now.  Medical advice from then also resonates today: “If you get it, stay at home, rest in bed, keep warm, drink hot drinks and stay quiet until the symptoms are past,\" said Dr. John Dill Robertson, Chicago health commissioner in 1918. \"Then continue to be careful, for the greatest danger is from pneumonia or some kindred disease after the influenza is gone.”  In the manner of the day, there just had to be a catchy rhyme in circulation, too: “Cover up each cough and sneeze. If you don’t you’ll spread disease.”  But there were also marked differences between the viruses of 1918 and 2020. The Spanish flu was particularly dangerous to healthy people aged 20 to 40 — the prime generation of military service — paradoxically because of their vibrant immune systems.  When such people got infected, their antibodies went after the virus like soldiers spilling from the trenches of Europe's killing fields.  “The immune system was throwing every weapon it had at the virus,” Barry said. \"The battlefield was the lung. The lung was being destroyed in that battle.”  Young soldiers and sailors massed at military camps in the U.S., sailed for Europe on ships stuffed to the gunwales with humanity, fought side by side in the trenches and came home in victory to adoring crowds. The toll was enormous, on them and the people they infected. The Spanish flu could just as easily have been called the U.S. Army or U.S. Navy flu instead. Or the German or British flu, for that matter.  Among those who died in the pandemic was Friedrich Trump, Donald Trump's paternal grandfather. Among those who contracted it and recovered were the wartime leaders of Britain and Germany as well as of the United States, British and Spanish kings and the future U.S. president, Franklin Roosevelt, when he was assistant Navy secretary.  But the toll was heavier on average people and the poor, crowded in tenements, street cars and sweaty factories.  They could not all live by the words of the 1918 U.S. surgeon general, Rupert Blue: “Keep out of crowds and stuffy places as much as possible. ... The value of fresh air through open windows cannot be overemphasized. ... Make every possible effort to breath as much pure air as possible.”  An estimated 675,000 Americans died in the pandemic, which is thought to have infected one-third of the global population. Tracking by Johns Hopkins University shows the continuing COVID-19 pandemic has killed more than 250,000 people globally, more than 68,000 in the United States.   ___   BAD SCIENCE  In 1918, the surgeon general noted in a handbill that “a person who has only a mild attack of the disease himself may give a very severe attack to others.\" The warning is just as applicable to the coronavirus, especially as scientists learned large numbers of people with COVID-19 may spread it despite no obvious symptoms. Exactly how often the new virus kills can’t be determined without better counts of the infected; some estimates put the 1918 flu’s death rate at 2.5%.  Blue's public notice also warned people to avoid charlatans and only get medicine from doctors.  Physicians, though, didn't always know what they were doing. Medical journals at the time describe a rash of unusual treatments, some in the league of Trump's amateur theories about disinfectant, blasts of lights and an unapproved drug that has both potential benefits and risks.  One 1918-era doctor recommended that people sniff a boric acid and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) powder to rinse out nasal passages. Others prescribed quinine, strychnine and a poisonous garden plant called Digitalis to help circulation, as well as drugs derived from iodine for “internal disinfection,” according to Laura Spinney, who wrote the 2017 book “Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How it Changed the World.”  Popular theories spread that warming your feet would prevent infection, or gobbling brown sugar, or getting the onion rubdown. A “clean heart” was one supposed preventive, though it is not clear whether that meant the organ or the heart of love.  “There was no Tony Fauci back then,\" Barry said in a remote Library of Congress interview in April.  We have Fauci now — a federal immunologist who has been regarded as the truth-teller in White House briefings, singularly immune to Trump's positive spin and falsehoods. Plus, we know so much more than people did in 1918.  Yet we're still hearing lots of Dark Ages nonsense.  Conspiracy theorists have blamed COVID-19 on the development of 5G networks, just as they say radio waves caused the 1918 flu. Arsonists recently torched more than a dozen British cell towers after that falsehood circulated.  Over the months of this pandemic, The Associated Press has debunked a series of bogus remedies that spread on Facebook, Twitter and the like. No, blasting hot air up your nose from a hair dryer won't protect you. Nor will drinking tonic water, eating high-alkaline foods, stuffing antibiotic ointment up your nose, downing vodka or any home elixir.  No, it's not true that if you can't hold your breath very long, you have COVID-19. Or that a vaccine from a lab only works on a disease created by a lab.  Social distancing has not come with social-media distancing. Over a century of science, we haven't gone back to the future, but ahead to the past.   ___  LESSONS OF 1918 (and 1919)  In September 1918, as the Spanish flu's second and by far deadliest wave hit in the U.S., Philadelphia's public health chief disregarded advisers and let a massive war-bond parade proceed through downtown. The H1N1 virus raced through the masses in what has been called the world's deadliest parade. As officials insisted there was nothing to be alarmed about, people were seeing neighbours sicken and die with astonishing speed and mass graves being dug.  “It's just the flu\" had worn thin as the mantra of officialdom.  Late that November, sirens wailed in San Francisco to sound the all-clear after six weeks of lockdown and tell people they could remove their masks. San Francisco, like many cities in the West, had been largely spared the first wave and spent the interval preparing for Round 2, mandating masks and jailing people who didn't comply.  They had a rhyme for that, too, of course: \"Obey the laws, and wear the gauze. Protect your jaws from septic paws.”  The precautions paid off with a death rate lower than in afflicted cities elsewhere. But the city relaxed too soon.  In December, thousands of new cases erupted. A wave spilling into the new year was underway. San Francisco's death toll mounted by more than 1,000. It was the last lashing by the Spanish flu, and a less lethal one.  The brutal lessons of 1918 and 1919? To Barry, who was enlisted 15 years ago in a Bush administration drive to prepare all levels of government for pandemics, they are to respond early, relax cautiously, tell people the truth.  Instead he has seen denial followed by a chaotic federal response and leadership vacuum as Washington and the states compete for the same medical essentials and now move fitfully toward reopening.  “Now we have plans, even war-gamed the plans, spent billions preparing for just what is happening, federal agencies have been tasked to handle all these things, and we get ... next to nothing,” he said.

The contagion has moved at the speed of a vast and restless public, while the bureaucracies of government and science have struggled to keep up. Political efforts to control the story, rather than the disease, allowed the virus to attain pandemic proportions. As is always the case in the age of the rant, scapegoating and finger-pointing have often drowned out technical discussions. Bizarre and probably dangerous remedies have propagated on the web. A babble of panicked voices, contradictory assessments, and institutional warnings have made it difficult to know who speaks with authority on the subject.  In a sense, the trajectory of COVID-19 has been typical of our times: a tsunami of information has overwhelmed the institutions charged with prevention and control. The confusion, this time, touches on matters of life and death. That difference will have a bearing on the future of the institutions involved.  The new strain of coronavirus first appeared in early December in the city of Wuhan, China. The perverse relationship between China’s rulers and information made a wider outbreak inevitable. Certain Western intellectuals, troubled by the chaos of democracy, have recommended Chinese methods of governance as a model for the future. China is thought to have tamed the digital netherworld and turned technology to the cause of stability and progress.  A tsunami of information has overwhelmed the institutions charged with prevention and control.  In truth, the regime is a relic of the last century and a prisoner to obsolete notions of control. Communist Party mandarins still believe that what is known can be subtracted from what is revealed—and, crucially in this case, that what is revealed can be decided from the top. The country is thus a kingdom of lies, in which local officials seek to deceive their provincial masters, provincial officials seek to deceive the national leadership, and national leaders, in turn, hope to deceive the public.  The reflexive reaction by provincial health authorities to the first warning of a new contagious disease was to detain and reprimand the messenger: Dr. Li Wenliang, the doomed hero of the COVID-19 tragedy. As late as December 31, the same authorities were proclaiming that “the disease is preventable and controllable,” and the World Health Organization’s (WHO) office in Beijing accepted the cheerful assessment without question. In mid-January, weeks after the initial outbreak, the city of Wuhan hosted a large-scale Lunar New Year dinner attended by 40,000 families. It is futile to speculate whether the pandemic might have been prevented if the people with power in China had acted responsibly on the information they possessed. In any event, by the time the human toll could no longer be concealed, the virus could no longer be contained.  As I write this, over 81,000 cases of COVID-19 infection have been reported by the Chinese authorities. Around 3,200 of the afflicted are said to have died. Since the regime is a circle of mutual deception, we can assume that the truth is even more appalling. For a ruling class whose legitimacy depends on the perception of ruthless competence, this is a dangerous moment. The usual displays of muscularity—such as building a massive hospital in ten days—have failed to mollify an outraged public. The political and economic consequences, even in the short term, very much bear watching.  Iran followed the same trajectory as China, for the same reasons. Information about the pandemic was treated like a political attack on the regime—something to be angrily refuted rather than swiftly acted upon. The government’s priority was to ensure a large turnout of voters in the February elections that could be promoted as an endorsement of the system. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, accused Iran’s enemies of exaggerating the danger of infection to keep voters away. The deputy health minister, Iraj Harirchi, was trotted out to downplay the dimensions of the pandemic, a day before he tested positive for the virus and was quarantined. The widely viewed video of a sickly Harirchi uttering his denials can stand as a parable for the end of dictatorial illusions about information control.  A Triumph of Noise Over Authority  If the public in authoritarian nations was the victim of a fatal silence on the virus, exactly the opposite has transpired in the democratic world. We are drowning in information. We are dazed by the noise.  Shortly before his death, Dr. Li Wenliang pleaded, “there should be more than one voice in a healthy society,” but the uproar of voices surrounding the pandemic has paralyzed many ordinary people trying to decide on the best course of action. On mass media and social media alike, accusations, criticisms, and invidious comparisons—between this country and that one, between present performance and the past—have chased one another at the speed of light. Political commentators have discoursed on the complexities of contagion. Health experts have raged at government decisions. Everyone has had an opinion, a recommendation, a plan, a cure—the Food and Drug Administration found it necessary to insist that drinking bleach would not protect against infection and might, in fact, kill the drinker.  Americans paid scant attention to the story until January 21, when the first case was reported in the United States. Since that wake-up call, the two overlapping viralities—the actual spread of COVID-19 and our ceaseless chatter about the disease—have competed for our attention. Increasingly, the latter has obscured the former. By early February, the WHO complained of a “massive infodemic” running parallel to the pandemic that “makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it.” The warning did little more than state the obvious about our post-truth information sphere.  Panic, posturing, conspiracy theories, and malicious lies have flooded the usual online pathways. China was said to have cooked up COVID-19 in a secret biological warfare laboratory—an accusation soon turned against the CIA. Even Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft, received an honorary mention as the cause of the disease—but then, so did the Rothschilds. On the one hand, matters were proclaimed to be far worse than the authorities dared to reveal. Exaggerating the death toll, particularly in China, became a competitive sport. On the other hand, cures were believed to be at hand, though held back for obscure reasons. A Facebook post maintained that a vaccine against the virus already existed. Needless to say, it went wildly viral.  For once, the large digital platforms behaved responsibly. Mark Zuckerberg offered the WHO free space on Facebook. Google and Microsoft gave away advanced streaming tools to connect those working from home. Amazon prioritized deliveries of food and medical supplies. Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter labored to “remove content with false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by global health organizations.” Searches for “coronavirus” were routed to reputable health organizations like the WHO or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and to mainstream news media reports.  Such well-intentioned efforts did nothing to abate the uproar. The tsunami of digital information was too vast and moved too fast for tactical interventions. As we should have learned from the “fake news” controversy of 2016, the line between fact, perspective, opinion, and manipulative falsehood is less clear than we might imagine—and there are no trusted gatekeepers to make the call. That is at the heart of our predicament.  When the COVID-19 story hit, the information sphere already suffered from a pre-existing condition: a hemorrhage in the legitimacy of the big institutions. In every field, the authorities lacked credibility. Facebook and Twitter could bend the knee before WHO or the CDC or the New York Times, but the public remained angry and mistrustful. The power to explain persuasively has fractured, and the account of the pandemic was always destined to be a ragged babble of voices.  Tweeting in the Time of Coronavirus  The public expected the institutions to fail, and in the present emergency many believe their worst expectations have been met. Scorn has been heaped on the WHO for its submissive posture with regard to China. The CDC became a target of outrage after an abject and prolonged failure to produce adequate supplies of the COVID-19 test kit. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has received its share of condemnation for appearing to be mesmerized by proceduralism and uninterested in delivering a cure.  Much of the criticism has been justified. In the rolling chaos of the crisis, global and national health institutions have not covered themselves with glory. The public might reasonably expect that something called “Centers for Disease Control” should actually control the spread of the disease. It did no such thing. Yet the CDC isn’t just a name; it’s a ponderous hierarchy of 15,000 people, hedged by strictures and regulations that made perfect sense under normal conditions. Like all bureaucracies, it lacked a panic button. Similarly, the WHO is a transnational organization that can exist only by kowtowing to powerful but propaganda-prone dictatorships.  This was nothing like the willful deception and moral vacuum of Wuhan, however. This was a structural inadequacy to process information at the relentless pace of the contagion—which is to say, of a highly mobile public. In China, COVID-19 might have been reduced to a minimum of lost lives. Once the virus leaped that initial barrier, an enormous number of variables were added to the equation. The health bureaucracies of the democratic world should have performed more competently, but the improvement, except for a few outliers, would have occurred on the random margins of the outbreak.  The country needed a voice for calm and responsibility in the storm. Instead, it got Donald Trump  Of our political institutions and leadership, the less said the better. The country needed a voice for calm and responsibility in the storm. Instead, it got Donald Trump. For three years, the president had cast an immense shadow over the information landscape. He has dealt with crises and controversies simply by absorbing them, making them all about his larger-than-life, love-me-or-loathe-me personality. This he could not do with COVID-19. In the existential moment of a worldwide pandemic, disputes about Trump’s performance have occupied a limited space in the public’s attention. The story this time was never going to be about him, and the president seemed baffled regarding the part he was expected to play.  His tweets followed an arc from truculence to eventual comprehension. Deep into February and early March, Trump downplayed the danger from the virus, comparing it favorably with the death toll from flu season, when “Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on.” “Market starting to look very good to me!” he tweeted, even as the Dow Jones suffered near-record losses. Inevitably, the enemies to be blamed for sowing panic were the “fake news” media and his Democratic Party opponents. And on the subject of COVID-19, the connection between presidential tweets and medical reality has been, on occasion, tenuous.  But Trump is nothing if not attuned to his audience, and around mid-March, the script on social media flipped. While he could not resist an occasional boast or a gratuitous troll, the Twitter stream of this most personalistic of politicians turned largely institutional in content. The president began to call for national unity and to praise various groups in civil society and government for their efforts during the outbreak. His retweets drew attention to the details of virus-related legislation. He began to retweet the words of others—senators, health authorities, even journalists—more than he tweeted his own.  Like a significant slice of the world’s population, President Trump has adapted his behavior to extraordinary circumstances. Populist disruption has given way to establishment theater: a daily televised press conference on the outbreak has become the preferred mode of presidential communication. Ratings have been astoundingly high. At the moment, Trump ranks with those leaders—Emmanuel Macron of France, for one—who have received a measure of public approval for their handling of the crisis.  That does nothing to alter the reality of the situation. With very few exceptions, governments have been helpless to prevent the spread of the infection and slow to respond to its effects. The hemorrhage of authority has advanced in tandem with the pandemic. Donald Trump, a creature of the sickness of the institutions, was not built for reassurance: in his new conventional posture, he sometimes has resembled an arsonist condemned by a strange fate to impersonate a firefighter.  An Extinction Event of the Institutions  The enormity of the COVID-19 story in the eyes of the public has cast every other aspect of human life into the dark. On March 12, the U.S. military launched an air strike against pro-Iranian militias in Iraq—part of a policy of violent retaliation that, not long ago, had generated much controversy. The attack went mostly unnoticed. On March 16, Russia’s highest court opened the way for Vladimir Putin to remain president until 2036. Outside the battered Russian opposition, few paid attention to this remarkable power grab. Events in the world have not been frozen in place by the pandemic. Yet the information sphere has left no space for anything else.  Agenda-setting theory holds that an event will appear significant to the degree that it dominates public discussion. The unprecedented informational disproportion between COVID-19 and all else has made the disease feel like an equally unprecedented catastrophe. Digital and media noise, as much as any scientific projections, helped stampede the markets and drove elected officials to measures that really were without precedent. Liberal democratic governors, who only a few months before had criticized President Trump’s tough stance on immigration, have now closed the borders of their states and locked down citizens in their homes. Whether this was prudent anticipation that would result in saved lives or a panicked response to the uproar may not be known until the tempest is over—and possibly not even then.  Despite the astronomical levels of information, very little is known with certainty.  The same holds true for the entire episode. Despite the astronomical levels of information, very little is known with certainty. Trillions of dollars evaporated from the financial markets while much of the global economy stood immobilized. Does the potential toll from the virus justify the cost to impoverished households? Only an inaudible minority appeared interested in reckoning such trade-offs.  Meanwhile, the great health organizations have been improvising every step of the way. Before condemning the “infodemic,” the WHO contributed to it by tweeting that “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission” of the virus had been found “by the Chinese authorities.” The properties of potential antiviral drugs like chloroquine have become a topic of constant wrangling among global experts. A survey of infectious disease researchers has delivered vastly disparate estimates of mortality in the United States: anywhere between 4,000 and 1 million.  Governments at every level have also stumbled forward one decision at a time. The surest sign of uncertainty has been the lack of a framework back to normalcy. Presidents, ministers, bureaucrats—none can see past the noise.  Information is the thin patchwork of what we know, or think we know, spread over the infinite complexity of the world. Often, it’s not enough. Under conditions of insufficient knowledge, central planning becomes less useful than local adaptation. Trial and error conducted from the bottom up should inform decisions made at the top. From the onset of the crisis, pockets of civil society have led the way to an appropriate response.  With the CDC and FDA tied up in bureaucratic knots, doctors at the University of Washington developed their own COVID-19 test kits, and the Gates Foundation offered home test kits to the public. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, donated 1,000 ventilators needed by California hospitals. Preprint servers for scientific studies began to release “a torrent of data” on the pandemic, forcing the institutional peer-reviewed journals to improve on their speed of publication. The national governments most successful in managing the outbreak, like that of Taiwan, have worked in fruitful partnership with the private sector.  Amid the lockdowns and other desperate measures, it is possible to discern the venerable structures that govern our world tearing apart at the seams—and something strange and new moving into their place. The crisis of authority has been thrown into fast forward: the new coronavirus, like the meteor that killed off the dinosaurs, appears to have smashed open a space for faster, nimbler institutional forms, better adapted to the movement of information in the digital age.  But that is still guesswork. To learn what will emerge on the far side of the crisis, we will have to wait however long it takes before the noise subsides.

Japan reported its first death, a woman in her 80s who had been hospitalized since early February. She is the third confirmed fatality outside of mainland China, after deaths in the Philippines and Hong Kong.  The new diagnostic approach came on the same day that Hubei and its stricken capital, Wuhan, replaced their top officials in an apparent response to public criticism of how authorities have handled the epidemic.  The death toll in China reached 1,367, up 254 from the previous day. The number of confirmed cases jumped 15,152 to 59,804. The unusually large increases were due to the change in Hubei’s approach.  The total now includes more than 13,000 cases of “clinical diagnosis” in Hubei, which appears to include those based on a doctors’ analysis combined with lung imaging, as opposed to waiting for laboratory test results.  In breaking down the large number of new cases in China, National Health Commission spokesman Mi Feng said Hubei had adopted a revised diagnosis and treatment plan aimed at accelerating the identification and treatment of patients.  That adds a “clinical diagnosis case” classification to identify suspected cases who appear to have pneumonia so that patients can be accepted as soon as possible and treated as confirmed cases, Mi said, adding that should “reduce severe illness and mortality.”  One expert said the changed case definition in Hubei likely speaks to the crush of patients the health system is experiencing and the backlog of untested samples.  “Clearly in Wuhan, the health system is under extreme pressure and so the first priority has to be the patient,” said Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh.  He said it wasn’t unprecedented for case definitions to rely on doctors’ diagnoses rather than wait for laboratory confirmation, and that these kinds of changes usually happen when there are simply too many patients to process in a fast-moving outbreak.  “I’m not surprised that this has happened given the way the outbreak has been going in China,” Woolhouse said. “You have to be pragmatic and take the concerns of the patient first and treat them as if they already have the disease, even in the absence of lab confirmation.”  China also appointed new high-level officials in Hubei and Wuhan.  Former Shanghai Mayor Ying Yong succeeded Jiang Chaoliang as the ruling Communist Party chief in the beleaguered province, the Xinhua state news agency reported, while Wang Zhonglin took over from Ma Guoqiang as the party secretary in Wuhan.  The appointments follow the sacking earlier this week of two leaders of the provincial health commission. State media also reported that a slew of others were expelled from the party for transgressions related to the epidemic.  The public has widely criticized local officials for failing to respond quickly and decisively to the new virus. Authorities initially assured people that there was little to no risk of human-to-human transmission, a statement that was later retracted. Wuhan residents said hospitals were overcrowded and lacked sufficient medical supplies. Doctors who tried to share information early on were reprimanded by police for “spreading rumors.”  Many countries have implemented travel restrictions on recent visitors to China, which has more than 99% of the world’s reported infections.  In an unprecedented measure to contain the disease, recently named COVID-19, the Chinese government has placed the hardest-hit cities — home to more than 60 million — under lockdown. One district in Shiyan, a city in Hubei, has implemented “wartime measures,” barring residents from leaving even their apartment compounds for two weeks.  According to a local government notice, neighborhood committees will distribute basic necessities at a fixed time and at fixed prices, as well as help residents purchase any medicine they might urgently need.  Xu Min, a resident of Shiyan’s Zhangwan district, said her neighborhood entrance was being guarded by community workers and security staff.  “It doesn’t have too much of an impact on our life, except that we’re not allowed to go out,” Xu said.  World Health Organization spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said the agency is seeking more clarity from China on the updates to its case definition and reporting protocol.  “It is our current understanding that the new case definition widens the net, and includes not only lab-confirmed cases but also clinically diagnosed cases based on symptoms and exposure,” Jasarevic said in an email to The Associated Press.  “The jump in cases today reflects the broader definition,” he said.  An advance team of WHO experts has been in China since Monday. The team is here to “discuss specific arrangements for the China-WHO joint mission with the Chinese side,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a daily online briefing.  “The purpose of the joint mission is that experts of both sides can have in-depth communication on the situation and efforts of prevention and control, and come up with advice for China and other affected countries,” Geng said.  In Vietnam, official media reported that a village of 10,000 northwest of the capital, Hanoi, was put in lockdown due to a cluster of cases there.  The online newspaper VN Express cited a senior official of Vinh Phuc province as reporting an increase in cases in Son Loi. Vietnam has confirmed 16 cases, most of them in the province.  Japan’s Health Ministry announced Thursday that 44 more people on a cruise ship quarantined in the port of Yokohama, near Tokyo, have tested positive for COVID-19. The ship has 218 infections among its 3,700 passengers and crew.  Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters five of the patients who were already sent to hospitals for isolation and treatment have severe symptoms and are on artificial respirators or under intensive care.  Another cruise ship, the Westerdam, finally docked Thursday in Cambodia after being turned away by several Asian and Pacific governments. No cases of the viral illness have been confirmed among its 1,455 passengers and 802 crew members, according to operator Holland America Line.  Thailand refused to allow the Westerdam to dock this week after it had already been turned away by the Philippines, Taiwan, Japan and Guam over virus concerns.  The Westerdam began its cruise in Singapore last month and its last stop before it was refused further landings was in Hong Kong, where 51 cases of the viral disease have been confirmed.

Miami-Dade county is up to 287 deaths in total today, giving a crude Infection Fatality Rate of 0.17% so far, much lower than the 0.9% seen in New York City in yesterday’s new serological results, but more in line with California results.  One way to explain the bafflingly heterogeneous results we are constantly being confronted with is to posit Viral BioDiversity: there could be different strains in different places. For example, VBD could potentially account for why there are so many more deaths per person with antibodies in New York City than in Miami: it could be that there’s a New York City variant that is more lethal than the variant prevalent in Miami.  One problem with this explanation is that it’s unfalsifiable. You can use it to explain away any anomaly, which might lead you to overlook something that you could do something about. For example, maybe New York City is doing something wrong that Miami is doing right, which would be useful to figure out.  The study, spurred by Miami-Dade County officials, will be an ongoing weekly survey based on antibody testing — randomly selecting county residents to volunteer pinpricks of their blood to be screened for signs of a past COVID-19 infection, whether they had tested positive for the virus in the past or not. … Friday’s results, based on two weeks of countywide antibody testing and about 1,400 participants, found that about half of the people who tested positive for antibodies reported no symptoms in the 14-17 days before being tested. … Gimenez said the UM survey of Miami-Dade reflects a national trend showing African Americans are disproportionately impacted by the novel coronavirus. “African Americans are more than twice as likely to be infected with COVID-19 than other racial groups,” he said. The survey findings also indicate that Miami-Dade is far from the 60% or higher infection rate needed to reach herd immunity, when enough people are infected to stop the spread of the virus by slowing transmission. … UM researchers used statistical methods to account for the limitations of the antibody test, which is known to generate some false positive results. The researchers say they are 95% certain that the true amount of infection lies between 4.4% and 7.9% of the population, with 6% representing the best estimate. The results are similar but not identical to other serological surveys in California, but indicate far less infections than a recent survey in New York, which found a nearly 14% infection rate statewide and upwards of 20% in New York City. … UM researchers say their findings are more robust than most because they used Florida Power & Light to generate phone numbers in targeted demographic areas, leading to a more randomized selection of participants.  On the other hand, scientists are only now starting to get a good handle on how many false positives and false negatives are generated by antibody tests. From the NYT today:  Coronavirus Antibody Tests: Can You Trust the Results? A team of scientists worked around the clock to evaluate 14 antibody tests. A few worked as advertised. Most did not. By Apoorva Mandavilli  April 24, 2020 … For the past few weeks, more than 50 scientists have been working diligently to do something that the Food and Drug Administration mostly has not: Verifying that 14 coronavirus antibody tests now on the market actually deliver accurate results.  Here’s the organization’s website and draft preprint.  These tests are crucial to reopening the economy, but public health experts have raised urgent concerns about their quality. The new research, completed just days ago and posted online Friday, confirmed some of those fears: Of the 14 tests, only three delivered consistently reliable results. Even the best had some flaws. … In the new research, researchers found that only one of the tests never delivered a so-called false positive — that is, it never mistakenly signaled antibodies in people who did not have them. Two other tests did not deliver false-positive results 99 percent of the time. But the converse was not true. Even these three tests detected antibodies in infected people only 90 percent of the time, at best. The false-positive metric is particularly important. The result may lead people to believe themselves immune to the virus when they are not, and to put themselves in danger by abandoning social distancing and other protective measures.  False positives are important when infection rates are in the single digits. Last week’s Stanford test found about 50 positives among 3300 tested individuals, or a raw percentage of 1.5%. On the other hand, the New York City 21% finding is less likely to be highly inflated by false positives.  … Other scientists were less sanguine than Dr. Marson. Four of the tests produced false-positive rates ranging from 11 percent to 16 percent; many of the rest hovered around 5 percent. “Those numbers are just unacceptable,” said Scott Hensley, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania. “The tone of the paper is, ‘Look how good the tests are.’ But I look at these data, and I don’t really see that.” The proportion of people in the United States who have been exposed to the coronavirus is likely to be 5 percent or less, Dr. Hensley said. “If your kit has a 3 percent false-positive, how do you interpret that? It’s basically impossible,” he said. “If your kit has 14 percent false positive, it’s useless.” … New tests also usually compete with an established gold standard. Lacking such a standard, the team instead compared all the tests in a “head-to-head bake-off to see who’s the winner,” Dr. Hsu said. Each test was evaluated with the same set of blood samples: from 80 people known to be infected with the coronavirus, at different points after infection; 108 samples donated before the pandemic; and 52 samples from people who were positive for other viral infections but had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Tests made by Sure Biotech and Wondfo Biotech, along with an in-house Elisa test, produced the fewest false positives. A test made by Bioperfectus detected antibodies in 100 percent of the infected samples, but only after three weeks of infection. None of the tests did better than 80 percent until that time period, which was longer than expected, Dr. Hsu said. The lesson is that the tests are less likely to produce false negatives the longer ago the initial infection occurred, he said. The tests were particularly variable when looking for a transient antibody that comes up soon after infection, called IgM, and more consistent in identifying a subsequent antibody, called IgG, that may signal longer-term immunity. “You can see that antibody levels rise at different points for every patient,” Dr. Hsu said. The tests performed best when the researchers assessed both types of antibodies together. None of the tests could say whether the presence of these antibodies means a person is protected from reinfection, however. The results overall are promising, Dr. Marson added. “There are multiple tests that have specificities greater than 95 percent.” … Dr. Krammer said false positives are less of an issue for assessing how widely the virus has spread in the population. If a test has a known false-positive rate, scientists can factor that into their calculations, he said.  Assuming you know the false positive and false negative rates.  But false positives become dangerous when making policy and personal decisions about who can go back to work. “You don’t want anybody back to work who has a false positive — that’s the last thing you want to do,” Dr. Krammer said.  Unfortunately, this article doesn’t mention which tests were used in the various results we are now getting in from around the world.

On “Fox & Friends” Friday morning, Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr. said people are “overreacting” to COVID-19 — which has sickened more than 137,000 and killed more than 5,000 people worldwide — and he also said the pandemic was conspired by North Korea and China.  After the hosts asked him about the mass cancellations of schools and sporting events, he said, “You know, it’s just strange to me how so many are overreacting. The H1N1 virus, in 2009, killed 17,000 people. It was the flu, also, I think. And there was not the same hype. It was — you just didn’t see it on the news 24/7. And it makes you wonder if there’s a political reason for that.”  He continued by saying, “Impeachment didn’t work, and the Mueller report didn’t work, and Article 25 didn’t work, and so maybe now this is their next attempt to get Trump.”   And then he said:  “ “The owner of a restaurant asked me last night, he said, ‘Do you remember the North Korean leader promised a Christmas present for America, back in December?’ Could it be they got together with China, and this is that present?’” ”  “I don’t know. But it really is something strange going on,” he said with a chuckle.  This spurred backlash from many on Twitter TWTR, +2.43% , who criticized the “Fox & Friends” hosts for not pushing back or disputing these statements at all.  Fox News, which shares common ownership with MarketWatch, has taken some heat for its coronavirus coverage this week. Host Trish Regan sparked similar Twitter outrage on Monday night when she also said that coronavirus coverage has been “another attempt to impeach the president.”  “We’ve reached a tipping point,” she said, as a graphic reading “Coronavirus Impeachment Scam” was put on the screen beside her. “The chorus of hate being leveled at the president is nearing a crescendo as Democrats blame him and only him for a virus that originated halfway around the world.”  Related:Influenza kills more people than coronavirus so everyone is overreacting, right?

Maybe they’re just not paying attention or maybe they believe they’re serving some higher cause by shading reality.”  In a Fox News memo obtained by the Los Angeles Times, the Daily Beast and other news outlets on Thursday, company executives called on the news channel’s staffers to “keep in mind that viewers rely on us to stay informed during a crisis of this magnitude and we are providing an important public service to our audience by functioning as a resource for all Americans.”  Related:Is coronavirus airborne?

The official who disclosed plans for the first participant spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the move has not been publicly announced.  Public health officials say it will take a year to 18 months to fully validate any potential vaccine. Testing will begin with 45 young, healthy volunteers with different doses of shots co-developed by NIH and Moderna Inc.

Asked if he would prefer something like a 14-day national shutdown, Fauci told NBC: “You know, I would prefer as much as we possibly could. I think we should really be overly aggressive and get criticized for overreacting.\"  Fauci, making the Sunday talk show rounds, told ABC's \"This Week\" that domestic travel restrictions have not been seriously considered by the federal task force – yet.  \"I do not see that right now in the immediate future,\" Fauci said. \"But, remember, we are very open minded about whatever it takes to preserve the health of the American public.\"   – David Jackson  States start shuttering bars and restaurants, encourage takeout  The governors in several states — California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio, New York and Washington among them — mandated the closings of bars, restaurants and wineries on Sunday in an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus.

Charlie Baker told reporters, \"If we take decisive steps now and everyone plays their part by following the best medical guidance, we can slow down the spread.\"  Also Sunday, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf ordered all restaurants and bars across five counties (Allegheny, Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery) to close dine-in facilities to help control the spread of the virus, beginning Monday.   – Lindsay Schnell  Hotels on Las Vegas Strip start to close  Wynn Resorts will close its two luxury hotel-casinos on the Las Vegas Strip for two weeks starting Tuesday. MGM will cease casino operations on Monday and will completely close its properties on Tuesday.  \"It is now apparent that this is a public health crisis that requires major collective action if we are to slow its progression,\" Jim Murren, Chairman and CEO of MGM Resorts, said in a statement.  The companies announced the closures after Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak ordered that all K-12 public schools in the Clark County School District close.  After two weeks, the Wynn resorts will evaluate the situation, according to a release sent to investors. MGM will not take reservations for new arrivals prior to May 1.  – Ed Komenda, Reno Gazette Journal  Fed cuts rate to zero, launches more bond purchases in historic moves  The Federal Reserve unleashed much of its arsenal Sunday to combat the economic damage caused by the coronavirus, cutting short-term interest rates to zero, renewing its crisis-era bond purchases to lower long-term rates and encouraging more bank loans to households and businesses.  Central bank policymakers agreed to lower the Fed’s benchmark federal funds rate by a full percentage point to a range of zero to 0.25% — where it hovered for years during and after the 2008 financial crisis.  “The coronavirus outbreak has harmed communities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States,” the Fed said in a statement. “The effects of the coronavirus will weigh on economic activity in the near-term and pose risks to the economic outlook.\"  The Fed already had cut its key rate by half percentage point earlier this month. Many economists expected the central bank to agree to a percentage point cut at a two-day meeting that ends Wednesday, but the Fed decided to move early in a historic show of force.   – Paul Davidson  Health care officials say tests will ramp up nationwide this week  Vice President Mike Pence and other health officials said two factors will allow them to increase testing capacity dramatically in coming days: Some 2,000 labs coming online across the nation to process tests and high throughput tests that can be used for drive-through or walk-up test centers.  Admiral Brett P. Giroir, assistant secretary of health at the Department of Health and Human Services, said gear and federal health care workers would being shipping out Monday.  Health officials said they were focusing those tests on two groups: Healthcare workers and first responders as well as those who are 65 and older with a respiratory symptom and a fever of at least 99.6 degrees. The officials implored Americans to help prioritize those two groups.  – John Fritze and David Jackson  Parents brace for kids at home; thousands of schools close  Minnesota and South Carolina shut public schools effective Monday as the wave of widespread closings in the U.S. continued to grow. More than 20 states and a number of large urban school districts — including Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest — are shutting down all K-12 schools as part of a sweeping attempt to contain the spread of the coronavirus.  Florida, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington are among states shutting down schools.

The university hosted the event in response to what UW-Madison police called an increase in \"bias incidents\" both on campus and online against members of the community perceived to be from China, according to a statement. A post on the university's Asian American studies Facebook page showed racist messages written in chalk on campus.  Administrators assured the hundreds of meeting participants that the messages have been removed, and the university is working with police to find video footage of the incident.  Christina Olstad, the university's dean of students, expressed disgust for the chalk messages and other hateful acts.  \"There have been individuals coughing in students’ faces. They have been engaging in behavior that is — it’s disgusting, it’s unacceptable, it’s racist, and I wanna call it what it is and I want us to do something about it,\" Olstad said.  University of Wisconsin-Madison Dean of Students Christina Olstad addresses a March 26, 2020 virtual town hall meeting about racist chalk messages written on campus. The university has reported an increase in the number of bias reports involving incidents against Asian and international individuals as the COVID-19 pandemic rages. Miranda Suarez/WPR  Jenna Friedman, assistant director of bias response, said the university has received 81 total bias incident reports this semester. Out of that total, 47 involve Asian or international individuals. The chalking incident alone garnered 25 complaints.  In central Wisconsin, a series of incidents in the Wausau area led law enforcement leaders to issue statements denouncing xenophobic attacks.  In a statement posted online on Wednesday evening, Marathon County Sheriff Scott Parks wrote that his department and other local police agencies are investigating verbal and physical attacks and instances of vandalism believed to be motivated by fear amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Marathon County has about 8,000 Asian residents, most of whom are Hmong.  The COVID-19 virus originated in China, a fact emphasized by some political leaders, including President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly referred to the pandemic disease as \"the Chinese virus.\"  In an interview on Thursday, Parks said in central Wisconsin there have been \"intimidation confrontations, where individuals have made derogatory remarks, have stopped movement by blocking, or have gone so far as to even spit or cough on persons with the idea that the virus is being returned.\" Parks said there have also been reports of vandalism.  Some of these incidents have been formally reported to police and some haven't, Parks said. He declined to discuss any specific incident due to ongoing investigations. No one has been arrested in these incidents.  Parks said he intended his statement as a way of assuring the community that his department and others take the crimes seriously, as well as to encourage victims to come forward and let offenders know they will face consequences.  \"We are aware that this is taking place,\" Parks said. \"We are conducting follow-up. And if you are identified as being involved in this, our intention is to forward you for prosecution.\"  Mary Thao, a Wausau City Council member, declined to speak about the details of incidents in the community. She said she's grateful for the support of the Hmong and southeast Asian community from the sheriff and the Wausau Police Department, which also issued a statement denouncing racial attacks and pledging to investigate incidents.  \"This is a crisis for everyone,\" Thao said. \"This virus doesn't discriminate. It goes beyond all borders, all people, all color. And this is a time for us to really band together, so we can all get through this together.\"  UW-Madison's virtual town hall was interrupted twice: once when a meeting participant exposed his rear end to the camera, and again when another person interrupted a speaker to hurl racial slurs at her.

The university is holding a virtual forum for Asian and Asian American faculty and staff on Friday, and shared UW-Madison's bias incident log, where the public can review incident reports and any action the university has taken on them. An international student advisory board has its first meeting scheduled for next week and plans to discuss the issue.  Reports of harassment and attacks on Asian Americans has been a national trend, including violent assaults reported in New York, Los Angeles and Midland, Texas.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has appointed Vice President Mike Pence to lead the U.S. response to the global coronavirus outbreak. Trump made the announcement while discussing the coronavirus threat at a White House news conference on Wednesday.  The session comes a day after he sought to minimize fears of the virus, called COVID-19, spreading widely across the U.S.  The president started his address around 6:30 p.m. Eastern time. He was joined by officials including representatives from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Trump says the U.S. is “very, very ready” for whatever the new coronavirus threat brings. He said, Pence in charge of overseeing the nation's response, is working with the government's top health authorities.  The president has been pushing back against criticism that his administration isn't doing enough to meet the coronavirus threat. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers are calling for much more money than the $2.5 billion the White House has requested, and Trump indicated at the news conference that he'd be open to more spending.  Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has asked for $8.5 billion.  Trump and members of his administration have been sending mixed signals about the virus. While the CDC has warned the public to prepare for a coronavirus outbreak, Trump said Tuesday that the situation is “very well under control in our country.”  Trump has asked for $2.5 billion to combat the virus, but many in Congress say that's not enough.  Schumer has unveiled an $8.5 billion request to respond to the virus outbreak in the U.S., more than triple Trump's request. The money would go toward efforts to contain the outbreak in the U.S., vaccine development and manufacture, and reimbursement to states for their costs in tackling the outbreak. The money would be an emergency spending request, Schumer said Wednesday.  On Wednesday morning, Trump attacked MSNBC and CNN on Twitter for making the coronavirus \"look as bad as possible\" and \"panicking markets.\" He added that the U.S. is in \"great shape.\"  Currently, the White House is considering whether to appoint a coronavirus czar to coordinate the response to the epidemic, according to Politico. Currently, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar is leading the administration's coronavirus coordinating efforts.  Politico says former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is among several individuals being considered for the new role.  During the 2014 Ebola outbreak, the Obama administration named Ron Klain, former chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden, to coordinate Ebola-fighting efforts for a four-month period.  In a Tuesday news conference, officials at the CDC said that spread of the virus in the U.S. was not a question of \"if\" but \"when.\"  Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the CDC's director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said the virus was \"rapidly evolving and spreading\" and that as more countries experience the spread of the coronavirus, Americans may have to prepare for the possibility of a U.S. outbreak.  Houston Health Authority Dr. David Persse said that concern comes from the likely chance that someone infected with coronavirus will come to the U.S. and start spreading the virus before they can be identified and isolated.  He stressed that there is no need for people in the U.S. to panic.  “We are anticipating that that it is likely to occur at some point, hopefully it won’t, but we need to anticipate and behave as if it will at some point so we can take advantage of the time we have now and change our behaviors and protect ourselves should it occur that it spreads in the United States,” Persse said.  More than 80,000 people have been infected globally in the COVID-19 outbreak. More than 77,000 infections and more than 2,600 deaths have been reported in China.

Government officials and health services across the globe are urging people to only leave the house when absolutely necessary, but for many home is not a safe place.   Advert 10  The number of domestic abuse victims and the number of assaults appear to have been on the rise in the UK since isolation measures began, with domestic abuse charity Refuge revealing a 25% increase in calls to their helpline and a 150% increase in website visits.  Similarly, in the US, law enforcement officials told ABC News they fear a rise in domestic violence incidents.  Together, Rihanna’s Clara Lionel Foundation and Dorsey are looking to aid victims and have committed to donating $2.1 million each to the Mayor’s Fund for Los Angeles in order to help manage the domestic violence crisis.   Advert 10  The Clara Lionel Foundation, founded by Rihanna in 2012 in honour of her grandparents, Clara and Lionel, states that an estimated 10 million people experience domestic violence in the US each year.  The LA Housing Authority estimates approximately 90 individuals and their children are being turned away from domestic violence shelters every week due to them being at capacity, with incidents on the rise since stay at home orders were issued in March.  Rihanna and Dorsey’s donation will go towards providing 10 weeks’ worth of support for victims of domestic abuse, including shelter, meals and counselling for individuals and their children.   Advert 10  Though the initiative is currently focusing on victims in LA, the announcement acknowledged ‘victims of domestic violence exist all across the world, so this is just the beginning’, Variety reports.  This isn’t the first donation the Clara Lionel Foundation has made in the wake of the outbreak, as Rihanna and Dorsey’s grant follows two previous emergency response grants, bringing the foundation’s total to over $8 million in support.   Rihanna PA Images  On March 31, the foundation announced a collaboration with Jay-Z’s Shawn Carter Foundation to donate $2 million in grants in support of undocumented workers, the children of front line health care workers and first responders, as well as incarcerated, elderly and homeless populations in New York City and LA.   Advert 10  The foundation previously announced $5 million in grants to protect vulnerable communities in the United States, the Caribbean and in Africa.  Earlier this week, Dorsey announced he is giving $1 billion from his equity in his mobile-payment platform, Square, to help ‘fund global… relief.’  Support for domestic abuse victims is paramount at this time, when the opportunity to escape the house is more fleeting than ever. Earlier this week, BBC News presenter Victoria Derbyshire was praised for reading the news with a domestic abuse helpline number written on the back of her hand in an effort to encourage any victims to reach out.   Advert 10  Though staying at home is necessary to help save lives, it is contradictory if home is the place where people are in harm’s way. Hopefully Rihanna and Dorsey’s grant will go a long way to providing support to those who need it most.

The University of South Carolina is extending its spring break by a week due to the coronavirus. The extended spring break would end on March 20 instead of March 13.  All campus events next week will be canceled.  USC will then move to virtual classes from March 23 until March 30. The university will remain open, including residence halls, food services and limited transit.  Students received a message on Tuesday that encouraged them to take all textbooks and laptops with them when leaving for spring break.  As of Wednesday morning, no changes have been made to campus operations. Clemson says one individual who was being monitored for COVID-19 is negative.  At the College of Charleston, officials say all in-person classes will be held online Thursday so the school can test the option for online classes.  College of Charleston President Andrew Hsu hopes the switch to online classes is not necessary and says the response to the plan has been positive.  “Students are happy that we are taking this precaution and getting ready in case we have to put every course online,” he told News 2 on Tuesday. “Try to be ready, but I’m not sure if anyone in the U.S. is really ready, so we will do the best we can.”  President Hsu says as far as the e-learning classes, it is up to professors to decide a format that works best for them and their students.  Students are encouraged to take any items they may need to continue classes online, like textbooks, materials, laptops, as they leave for spring break in case the college decides to move to a virtual setting.  Meanwhile, Coastal Carolina University will also extend spring break over coronavirus concerns.  Students will return to class on March 23rd.  Furman University is canceling classes until further notice as part of their coronavirus response plan. The school is extending spring break for students by one week through March 22.  Remote instruction will begin March 23 through at least March 27. Starting March 16, all non-athletics events are canceled or being postponed through at least March 30.  All on-campus class meetings have been suspended, and they say students should stay home and not return to campus until further notice.  S.C.

In a release, the university emphasized this is not an extension of spring break. Students who can stay home are encouraged to do so.  Starting Monday, March 16, all faculty will use Blackboard to conduct classes.  Charleston Southern hopes one week is enough for the COVID-19 incubation period for any students who may have been exposed.

The total number of cases in the district was 100 till Monday night. Officials said that patients include a 33-year-old woman from the Tech Zone 4 area of Greater Noida, who gave birth to a boy around 1pm on Monday at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Greater Noida.  The woman’s husband is a doctor with Jaypee Hospital whose sample reports are awaited. Officials think that he possibly acted as a carrier. He has now been quarantined, they added. Recently, a 62-year-old Muzaffarnagar woman who had come for an operation to Jaypee Hospital, was found positive for Covid-19. The woman had undergone surgery for pancreatic tumour at the hospital on March 7.  The doctor’s wife was shifted from Jaypee Hospital in Sector 128 to GIMS on Sunday night.  GIMS director Dr Rakesh Gupta said that both mother and child are doing fine and are under observation.  The baby has been kept under observation away from the mother to ensure that the infection is not transmitted to him. A team of doctors and the medical staff lead by the chief medical superintendent and head of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Professor Shikha Seth conducted the woman’s caesarean surgery.  Officials had made special arrangements in the operation theatre as this was the first case where a Covid-19 patient needed an OT.  “Both mother and child are doing well. We will conduct a Covid-19 test for the baby on Tuesday as it can be performed only after 24 hours of birth. He is currently under observation. The chances of him getting the infection are almost zero as it can happen only after the child consumes the mother’s milk which won’t happen in this case. We are happy that our team successfully conducted the surgery after taking all required precautions,” Dr Rakesh Gupta, director, GIMS, said.  The second identified Covid-19 patient is a 52-year-old woman from Sector 34, Noida, who works with a private hospital in Patparganj, Delhi. Officials said that she was exposed in the operation theatre of the hospital. The woman is being treated at the same hospital’s branch in Delhi’s Saket area, where there are isolation wards for Covid-19 patients.  The third patient is a 61-year-old woman from Block B, Sector 55, Noida. The woman is a cancer patient and her condition was stable at the time of admission at the Sharda Hospital, officials said.

The 12-page complaint, filed in Manhattan Supreme Court on Monday on behalf of the property management company J & P Reality, alleges that 74-year-old Deborah Schevill's smoking habit has long been a cause of complaints from her upstairs neighbor Marianne Spinelli.  And it says the problem has intensified since the outbreak of COVID-19, which has forced many residents 'to be home twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.'  Schevill and Spinelli both have lived in the building in the 400 block of East 83rd Street for more than 30 years, with the former occupying unit 4D and the latter 5C.  Scroll down to read lawsuit  A Manhattan property management company is suing Deborah Schevill, 74, a tenant at this five-story building on East 83rd Street, accusing her of chain-smoking inside her unit and causing harm to her upstairs neighbor, Marianne Spinelli  The lawsuit obtained by DailyMail,com says that the five-story apartment building in March adopted a no-smoking policy, barring tenants from indulging their nicotine habit anywhere on the property.  But according to the complaint, Schevill has continued puffing away on both tobacco and marijuana cigarettes inside her unit, claiming that she has an 'unfettered right' to do so.  As a result, the hallways and common areas inside the building have become permeated with the noxious smell of smoke.  The smoke is said to be so concentrated in her upstairs neighbor's unit it is 'constituting a physical assault, burning her lungs an sinuses and causing a loss of sleep.'  The lawsuit alleges that Spinelli, 66, who is said to be allergic to smoke, has been suffering from burning in her sinuses, eyes and lungs.  The 'heavy smoke' rising from Schevill's apartment allegedly has made Spinelli 'violently ill' with migraine headaches and forced her to sleep in a mask and scarf on her face.  The lawsuit also names Spinelli as a defendant alongside Schevill, claiming that the woman has been refusing to let anyone from the management company into her apartment to assess the situation and make repairs by sealing any openings.  According to the court filing, the 74-year-old Schevill has admitted to chain-smoking inside her apartment and has refused to take any steps to stop the spread of second-hand smoke to others in the building.  But in an interview with the New York Daily News, the woman claimed to have quit the habit 'some time ago.' She also blamed her upstairs neighbor's respiratory problems on mold, 'hallucinations,' or other smokers purportedly living in the building.  In March, the building adopted a strict no-smoking policy, barring tenants from smoking anywhere on the property, but Schevill allegedly has continued puffing away  'Schevill is aware of Spinelli’s complaints and allegations, but refuses to cease smoking within her apartment or to take steps to mitigate the spread of secondhand smoke emanating from her apartment,' states the lawsuit. 'Schevill insists that she is not in the wrong.'  The management company's complaint argues that Schivelli's smoking is 'objectionable in it [sic] of itself, and even mote so during the Coronavirus Pandemic,' when residents are confined to their apartments.  J & P Reality is seeking $10,000 in legal fees from Schevill and a promise that she will stop smoking inside the building.

LEXINGTON, S.C. — No one stands in line to embrace the widow and share memories of her husband of 50 years. No rows of family and friends file toward the flag-draped coffin to pay their last respects. No symphony of sniffles is heard across the room as the minister gives a final prayer.  Instead, a handful of people are scattered across one chapel row as if they're strangers, not blood. White roses are pinned to empty chairs, representing those who couldn’t be there. An iPad on a tripod livestreams the service for people stuck at home across state lines.  “This is going to be a different experience for all of us,” the minister tells the half-dozen people gathered at a South Carolina funeral home to celebrate the life of J. Robert Coleman, an Army veteran, husband to Gloria, father to three sons and grandfather to three children. \"But one thing that will be common is that as we conduct this service today, we’re going to open with a prayer.”  Unspoken was the reason this funeral, and untold others across the world, is different: The coronavirus outbreak, stay-at-home orders and the rules of social distancing are dramatically altering the way families and communities mourn the passing of loved ones.  “It’s hard enough to lose a loved one, but then to have the traditions that usually bring comfort at a time like this seemingly not available just kind of compounds the grief that families feel,” said Justin Baxley, of Woodridge Memorial Park & Funeral Home.  Like most funeral homes, Woodridge is limiting the number of people allowed for services. Many families find it hard to choose which loved ones will be invited to the in-person gathering and which will be relegated to watch via livestream, if at all.  But Coleman's family said in their case, travel restrictions due to the virus and the nature of their small, close-knit family made following the fewer-than-10-people mandate simple. John Coleman said those who mattered most to his dad were there - his wife, Gloria, and his sons. The only one missing was his beloved dog, Bandit.  “That’s the most important,\" Coleman said. \"We weren’t brought up to care if we were around a big group.”  Robert Coleman died suddenly last week. One of his sons found him at home in Columbia. The family said he went peacefully, possibly of a heart attack, but because the 69-year-old had complained of chest pain the day before, he was tested for COVID-19.  Days later, the test came back negative. But regardless of the cause of death, funerals still must abide by rules aimed at preventing any possible exposure to the virus.  At Woodridge Memorial Park, a bottle of hand sanitizer and a sign asking guests to kindly refrain from handshaking now sits beside the guestbook. Chairs are spaced apart. Much of the funeral planning among family and staff is done via video chat. And the demand for livestreaming services has skyrocketed.  At Coleman's funeral, most of his family chose to sit in the front row, but a sister-in-law, citing social distance, made her way alone to the back. During the service, Gloria Coleman cried and pulled down her sunglasses, hiding her eyes. With the chairs separated, her sons couldn't reach out to comfort her.  “Your husband, your father, a model of faithfulness for you,\" Pastor Brett DeYoung said in his brief remarks. \"Now it’s time for you to continue that legacy by modeling that integrity and faithfulness to your family and friends.”  The family followed the casket outside, where two uniformed soldiers waited to honor Coleman’s service to his country — a ritual usually held inside, but moved to follow guidelines. A bugler played taps, and Gloria accepted a folded American flag.  John Coleman's wife and kids didn't make the trip from their Florida home. They were able to watch the livestream to say goodbye. Coleman said the family had to plan the funeral while watching headlines about the novel coronavirus, and he doesn't want to live in fear - that's why he invited The Associated Press to document their grieving.  He'll send the recording of the service to his dad's buddies from working for decades in the aerospace industry. And he'll head back home to his family.

John Bel Edwards says two of them have been confirmed by the CDC, as expected.  Edwards said eight parishes have seen presumptive positive COVID-19 cases, including one each in Bossier and Caddo parishes. 142 people in Louisiana have been tested so far for the virus.  “We’re seeing the numbers rise rapidly,” Edwards said, noting that Louisiana’s rate of presumptive positive cases per capita is among the highest in the country.  “We know that we have a relatively high number of cases based on our population. The latest reports, for example, out Texas show that they are reporting 39 cases, and they have six times our population, so the biggest concern that I have that it appears that if you look at cases per capita, we’re number 3 or number four in the country, something in that neighborhood, and certainly our ability to deliver services, particularly medical services, will be overwhelmed with a lower number of cases than would be required to have a similar impact on services in another state.”  The state’s elderly population remains the most vulnerable, the governor said, which is why all K-12 public schools have been closed and public gatherings of more than 250 people have been canceled for at least a month.  This includes churches with large congregations, he added. But Edwards noted that this does not apply to malls, grocery stores and other businesses.  “These mitigation steps are essential because what we have to do as a state now is minimize transmission and spread that peak demand out over a longer duration. Otherwise, we run the risk of overwhelming our ability to deliver proper healthcare.”  Edwards said state lawmakers have no plans for now to halt the annual legislative session.  “Right now the plan is to continue with the session to do its work.”  State Capitol visitors will have their temperatures taken at the door starting Monday.  On Friday, Edwards signed a proclamation closing all schools statewide until April 13. All of Louisiana’s higher education systems have moved courses online.  If you feel slightly sick, stay home, Edwards said.  “It’s time to be good neighbors to one another, and this is being a good neighbor,” he added.  Edwards said state agencies have been given authority to make the decision on whether employees can work remotely.  Basic public hygiene is still the best way to prevent the disease. Soap and water is more effective than hand sanitizer.  Edwards said officials remain vigilant in containing virus, which could mean possible extensions of closures in the coming weeks.  “This state has been tested and tried many times,” he said. “This test is a little different.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 12, "positive": 12, "negative": 3, "disgust": 2, "anger": 1, "fear": 2, "trust": 2}, "metadata": ["john", "noting", "texas", "reporting", "elderly", "gatherings", "canceled", "transmission", "peak", "statewide"]}, {"text": " Article content continued  Photo by Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press  Having wasted the opportunity to practice some caution, the Liberals now find themselves confronted by a global emergency. Trudeau has spent the week implementing a financial package Ottawa hopes will mitigate some of the impact of the virus. There will be support payments, tax deferrals, aid to business, moratoriums on debt, a boost in benefits, delays to tax payments, direct deposits to bank accounts and money for Indigenous communities. Some $82 billion in all, for now. Will it be enough? There’s no way of knowing. Will more be needed? Perhaps. It will all get tacked on top of spending plans that were already well past anything Canadians had been led to expect.  This government is not the first to blinker itself and suffer the result. Pierre Trudeau started the deficit ball rolling in the 1970s, and it grew to the point of crisis by the mid-1990s, when the Chrétien government was forced to act. Ten years later the Harper government inherited a healthy surplus. Instead of carefully shepherding its good fortune it opted for a slew of boutique tax benefits targeted at bolstering the Conservative brand among specific voting groups, until the 2008 meltdown came along and forced it, too, into a deficit-financed rescue effort.  Will it be enough? There’s no way of knowing  Once the panic subsided, Harper worked to bring the budget back to balance, under steady attack by self-styled progressives who see all spending increases as the new normal. Will Justin Trudeau do as much? Optimism in that regard would appear misplaced: this is a government that saw no need to control its spending when revenue was ample. Now it has an excuse to throw caution to the wind. The unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, the global span of its reach, the vast disparities in countries’ ability to deal with it, the cross-border nature of the world’s interconnected economies and the supply chains on which we have come to depend all make it impossible to know how long the reverberations will be felt, and how deeply into the fabric of society they will reach.

County officials have launched an unique online dashboard to give residents of the county a quick glance at the number of cases, gender of the victim, deaths and age groups the most vulnerable.  It also gives a graphical look at the surge over the last week. Santa Clara has had a Bay Area high of 848 residents test positive since the Silicon Valley reported the first local case in January. There were 202 new cases reported Monday — a surge accredited by county health officials to some delays in reporting cases and additional testing sites.  The county has also followed a national trend. While those 51 years old and older comprise just over 40 percent of the positive test results, that age group also accounts for nearly 95 percent of the county’s deaths.  And while men are barely outpacing women in positive tests — 53 percent to 46 percent — elderly males have accounted for a stunning 75 percent of the fatalities.  A similar pattern has emerged across the globe. Researchers say the gender imbalance shouldn’t really be a surprise: During previous outbreaks of SARS and MERS — cousins to COVID-19 — scientists noticed men seemed more susceptible than women.  This time around, slightly more than half the COVID-19 deaths in China were among men. Other parts of Asia saw similar numbers. Then Europe, too, spotted what Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus coordinator, labeled a concerning trend.  In Italy, where men so far make up 58% of infections, male deaths are outpacing female deaths and the increased risk starts at age 50, according to a report from Italy’s COVID-19 surveillance group.  The U.S. CDC hasn’t yet released nationwide details. But one report about the first nearly 200 British patients admitted to critical care found about two-thirds were male.  One suspect: Globally, men are more likely to have smoked more heavily and for longer periods than women. The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control is urging research into smoking’s connection to COVID-19.  Hormones may play a role, too. In 2017, University of Iowa researchers infected mice with SARS and, just like had happened in people, males were more likely to die. Estrogen seemed protective — when their ovaries were removed, deaths among female mice jumped, the team reported in the Journal of Immunology.  © Copyright 2020 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump signed an unprecedented $2.2 trillion economic rescue package into law Friday, after swift and near-unanimous action by Congress this week to support businesses, rush resources to overburdened health care providers and help struggling families during the deepening coronavirus epidemic.  Acting with unity and resolve unseen since the 9/11 attacks, Washington moved urgently to stem an economic free fall caused by widespread restrictions meant to slow the spread of the virus that have shuttered schools, closed businesses and brought American life in many places to a virtual standstill.  “This will deliver urgently needed relief,\" Trump said as he signed the bill in the Oval Office, flanked only by Republican lawmakers. He thanked members of both parties for putting Americans “first.”  Earlier Friday, the House of Representatives gave near-unanimous approval by voice vote after an impassioned session conducted along the social distancing guidelines imposed by the crisis. Many lawmakers sped to Washington to participate — their numbers swollen after a maverick Republican signaled he'd try to force a roll call vote — though dozens of others remained safely in their home districts.  The Senate passed the bill unanimously late Wednesday.  “The American people deserve a government-wide, visionary, evidence-based response to address these threats to their lives and their livelihood and they need it now,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.  The $2.2 trillion legislation will speed government payments of $1,200 to most Americans and increase jobless benefits for millions of people thrown out of work. Businesses big and small will get loans, grants and tax breaks. It will send unprecedented billions to states and local governments, and the nation's all but overwhelmed health care system.  “This pathogen does not recognize party lines, and no partisan solution will defeat it. Neither will the government acting alone,” said GOP Whip Liz Cheney of Wyoming. “This is not a time for cynicism or invective or second-guessing. This is a time to remember that we are citizens of the greatest nation on Earth, that we have overcome every challenge we have faced, and we will overcome this one.”  Despite reservations, arch conservatives joined with progressives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., to back the bill, which moved quickly through a Congress that’s been battered by partisanship and is itself not immune to the suffering the virus has caused. Rep. Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., announced Friday that he has tested positive, just the latest infection in Congress.  Tea party Republicans said government orders to shutter businesses merited actions that conflict with small-government ideology. Liberals accepted generous corporate rescues that accompany larger unemployment benefits, deferrals of student loans, and an enormous surge of funding for health care and other agencies responding to the crisis.  “I’m going to have to vote for something that has things in it that break my heart,” said conservative Rep. David Schweikert, R-Ariz.  Many lawmakers summoned the bipartisan spirit of 9/11 and efforts to fight terrorism. Others praised the roles low-income workers play in keeping the country going and the heroism of health care workers. Some, like Iowa Democrat Abby Finkenauer, who had just learned of two additional coronavirus-related deaths in her district, came close to tears.  Others couldn’t restrain their partisan impulses. Republicans chided Democratic leaders for delays and provisions they see as extraneous, such as funding for public broadcasting and the arts; Democrats said too many elements are a bailout for corporations that may not need it.  Still, in a chamber increasingly dominated by lawmakers whose chief skill often seems to be partisan attacks, Friday’s debate was a noteworthy break.  “We have no time to dither,\" said Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va. \"We have no time to engage in ideological or petty partisan fights. Our country needs us as one.”  The run-up to the vote contained an element of drama because libertarian conservative Thomas Massie, R-Ky., announced plans to seek a vote. The leaders of both parties united to prevent that because it would have forced lawmakers back to the Capitol or blemished their voting records if they stayed home. Instead, they made sure enough lawmakers would attend Friday's session to block Massie's move under the rules, and lawmakers took the unprecedented step of sitting in the visitors galleries to establish the necessary quorum.  The House promptly adjourned for a weeks-long recess but will return later in the spring to consider further legislation.  “This bill is not only a rescue package, it’s a commitment — a commitment that your government, and the people whom you elected to serve you, will do everything we can to limit the harm and hardship you face, both now and in the foreseeable future,” said Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.  The legislation will give $1,200 direct payments to individuals and make way for a flood of subsidized loans, grants and tax breaks to businesses facing extinction in an economic shutdown caused as Americans self-isolate by the tens of millions. It dwarfs prior Washington responses to crises like 9/11, the 2008 financial crisis, and natural disasters.  The massive CARES Act started as a draft plan among Republicans controlling the Senate who were seeking a greater voice in the coronavirus response efforts -- especially after Pelosi was a dominant force in earlier legislation imposing a sick leave mandate on businesses.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., welcomed Democratic participation a week ago, and signed off on a major expansion of unemployment insurance, but his efforts to freeze out Pelosi and force a quick agreement were met with Democratic demands for large infusions of aid to states and hospitals, as well as an assortment of smaller items. McConnell and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York wrestled for days, along with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other administration officials.  Negotiations finally produced a deal early Wednesday morning, and the Senate passed the measure by a 96-0 vote.  Key elements are untested, such as grants to small businesses to keep workers on payroll and complex lending programs to larger businesses. Rebate payments will go to people who have retained their jobs. Agencies like the Small Business Administration and state unemployment systems will be severely taxed, and conservatives fear that a new, generous unemployment benefit will dissuade jobless people from returning to the workforce.  The bill amounts to a bridge loan for much of the economy and carries a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget.  The legislation also establishes a $454 billion program for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries in hopes of leveraging up to $4.5 trillion in lending to distressed businesses, states, and municipalities.  There is also $150 billion devoted to the health care system, including $100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of COVID-19 caseloads.  It also seeks to strengthen the safety net for the poor and homeless. Schools and students would get relief, small business loans payments would be deferred. Evictions from public housing would be put on pause.  Republicans successfully pressed for an employee retention tax credit designed to help companies keep workers on payroll. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. A huge tax break for interest costs and operating losses limited by the 2017 tax overhaul was restored at a $200 billion cost in a boon for the real estate sector.  Most people who contract the new coronavirus have mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.   —  AP writer Zeke Miller contributed.

And when you add that to spending a lot of time in close quarters, it can lead to a dangerous situation.  Stress during the COVID-19 outbreak and self-isolation could lead to an increase in things like child abuse and domestic violence. That’s why Children’s Inn wants to remind everyone of the resources out there if anyone needs help.  “What I’m seeing and hearing across the country is that child abuse is increasing because, obviously, children are home more, parents are more stressed, parents might be leaving kids at home because they have work,” Amy Carter, the Operations Director for Children’s Inn said.  Carter says the challenge right now is children not having interaction with other adults like teachers or daycare providers who can check on them.  “Who can look out for the kids right now? They really are very much at home. So, I think maybe other family members are aware of what’s going on or have some concerns,” Carter said.  Carter says neighbors can watch for children outside who might be alone or seem like they don’t want to be at home.

When those kids are younger, it can be a challenge.  For Julie Tiffany of Deposit the idea of teaching younger kids isn't a new one.  \"I'm actually training to be a school teacher,\" she says.  Even so, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit and schools close, the idea of homeschooling her own son who is in kindergarten was a concept new to both of them.  \"The first few days I think my son thought it was kind of like a game and he was all for it,\" she says. \"Then the next week was when it kind of spiraled a bit and I had to figure out what the best way for him to learn was.\"  She says while the basis of that learning still comes from his homeroom teacher, one of the biggest benefits of homeschooling is that she is able to tailor the rest specifically to her own child.  For her son that means less time sitting at a desk and more time outside using play as a vehicle for learning.  \"Knowing that he likes construction I can take construction trucks and put it in front of him while he's learning adding and subtracting,\" she says. \"You just drive a car away if you're subtracting,\"  On the other hand Tiffany stresses that mother-son relationship does have it's drawbacks when it's time to learn.  \"I think the biggest challenge is trying to keep him on the view of I'm not just his mom anymore I'm his teacher and he tries to get away with a lot,\" she says.

The man has quite advanced dementia and has been quite inappropriately placed for months in the community hospital which is intended as part of a Covid-19 treatment outflow plan from a larger hospital in the area, she said.

As of now, he is running up \"significant debts\" in hospital \"when he does not need to be there\".

Alex Sawyer ran Priti Patel's office when she was international development secretary - until she was slammed for paying him tens of thousands of pounds to do so.  Priti had used her staffing allowance to pay Alex up to £25,000 a year to work part time from February 2014 until June 2017.  The Times revealed in May 2017 that Alex had been working as a marketing consultant for Nasdaq, the American stock exchange, for much of that time.  He also had a third paid role as a Conservative councillor in Bexley, South East London.  3 Priti Patel and Alex Sawyer married in 2004 and have one son, Freddie Credit: PA:Press Association  The register of MPs’ interests revealed that Alex stopped working for Priti after the General Election in June 2017.  The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority had banned politicians from taking on “connected” parties as staff.  However, Alex would have been able to continue working for Priti as those employed before the 2017 General Election were exempt from the rules.  According to The Times, Alex's role at Nasdaq was not declared on the register of interests for MPs’ staff because Alex said that he did not believe the company had “benefited or been advantaged by my parliamentary pass”.  Sir Alistair Graham, former chairman of the committee on standards in public life, said that there was a danger the public would think Mr Sawyer’s role as his wife’s parliamentary office manger “is a device to access public funds and boost the family income”.  3 Alex Sawyer and Priti Patel have one son Credit: Alpha Press  What does Alex Sawyer do?  Alex Sawyer is a marketing consultant for the American financial firm Nasdaq NLX, which is ranked second on the list of stock exchanges by market capitalisation of shares traded, behind only the New York Stock Exchange.

Patients who are hospitalized with the COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, will be eligible to join the trial if they have at least moderate symptoms. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik)  OMAHA, Neb. – The first clinical trial in the U.S. of a possible coronavirus treatment is underway in Nebraska and is eventually expected to include 400 patients at 50 locations around the world, officials said Tuesday.  Half of the patients in the international study will receive the antiviral medicine remdesivir while the other half will receive a placebo. Several other studies, including one looking at the same drug, are already underway internationally.  Dr. Andre Kalil, who will oversee the study at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, said the clinical trial was developed quickly in response to the virus outbreak that originated in China. Patients who are hospitalized with the COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, will be eligible to join the trial if they have at least moderate symptoms.  “The goal here is to help the people that need it the most,” Kalil said.  Fourteen people who were evacuated from a cruise ship in Japan are being treated at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Twelve of them have tested positive for COVID-19.

Doctors give patients fluids and pain relievers to try to ease the symptoms, which can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. In the case of those who are severely ill, doctors use ventilators to help them breathe or a machine that pumps and oxygenates their blood outside the body, easing the burden on the heart and lungs.  At least two patient studies are already underway in China, including the other study involving remdesivir, which is made by Gilead Sciences, and another that tests a combination HIV drug containing lopinavir and ritonavir.  In a draft research plan published last month, the World Health Organization said remdesivir was considered \"the most promising candidate.” It was used briefly in some Ebola patients in Congo before that study stopped. But the WHO cited laboratory studies that suggested it might be able to target SARS and MERS, which are cousins of the new virus.  Gilead has provided the drug for use in a small number of patients, including a man in Washington state who fell ill after a trip to Wuhan, the Chinese city at the center of the outbreak.

Here is how to do it and how it can help curb the COVID-19 pandemic. USA TODAY  Reconsidering federal regulations and public policies can give breweries across the country a fighting chance during the pandemic.  Bingeing \"Tiger King\" and working on a good beer buzz are the only two things we can all agree on. Headlines across the country have made it clear — Americans are drinking their way through the COVID-19 pandemic.  But behind bloodshot eyes, craft brewers across the United States are confronting a sobering reality. Unfortunately, this boom in alcohol sales has not translated to the thousands of small, local and independent brewers we have all come to love over the past few decades. While some alcohol producers have experienced historic sales spikes in recent weeks, a survey conducted by the Brewers Association reports that most breweries have seen sales plummet by at least 70%. The pain is so drastic that well over half of breweries indicate that they will not survive the next three months if they must continue operating under current conditions.  The ripple effects of this doomsday scenario cannot be overstated. Directly and indirectly, the U.S. beer industry employs 2 million people. It is the product of a long, interconnected value chain with critical economic implications; Michigan’s beer industry alone is worth nearly $1 billion.  For decades, barley growers have increasingly experimented with pioneering novel flavor profiles, and U.S. hop growers have obliged craft brewer requests for more and more hops. If more than half of the small, local and independent brewers were to instantaneously shut up shop, thousands of farmers across the country would also experience dire economic consequences.   The challenges breweries face  Prohibition is partly to blame for the uncompromising challenges confronted by America’s 8,000 modern-day breweries. While the 21st Amendment to the Constitution left alcohol regulation to state policymakers, restrictions in distribution channels were paramount to the policies promoted by the federal government.  Scholars at the time believed that severing relationships between breweries and drinkers would remove some of the more nefarious aspects of “tied house” beer halls. Even homebrewing was illegal in all states before the 1978 federal legislation signed by teetotaling President Jimmy Carter. Today, each state maintains its regulatory framework for booze, creating a tangled web of inconsistent bureaucratic instructions. On top of that, city governments also contribute to the morass of confusing production and distribution constraints.  What could help craft breweries navigate the regulatory quagmire in this time of unprecedented uncertainty? While “business as usual” remains beyond the horizon, some reconsiderations of these tangled public policies might give America’s craft breweries a fighting chance. The support offered by the CARES Act is likely to help, but in the face of complete evaporation of taproom demand, small business loans are like putting a Band-Aid on a bullet hole.   A fighting chance  In times where taprooms must remain vacant out of concern for public health, removing barriers for alternative distribution channels and product offerings should remain on top of the mind for policymakers keyed into preventing the collapse of America’s rich craft brewing culture. From the hopyard to the tasting room, tens of thousands of regulations influence each six-pack.  Our prior research suggests that allowing craft breweries to sell directly to consumers is likely to have positive effects on craft brewery growth. Many breweries have pivoted toward food and beer carryout, but distribution must be allowed to go further to maintain some reasonable revenue.  City councils like the one in Bristol, Tennessee, along with state governments in New Jersey and New York have passed temporary concessions that allow for beer delivery.  Chamber of Commerce president: This is how we reopen America  Some federal regulations are also worth reconsidering. For example, eliminating large spring gatherings such as March Madness and St. Patrick’s Day parades meant that thousands of barrels of beer went unsold. Because of the perishable nature of beer, regulations determining when a beer is “out of code” are going to cause many distributors to dump the product well before the beer goes bad. Relaxing these dates might provide some hope that more delicious beer won’t go to waste.  A brewery and pub in Seattle. (Photo: Elaine Thompson/AP)  Unfortunately, not all regulators have been as receptive to bending the rules. Perhaps most notabe, Pennsylvania’s state-owned liquor stores were closed in the middle of March, leading to a flood of bootleggers moving beer across the state line. Moving forward, anti-beer decisions such as these are likely to rewrite the nation’s beer geography. Talk about a buzz kill.

I wore a mask and gloves.  On March 19, I spent a few hours along Lady Bird Lake talking to the fitness enthusiasts who had flocked to the trail after local gyms shut their doors. They ran shoulder-to-shoulder and took turns using workout equipment in the park. I stood 6 feet away when I spoke with them, and sanitized everything I could. But from there, things started to go downhill. That night I developed a fever of nearly 102 degrees, but in the morning it was gone. But the following night, the fever came again, and, suddenly, the pain in my body was unbearable, as if a truck had hit me. Twice.  I still wanted to work, to document the unprecedented shutdown of our usually vibrant city. I spent three hours the next day, between midnight and 3 a.m. with no one around, documenting the shuttered storefronts of downtown Austin. The pain became excruciating. I knew something was wrong and wondered if I had the virus.  ► APRIL 3, 2020: Coronavirus: Florida family brings out Coronasaurus rex  That weekend I began to develop a dry cough and decided to seek medical attention. A nurse at an urgent care clinic suggested I fill out an online medical questionnaire from Baylor Scott & White, which diagnosed me as having some type of viral infection. I asked to be tested for the coronavirus, but instead they prescribed me some medication to numb my throat and lungs and told me to take Tylenol and rest. They even suggested a spoonful of honey to soothe my throat.  After the weekend, I felt somewhat better and because the doctors told me it was a common virus, I returned to work wearing a mask, gloves and kept distance from any subjects I photographed.  The night of March 24, the symptoms, especially my cough, started to get worse, to the point I could barely move throughout my apartment. Even going to the bathroom was a challenge, the shortest walk left me coughing uncontrollably and unable to catch my breath. I began to lose my sense of taste and smell. I texted my boss and she told me to work from home. I stayed home working on a video, assisting other photographers by translating some interviews done in Spanish.  ► CORONAVIRUS: Northwest Florida residents participate in ‘essential activities’  The next day, I was instructed via video chat to visit another clinic, where they would be able to X-ray my lungs and possibly test me for COVID-19. At the open-air clinic, a nurse said I still wasn’t meeting the criteria for a test, even though I had a history of asthma. She said they were reserving the limited supply of test kits for people older than 65 with severe medical conditions.  They sent me home with orders to take Tylenol, drink plenty of fluids and a gave me emergency inhaler that I should use as I needed it.  But at home, things got worse. My coughing fits would last 10 to 15 minutes. I began to lose weight because I had no appetite. My chest was in absolute pain. Sometimes I was coughing to the point that I was crying and vomiting. I felt as if my chest, head and eyes were going to explode.  ► APRIL 3, 2020: Tests of potential coronavirus vaccine spur growth of virus-fighting antibodies  I hardly moved for the next few days. Though my fever had subsided, my respiratory symptoms were getting worse. I slept for 12 hours a night. I lost 4 pounds in 10 days.  On March 28, I tried the digital questionnaire again with Baylor Scott & White but was again denied the test. They diagnosed me with acute bacterial sinusitis, gave me a prescription for an antibiotic and suggested more rest.  Nothing helped. I took puffs of my inhaler every 10 minutes, even though it’s only intended to be used twice a day. I needed help.  ► CORONAVIRUS FLORIDA: What is considered ‘essential’ in Gov. DeSantis’ stay-at-home order?  I hadn’t left my apartment since March 25, but on Tuesday, I made my fifth attempt at getting tested. At an open-air clinic the nurses said my vitals were out of control. I couldn’t stop coughing. They wanted to call an ambulance to take me to the emergency room, but I couldn’t afford the added cost. I drove myself down to the emergency room of St. David’s South Austin Medical Center.  On the way, I called my sister Laura, who lives in Florida. We were both crying. When I got to the ER, they were waiting for me.  As the doctors began to attend to me I couldn’t help but think, “This is it.” My chest was completely shut down, my body going numb from low oxygen levels. I felt as if an elephant was sitting on my chest. That moment was absolutely terrifying. I truly believed I was about to die.  ► APRIL 3, 2020: Coronavirus Florida: Pro-life groups pressure DeSantis to close abortion clinics  They stabilized me quickly and said they would try to test me. But an hour later, they said I couldn’t get a test. They wanted to send me home, for the fifth time. I was exhausted, both mentality and physically, but I didn’t budge. Eventually, they agreed to test me, which requires someone shoving a long cotton swab deep into my nose to reach the back of my throat. I cried out in pain when they did it.  The next morning, the test came back positive.  I’m normally a healthy 42-year-old. I run at least 6 miles every day, take good care of myself and don’t smoke. As a photojournalist, I consider it my duty to run toward the fire, rather than away from it, but my colleagues and I have put ourselves at grave risk to document what is happening to our town.  ► CORONAVIRUS in FLORIDA: Residents and visitors yearning for sand between toes  I know medical personnel are doing everything they can to help, but this crisis is serious, it’s real, and it’s going to affect all of us.

Exxon Mobil Corp. reports earnings Friday, Feb. 2, 2018. (AP Photo/Ben Margot)  Journalists have not been handling Donald Trump’s time as president very well, and the COVID-19 situation has broken them even further beyond repair. There is such a thing as necessary fact-checking, though as a former newspaper editor and editor of quite a few digital journalism pieces, I can assure you that, in theory, the fact-checking is something reporters are supposed to be doing quite often.  However, many reporters are conflating “fact-checking” and “dunking” on people they don’t like – namely, Trump and Republicans – in their efforts to hold the powerful accountable after years of softballing it to the Democrats.  On Sunday, Trump mentioned that he’d seen some places selling gas as low as 91 cents per gallon, which is extraordinary, but understandable. With shelter-in-place orders across the country, people are not driving as much, and it is leading to higher supply. Those of us who understand economics know when supply is up and demand is down, then prices go down.  In fact, you can look it up quite easily. Websites like GasBuddy and others will actually show you where you can find gas that cheap. It takes approximately thirty seconds, depending on the speed of your internet. Now, if you’re a reporter who thinks 91 cents per gallon is questionable, the best thing to do is look up specific areas.  Now, that might take some time if you don’t know places like GasBuddy exist. So, you do a quick Google search of “gas prices around the U.S.” and the first site to come up is the AAA. If you look there, you’ll find gas averages.  At this point, you have two choices. The correct choice would be to find specific locations with gas prices at 91 cents per gallon. It will take a little more research, but hey, journalism is all about finding the truth. The incorrect choice is to say “Well, the average is $1.97, so it Trump can’t be right,” and post the national average.  James Hohmann, a national correspondent for the Washington Post chose the incorrect path, if you can believe it.  A national political correspondent for the @washingtonpost does not understand that seeing some places selling gas for 91 cents per gallon is not saying the national average is 91 cents per gallon. pic.twitter.com/8eNdq1HCP4 — Joe Cunningham (@JoePCunningham) April 6, 2020  As you might guess, a good many people pointed out that local gas prices and the national average are not comparable. Places in Minnesota and Ohio are quite rural and don’t see much traffic. Gas there is not going to be nearly as high as, say, Washington D.C., where Hohmann lives.  When called out on it, he acts as though it’s a tiny mistake and that he wasn’t trying to dunk on Trump.  When told his tweet was misleading (at best), he deflects and pretends he wasn’t trying to dunk at all. pic.twitter.com/0FAzFQgLMr — Joe Cunningham (@JoePCunningham) April 6, 2020  Except, if he weren’t trying to do that, then there is no point for the original tweet at all. Hohmann, by pointing out the difference, is trying to say that something Trump is saying is absurd. The tweet has no purpose if he were not trying to imply that with his “reporting.” It is very apparent that this was meant to be a dunk, and after a couple hours of getting counter-dunked on, Hohmann posts this silly explanation instead of correcting himself.  This is why people have such a hard time giving the media any credit. It’s why Trump’s approval rating is higher than theirs. People are tired of journalists degrading themselves by letting personal emotion make them look and act stupid on social media and on television. There is a major crisis going on, and the best some of these so-called defenders of democracy can do is provide piss-poor fact checks that an eighth-grade math student can tell you are bad analysis.  And yet, for all their talk about holding the President accountable when he lies, they will never admit they made any mistakes. They will never admit they have been wrong. They are in their own special cult and you, especially those of you who live in rural America where you likely see gas prices hovering at or below one $1.00 per gallon, don’t have the right to address their flaws. They’ll always look down on you because they are The Media. They are the reporters who give you the information they think you need to know. And, by God, if we say Trump can’t be right about gas prices being 91 cents per gallon because the national average is $1.97, then you just accept it and admit the President is wrong, or else you’re an ignorant rube.  Don’t buy into their nonsense. Hold them accountable.

As resources run thin, hospital staffers are forced to be resourceful.  \"They are all reusing masks,\" Sauer said. \"They are all sending fewer staff to care for patients, putting patients with COVID together, so you can use the same P.P.E. multiple times.

To avoid COVID-19 charity scams, consumers should:  Deflect attempts of telemarketers to rush or pressure you into donating to a nonprofit, charity, or fundraiser related to COVID-19. Before making a donation, research the charity to verify its legitimacy. Visit the Office of the Attorney General’s Tips on Charitable Giving for a list of questions to ask when solicited.  Do not make donations in cash, gift cards, or money wires.  Some Kentucky charities are required to register and report donations with the Office of the Attorney General.

While the pandemic has not reached its zenith in Springfield — and not expected to until mid-May — health care officials are responding to the local shortage. On April 6, the CoxHealth Foundation wrote on Facebook, “CoxHealth is accepting homemade masks. We need them NOW!” (emphasis theirs). The community response has been outstanding, with many people and organizations making and donating masks to local health care organizations.  While homemade masks help prevent the spread of COVID-19 by people infected, they are of limited benefit to the physicians and nurses treating patients. They need N95 respirators, face shields and gowns. On April 7, CoxHealth CEO Steve Edwards tweeted, “We need federal intervention… supply is disrupted and filled with profiteering middlemen… these PPE can save (lives).” His tweet noted the astronomical cost increases in PPE. On top of the cost, states and facilities are having to bid against each other for the limited PPE that is available.  Businesses and individuals have been implored to donate any PPE they have for use by health care workers, and many have responded, yet news reports are full of stories about medical personnel wearing the same PPE for an entire shift and even having to resort to using those homemade masks while treating patients because of the shortage.  Now we learn that Missouri Representative Curtis Trent (R-133) recently secured over 300 N95 masks and offered two each to members of the Missouri House of Representatives rather than donate those to the people who are saving lives in his own community of Springfield.  Is the Missouri legislature — which meets part-time for five months a year and can do much of its business remotely — more important than our health care workers during a pandemic? Could they not make do with homemade masks so that our physicians and nurses are protected? They can practice 6-foot social distancing; our heroes on the front lines can’t. They risk exposure every day.  Is Curtis Trent, who has refused to expand Medicaid in Missouri, leaving more of our people without health care, who puts himself and others ahead of our health care workers, the kind of person we want representing us in Jefferson City? I think not.  When this is over, let’s honor all those who have given so much. But let’s not forget those who looked out for themselves first.   Gene Davison, Springfield  Fighting COVID-19 in Missouri requires a uniform response  Where are those today who would say: “Government is not the solution. Government is the problem.”  President Ronald Reagan was popular on the screen and in the Oval Office. And he did accomplish some good things with Mikhail Gorbachev, such as an arms control agreement and removing the Berlin Wall. But his remark denouncing the importance of our government was a disservice to the nation.  Governor Parson has the same conservative mindset. His order to let each of the counties in the state do as they wish to combat the virus is clueless leadership.  No uniformity, no leadership! Greene County’s health director, Clay Goddard, is frustrated. Effective action requires that everyone act in unison and uniformly. Folks from small populated counties do travel to metropolitan areas and vice versa. Allowing freedom of movement and “everyone has to take responsibility” is normally desirable, but when life and death are at stake, it’s a different ball game, governor.  When voting this November, remember Teddy Roosevelt and Harry Truman. Missouri and America need leadership in these critical times. Decisive and wise leadership that seeks and follows the advice of experts. Leaders that think of the people first and not their next election. Leaders that are willing to say “The Buck Stops Here!”   Fred L. Hall, Springfield  Parson is still right — it will take personal responsibility  April is the cruelest month, breeding  Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing   Memory and desire, stirring  Dull roots with spring rain.  – T.S. Eliot, The Waste Land  This April will no doubt be the cruelest in recent memory as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to insidiously spread across the country from one city to another, infecting neighbor to neighbor.  And now, the inevitable statewide stay-at-home order from Governor Mike Parson. It was the right thing to do. While it may not change behavior significantly, it does send a unifying message: No one is completely isolated from this virus, and everyone is going to have to sacrifice something to help slow its spread.  Never mind that Parson has been right from the start. It will be personal responsibility that ensures the success of any stay-at-home order. See this paper’s recent reports about the difficulties of enforcing the city’s own order that has already been in place for two weeks.  Cynics will say that Parson caved to political pressure. But the one who makes the decision has far more to worry about than politics. For every business shuttered, there are more people out of work, and there is less revenue for the state. Those are the same revenues that pay for bridges, our schools, and care for the most vulnerable members of our society. Those revenues are down 4% for the month of March compared to last year and falling perilously fast. Before criticizing for acting “too late,” one should consider that many thousands of people will be hurt by our inability to fund certain programs in the future.  The unknown and quickly changing nature of the pandemic also requires policymakers to make new decisions if needed, notwithstanding the Twitter echo chamber. It wasn’t that long ago that experts told us that masks were unnecessary and would not protect us or others. Now the Centers for Disease Control recommends “wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.”  As if one needed a reminder that the world has changed, there are the sobering new screening protocols at the entryway of every hospital. Temperature checks and a long list of questions about symptoms and travel. There is also the new feeling of guilt at using personal protective equipment (PPE), those thin paper masks and gowns that used to be an afterthought and usually a nuisance. Now every piece of PPE used today is one that may not be available for a future outbreak as severe as those seen in New York, where more than 3,500 people have died from the virus.  The numbers are sobering, so too are the actual human stories playing out in our hospitals. “I had to work the COVID unit at [a hospital],\" says one respiratory therapist who works at a local hospital. “We had one patient die, one right after the other… And when they die there is no warning; it just happens.”  For the sake of those front-line doctors, nurses and respiratory therapists in harm’s way, Missourians should heed Parson’s call to do the one thing that is known to reduce the spread of the virus — stay at home and save lives. Otherwise, the cruelest months may be yet to come.  State Rep. Jon Patterson, chairman of the Special Committee on Disease Control and Prevention, Jefferson City   The Democrats did it!

While Democrats were working for the people, Republicans were busily starting military conflicts, increasing wealth disparity with tax cuts, and perfecting propaganda promoting divisive partisanship by villainizing Democrats.  At a time when American unity should be paramount fighting the pandemic, Trump's idea of leadership means monopolizing press briefings in an attempt to replace his canceled political rallies — clearly demonstrating his leadership incompetence. He spews out vicious attacks on all who challenge him, like a Missouri honey wagon in a hayfield — feeding his base.  Warned as early as November in his daily briefings about the pandemic in China, he chose to ignore warnings in favor of protecting the economy — GOP = greed over people. His delay cost thousands of American lives.  If you receive unemployment, assistance from FEMA, the SEC, FDIC, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, or the Family and Medical Leave Act during the pandemic, thank a Democrat, because the Democrats did it!   Jan Lancaster, Springfield  No-limit economic growth an unfeasible approach that harms the environment  The first Earth Day 50 years ago was an awakening to the environmental abuse that an ever-expanding population and economic impact were having on the world. The Clean Air, Clean Water and Endangered Species Acts were products of that awakening. Population growth was recognized as a driver of those problems but was ultimately tabooed because it was also a driver of economic growth. Simon and Garfunkel captured the essence of this in the song The Sound of Silence: “and the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they made.” Economists refused to accept that there were limits to growth and continued to advocate for a perpetually growing Gross Domestic Product (GDP).  By the 1980 election, Republicans had begun to abandon their former support for environmental regulations in favor of removing them as barriers to economic growth. Today, such regulations are under constant attack. The amazing thing about all of this is that the economists, who are university graduates, continue to adhere to the mythology that perpetual growth is possible and have consequently done virtually nothing to work toward a stable no-growth economy.  So, as another Earth Day approaches, we have global warming, water shortages, overpopulation, a migration crisis, an increased likelihood of pandemics, antibiotic resistance, agriculture that depends on blight-prone monocultures, and wild lands and species throughout the world being sacrificed, all for worship of the god of GDP growth. To make matters worse, our leadership now ignores facts as fake news and is moving rapidly to dismantle fact-based regulation.  There is a lot to think about on this Earth Day, including the reality of limits to growth and how to stay within them. Denying facts may provide a temporary sense of euphoria and make us feel good, but denying facts is no recipe for a sustainable future.   Norman W. Youngsteadt, Springfield  Veterans and Consumers Fair Credit Act helps people by reducing predatory lending  At a time of unprecedented economic crisis brought on by the global coronavirus pandemic, Americans need access to fair credit. Currently before the U.S. Congress, the federal Veterans and Consumers Fair Credit Act (H.R. 5050) does just that, extending a 36% APR rate cap (all fees included) to every American in need of a short term loan. This legislation is especially needed in the Show-Me State because Missouri payday lenders charge an average of 450% APR and are allowed to charge over 1,900%. Exploitation of our most vulnerable neighbors is immoral and should be illegal. The Veterans and Consumer Fair Credit Act is an extension of the protections offered to our active military in the bipartisan Military Lending Act of 2007. We need our U.S. Representatives to act now because predatory short-term lenders (payday, car title, installment loans) will not wait to exploit people in economic crises due to job losses and the uncertainty of the global pandemic. We need our congressional leaders to act now to ensure just credit for all.  The Veterans and Consumers Fair Credit Act (VCFCA) would eliminate high-cost, predatory payday loans, auto-title loans, and similar forms of credit in all 50 states by:  Reestablishing a simple, commonsense limit on predatory lending. Similar to speed limits and seat belt laws, expanding the DOD’s 36% interest rate cap would simply reestablish state usury laws that were in force in virtually every state throughout the 20th century.  Preventing hidden fees and loopholes. The 36% rate cap is based on the Pentagon’s successful rules that include all additional fees or add-ons. A federal law is necessary to stop evasive and deceptive lending practices and protect all Americans.  Preserving access to credit. The DOD’s approach is time-tested and proven. Active duty service members are still obtaining all the credit they need from banks, credit unions, finance companies, fintech companies, and retailers.  Maintaining low industry compliance costs from compromise rules already in effect. Compliance costs for the payday loan industry will be low because creditors already understand how to comply for active duty military and their families.  Upholding stronger state protections. States like Arkansas, South Dakota, North Carolina, Colorado, New Hampshire and Montana already have strong interest rate caps. Existing laws will not be impacted because the VCFCA bill does not preempt any provision of state law that provides greater protections to consumers.  Please call U.S. House Representative Billy Long and ask him to support H.R. 5050, the Veterans and Consumers Fair Credit Act. In this time of economic crisis, all Missourians deserve dignity and protection from exploitative interest rates.  Susan Schmalzbauer, Congregational Coordinator, Faith Voices of Southwest Missouri, Springfield  Democrats make terrible choice nominating \"Sleepy\" Joe Biden for president  Well, Uncle Bernie, the old communist, finally saw the light and dropped out. The Dems were thinking he might be their nominee a few months ago. It never occurred to them that they might actually have to settle for Biden. To their dismay, Biden has emerged from a long list of unqualified wannabes to become the victor. Now they’re stuck with a corrupt old man with dementia ... a loser who never even won a primary in two previous attempts. Somehow, Sleepy has now become the presumptive Democratic nominee. I can’t imagine him being in control of the country. He doesn't even know what state he's in most of the time.  Biden has promised to pick a woman for his running mate. There are definitely some qualified women out there, but I will be surprised if he makes the right pick. Most Dems won’t even show up at the polls in November unless he picks a strong running mate. They might as well stay home.  COVID-19 reared its ugly head at just the right time for Sleepy. Instead of going head to head with Trump, it has enabled him to avoid any public exposure while his handlers are desperately trying to figure out what to do going forward. Now he just hides out in the basement of his Delaware mansion and reads from his teleprompter when he's not napping. Bernie's Bolshevic brigade could potentially cause problems for Sleepy but I think that is unlikely. Biden's handlers will make sure they keep the peace and salvage as many of Bernie's followers as possible by simply including most of Bernie's socialist crap in their platform, thereby avoiding a riot.  The Dems need to continue to hide Sleepy in his basement if they are to have any chance at all of prevailing in the November election.   Andy Fischer, Springfield  Some of Trump's remarks during COVID-19 crisis deserve bipartisan rejection  Though it will be obvious I am no Trump fan, I think there are certain commonalities among us regarding acceptable conduct, conduct that does not embarrass or disgust us whether it be done by a Democratic or Republican president. The specific remarks below should meet that criteria.  Mr. Trump’s declaration the fed is “not a shipping clerk” is one. How many of us would cringe had any state been told after a hurricane they needed to find their own way without federal attention? His declaration he didn’t want “too many expensive ventilators sitting around” after this pandemic ends is another. Trying to balance ventilators to the last needed is a fool’s errand. Simply, there is no such thing as an excess ventilator. Rural hospitals and the national stockpile are clearly locations that will benefit from an excess. Insufficiency only produces death. The president’s insistence that states be “nice or he won’t call” is perhaps the most egregiously ugly statement. No governor and no citizen should ever be denied federal assistance because their governor is not suitably subservient. Regardless of actual performance, the mere remark was a disgusting display of childish petulance. Another particularly troubling assertion was the president’s claim New York’s demands for masks indicated they were being slipped out the back door. There is absolutely no evidence that is happening, and I can see no reason any health care worker in that horror would endanger his fellow workers. In an MSA of 20-plus million, 300,000 masks are nothing. Another was his scree that specifically Democratic states just “take, take, take.” This is a meme that won’t die. New York is a top five state receiving 86 cents for every federal tax dollar paid. Top five “takers” are “red” states.  I hope that, despite party affiliation, codes still exist. I know I would condemn any Democratic president so conducting themselves.

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced Friday that roughly 160 active-duty soldiers will be deployed at two ports of entry along the southern border to assist the agency. Around 80 personnel will be sent to El Paso, while another 80 will be sent to California.  The administration’s decision to deploy military police support stems from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision to block Migrant Protection Protocols — a program that keep thousands of asylum seekers in Mexico — in California and Arizona beginning March 12.  Senior CBP officials, in a conference call with reporters on Friday, cited concerns that the court decision will not only instigate a large-scale influx of migrants that the agency will be unable to control, but also pointed to the possible spread of coronavirus at the border.  “As demonstrated last Friday, following the 9th Circuit’s [Migrant Protection Protocol] ruling announcement, the balancing between facilitating the flow of legitimate trade and travel while upholding our national border security mission and the safety of the public and our personnel is delicate,” a senior CBP official said Friday.  “CBP ports of entry are not designed or equipped to handle extremely large groups of travelers arriving at the same time, and temporary closure of a [port of entry] is contemplated as an extreme option as necessary for public safety and border security,” the official continued.  The move marks a back-and-forth between the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and the administration.  The federal appeals court on February 28 blocked the administration’s Migrant Protection Protocols — also known as the Remain in Mexico program — across the entire southern border. This led to a large number of migrants rushing the border, and prompted U.S. immigration officials to temporarily shut the border down.  The court ruling was quickly put on hold, allowing the program to remain in place. However, on Wednesday the court ruled that it will block the program down in Arizona and California — two states under its jurisdiction — beginning on March 12, unless the Supreme Court weighs in beforehand.  The Department of Justice has issued a stay application with the Supreme Court, but it’s not clear if the nation’s highest court will act before the due date.  “Based on the pending [Migrant Protection Protocol] decision, continued concerns of large groups attempting to enter through [ports of entry], and COVID-19 containment and mitigation concerns, CBP has activated the crisis response force,” the senior CBP official said. This force will provide military police support, engineering support, and aviation support, the official noted.  The crisis response force will be deployed “no later than March 7” and last for two weeks.

And yes—it’s probably because so many people are stuck at home watching television during the coronavirus pandemic.  Tubi users spent more than 42 million hours streaming programming from March 14-21, and in the past two weeks its total users are up 22%, according to new data provided exclusively to Adweek by the streaming service. In the same two-week time period, Tubi has seen a 50% spike in new users.  All three figures are records for the AVOD streamer, which was founded in 2014. Tubi previously said that as of last December, it had 25 million monthly active users.  The metrics underscore the rapid growth in viewership that many streamers are seeing as people are being told to stay at home to slow COVID-19’s spread. Industrywide, the number of new unique streaming viewers is up 25% since Jan. 31, according to the TV measurement firm Alphonso.  “What we’re facing [with COVID-19] is unprecedented here and is hopefully something we bounce back quickly from, but what’s very unique is how most of the country is sheltering in place at home and looking for new things to do—not just for themselves but for their families,” said chief revenue officer Mark Rotblat. “The growth we’re seeing now really puts a focal point around the places where we’ve already been having some growth for some time.”  Tubi first began seeing a considerable uptick in viewership two weekends ago, the first weekend without live sports programming in decades after the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball canceled competitions in an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus among attendees, players and staff alike. That tracks with other recent data from Inscape, which recently said that regular sports fans spent 47% more time streaming that weekend.  Since then, Tubi viewership has only continued to rise. Growth was especially large for viewers in the 13-17 and 18-24 demos, a trend that Rotblat attributed to kids and college-aged adults being home from school or spring break and having more time to watch programming than usual. Other factors Rotblat said contributed to Tubi’s growth included more people being at home during the week and streaming shows during weekdays and on weeknights when they would otherwise be out.  Top titles on the service are all movies, including the comedies Little Man and The 51st State; action films like Marauders and Gods of Egypt; and family movies like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Four of Tubi’s top 10 performing titles last Saturday—ranked by total viewing time—are AVOD exclusives, meaning that the films are only available to watch for free on Tubi’s service.  “With the influx of new viewers, part of what we’re seeing is that they’re starting with the things they can’t find anywhere else, and then from that are being recommended other titles that interest them,” Rotblat said.  Advertiser interest among delivery services is up, and telcos and financial services firms are still spending steadily on the platform, Rotblat said, but travel industry spend and entertainment spend on things like theatrical movie releases and amusement parks have expectedly dropped off.  For other advertisers working with the streamer, the challenge remains for brands and agencies to navigate the new normal and figure out long-term advertising strategies as the ground continues to shift under their feet.  “We’re finding that our agency partners are in war room-type situations every morning with their clients because clients are just trying to figure out what to do,” Rotblat said. “Some clients’ entire businesses might be around collecting groups of people together, so the question is how long this will last. Other people are having production concerns because people can’t manufacture their products, so they might be putting advertising on hold.”  Tubi hasn’t altered its marketing or library acquisition strategy as a result of the pandemic, Rotblat said, nor has it made major changes to ad spend in recent weeks.  “We’ve certainly had discussions about it, but it’s one of these things where while we want people to be aware of the service that we have, we also want to make sure we’re striking the right tone,” Rotblat said. “This is a very difficult time for people and so we’re fortunate that we’ve always been focused on the fact that we’re free and we’re entertainment, and a lot of people are looking for escape right now.”  As the fallout from coronavirus continues to ripple through the entertainment and media industries at large, Tubi is well-insulated against some of the immediate effects on production and development since it doesn’t produce original content of its own.  The way that the Fox acquisition will affect the streamer, too, isn’t immediately clear. The company is prohibited from changing its messaging or go-to-market strategy as it relates to Fox prior to the deal’s anticipated closure, which is no later than June 30.

Islamabad has told a visiting team of a UNSC monitoring committee that it had been unable to act against numerous individuals listed in its sanctions list because the UN panel had given “insufficient information”.  The UNSC 1267 Sanctions List has 130 names from Pakistan.  Islamabad, however, acknowledges the presence of only 19 of them including Lashkar-e-Taiba founder Hafiz Saeed. It has already moved the UNSC to delist 6 terrorists including Matiur Rehman, described in UN records of 2013 as the chief operational commander of terror group Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, a top official in North Block that houses India’s internal security establishment said.  The UN analytical support and sanctions monitoring team, which was on a five-day visit to Pakistan in March, was told that the UN Sanctions List did not have the accurate date of birth, nationality, national ID number, passport number or a specific address of the men sanctioned for their terror links.  Pakistan had put out a similar set of explanations when it was asked about the deletion of 3,800 names from its domestic terror watch list.  In October 2018, Islamabad showed off this list to the counterterror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force to demonstrate that it was coming down heavily on terrorists. This terror watch list, according to FATF records, then had 7,600 names of terrorists.  Indian counterterror officials suggested that the effort to prune Pakistan’s terror watch list is a more recent development.  The deletions were first spotted by Castellum AI, a New York-headquartered tech firm that tracks watch lists globally. In a statement in April, the tech firm started by a former US treasury department official said many of the names were removed sometime after October 2018. But there were about 1,069 names in the watch list that were deleted between March 9-27. Another 800 names were removed after March 27.  “This means the process to delete the names started the day the UNSC monitoring team landed in Pakistan,” a counterterror operative told Hindustan Times. The UNSC monitoring team was in Pakistan from March 9-13.  Indian officials said they had not been able to access the details of the UNSC panel’s visit but had learnt that the UNSC panel did convey, on March 18, that Pakistan could file requests for delisting “inappropriate” names from the UNSC sanctions list.  Pakistan hopes to get the support of the Chinese in this endeavour given how Beijing had blocked an international effort to designate Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist for years. Beijing eventually had to give in last year but started backing Islamabad’s attempts to include Indian professionals working in Afghanistan in the UNSC 1267 list.  Also Read : ‘Brief the boss’: The backstory of Masood Azhar’s global terror tag  The exercise to get names of terrorists deleted, a top source in the internal security establishment said, appears to be driven by the desperation to stay out of the FATF’s black list. Pakistan has been on the terror financing watchdog’s grey list since June 2018 and faces the risk of being placed in the black list if it does not demonstrate that it was really acting against terrorists.  “By getting rid of half of the proscribed entities, Pakistan authorities attempted to reduce its obligation to freeze the assets of such entities,” the source said.  The FATF, which was due to review the status of steps taken by Pakistan, has pushed the meeting by four months in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.  In any case, officials said, Pakistan had always kept out the most prominent of the terrorists that it supports out of the watch list.  Top terrorist leaders who had been designated by the UNSC such as the Lashkar-e-Taiba’s chief operations commander and 26/11 Mumbai attacks mastermind Zaki ur Rehmani Lakhvi have always stayed out of Pakistan’s terror list. So did Dawood Ibrahim and others such as Mohammed Yahya Mujahid, head of LeT’s media department (sanctioned in 2009) and LeT co-founder and Hafiz Saeed’s deputy Hafiz Abdul Salam Bhuttavi.

With less than a month to go, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced his company is canceling its annual Global Marketing Summit because of continued spread and concern of the virus.  “There is a concern, especially when you have an event that attracts people that travel back and forth to china,” said tech expert Larry Magid. “It’s a big deal for Facebook. And not having it is a very big deal.”  Facebook media relations chief Anthony Harrison says, “Our priority is the health and safety of our teams, so out of an abundance of caution, we canceled our Global Marketing Summit due to the evolving public health risks related to coronavirus.”  The coronavirus disease began late last year in Wuhan, China, and has since infected more than 64,000 people in at least 29 countries.  The Global Marketing Summit would have pumped over $11M into San Francisco’s economy. 5,000 attendees had made plans at 10 different city hotels.  “I am disappointed that Facebook is pandering to fear,” said San Francisco District 3 Supervisor Aaron Peskin.

While some politicians and health experts say the risk of infection is low and that Facebook is overreacting, one infectious disease expert says this move by the multi-billion dollar company is prudent.  “This isn’t panic. I think this is just a matter of scale,” said Stanford Hospital epidemiologist Dr. Bonnie Maldonado.  She says screening a dozen people for coronavirus is one thing. But keeping track of thousands of people traveling internationally is much harder.  “We don’t have evidence of circulation of the virus in the US, but we could easily have circulation in the US if somebody came into the country unmonitored and walked around and spread the virus,” said Dr. Maldonado. Added Magid, “I think a lot of companies are falling in line, and even organizations. Some have canceled Chinese New Year’s events in Palo Alto.”  Facebook executives promise their Global Marketing Summit will return next year.

The veterinarian diagnosed him with FIP - feline infectious peritonitis, which is caused by a coronavirus that is unique to cats.  \"When she gave me the diagnosis she handed me five vials, five syringes with some pain medicine and said, 'keep him calm, keep him comfortable, and bring him back when you want to euthanize him,'\" Kim recalls.

Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. He's been researching coronaviruses for more than 40 years.  In his most recent study, he successfully treated FIP in 25 of 31 cats using GS-441524. He says the drug works by blocking the virus’s ability to replicate.  \"It very clear that GS-441524 is highly effective against coronavirus infection in cats,\" he explained. \"It’s the virus-infected cells that are producing all of these nasty cytokines that are causing this inflammation so if you can stop the replication cold in its tracks you're going to immediately stop the cytokines from being produced.\"  GS-441524 is very similar to the experimental human drug, Remdesivir and patents for both are held by manufacturer Gilead.  Remdesivir has already been used to treat a Seattle man infected with a different coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Although they can't say for sure that the medication worked, his condition improved one day after receiving the intravenous drug.  Remdesivir is now being used in a clinical trial in China to treat patients with COVID-19 but Pedersen says Gilead is not developing GS-441524 for humans.  But because the two drugs are so similar, he wonders if Remdesivir would work in cats and if GS could work for humans.  \"I am kind of amazed but I'm also worried what will happen to the cats if people decide to start using the GS made for cats to treat humans,\" Pedersen says.  Kim says the rescue paid $7,000 to treat the two kittens and that pet owners around the world are also paying thousands for the supplement. She hopes by shedding a light on the plight of cat owners the manufacturer will realize there's a market for GS for cats.  \"There is a viable option that death is not required from this disease but it's just not known,\" Kim says. \"We want to get it off the black market, we want to get this thing mainstream.\"  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 9, "positive": 10, "negative": 7, "disgust": 3, "joy": 3, "anger": 8, "fear": 2, "trust": 2}, "metadata": ["florida", "diagnosed", "infectious", "coronavirus", "diagnosis", "treating", "dose", "cats", "cytokines", "remdesivir", "infected", "china", "pet"]}, {"text": "CHICAGO (AP) - Hundreds of Chicago voters who went to the polls in last month’s primary were being notified of possible exposure to COVID-19 including from a site where a poll worker later developed symptoms and died, election officials said Monday.  Illinois was one of the first states that grappled with rescheduling its March 17 primary during the coronavirus pandemic but proceeded despite safety concerns. Days later, Gov. J.B. Pritzker issued a statewide stay-at-home order.  The Chicago Board of Election Commissioners was sending letters to voters who went to the polls at four locations throughout the city, spokesman Jim Allen said, with at least one more possible location. Either poll workers or voters who later tested positive were at those locations and notified the board. Election officials didn’t have an exact count but said hundreds of letters were being sent.  Chicago Board of Elections officials said a poll worker at a South Side church who used as a voting site developed symptoms days after the election and died April 1. He was a 60-year-old city employee, according to WMAQ-TV.  Illinois State Board of Elections spokesman Matt Dietrich said he had not received similar reports in other parts of the state.  Allen had publicly blasted Pritzker’s office on Election Day for proceeding, but he declined to discuss it Monday.  “The important thing is to move forward with plans for November and try to plan accordingly,” he said. “That’s what’s on the mind of every election administration everywhere.”  The letters note the board “took every precaution possible” but that there was risk of exposure and advise voters to contact election officials if they test positive.  Dr. Allison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health, said the incubation period for the coronavirus is believed to be a maximum of 14 days, with five days as more typical. Arwady said she wasn’t concerned about something “that occurred more than 14 days ago leading to infection at this point.”  Pritzker, a first-term Democrat, said holding the election wasn’t a perfect solution and had pushed early voting and voting by mail as safer alternatives. Since then more than a dozen states have postponed their primaries. Wisconsin tried to delay last week’s primary, but proceeded anyway.  Pritzker said Monday that the governor doesn’t have the constitutional power to shut down an election and Illinois officials provided hand sanitizer and whatever help was requested from local election jurisdictions. Election officials have said that they wiped down equipment between voters and supplied judges with gloves, though election judges have said it wasn’t consistent at every polling place.  “We were encouraging people not to go to the polls if they could avoid going to the polls, and indeed I think that’s exactly the same thing that we need to do even more so when we get to the general election,” Pritzker said during his Monday coronavirus briefing.  Pritzker said he would push widespread mail voting for November, something that Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot echoed on Monday.  “What’s very clear to me is we cannot have a repeat of what happened on March 17 meaning we have to put in place every measure that we can to really place an emphasis on voting by mail,” Lightfoot said.   ___  Associated Press writers Kathleen Foody and John O’Connor in Springfield contributed to this report.   __  Follow Sophia Tareen on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sophiatareen.

The coronavirus pandemic put sports on hold and the AAU circuit with it, leaving non-elite basketball recruits with no opportunity to make an in-person impression on college coaches,  Murphy opted to take the most sensible road rather than try sorting through the uncertainty, committing to play at the Air Force Academy, where his brother was already a cadet.  “I think if I could have played in front of more coaches, there’s always the chance of a very different outcome,” Murphy said. “But with how everything went and kind of happened, I feel like this is how it’s supposed to be.”  The spread of COVID-19 has led to a dramatic shift in recruiting practices for college basketball coaches. Instead of crisscrossing the country to watch recruits play and hosting them for on-campus visits, coaches now have to get creative while in lockdown mode.  So do the recruits trying to get their attention.  The high-end recruits? They'll be fine. Coaches have been tracking most of them since middle school and already know what they can do.  The middle-of-the-road and borderline-Division I recruits still have something to prove. The pandemic prevents them from doing it in person, leaving game film or long-distance communication as the only options to make an impression.  “Those are the kids that are hurt the most because they don’t have an opportunity to break out and play in front of coaches. It’s tough for them,” said Ryan Silver, director and founder of the West Coast Elite Under Armour program. “The coaches can watch film, but want to see them live.”  Film tells one story, usually the most positive one, at least when it comes to highlight reels. Live is where the middle-to-lower-level recruits make their mark.  Playing in front of college coaches provides an opportunity to show off intangibles, like attitude, coachability, adaptability, basketball knowledge, whether a player might be molded into a particular system.  Sometimes all it takes is one play for a recruit on a smaller AAU team or one buried on the bench of a larger one to catch a coach's attention.  Those opportunities, at least for now, are gone.  “The no-brainers are still the no-brainers. Maybe their egos are hurt a little bit because they don’t have the ability to earn their way up five more spots on the (recruiting ratings) board or something,” PowerHouse Hoops coach John Ortega said. \"But this hurts the tweeners, for sure, the guys that are 6-3 and below, the very skilled players that need to show that, hey, I can guard better athletes or I can play this other position. Now they can't.\"  The summer shutdown will likely have lasting implications into the fall and beyond.  Players who were expecting to make college decisions during the early signing period in November now may wait to make a commitment as they weigh options and coaches sort out their rosters.  Like Murphy, Dexter Stratton has generated interest from plenty of college coaches, mostly across the West since he wants to be close to home where his family can watch him play.  The 6-7 forward from San Diego could have expanded his options with a good summer playing for his AAU team. Instead, the virus has forced him to stay home, attending daily Zoom meetings with West Coast Elite, working on ballhandling, lifting weights, running hills and getting shots up in his driveway.  The coaches may not be able to watch him play, but Stratton is keeping himself on their radar by continuing conversations and sending film — all while waiting to see how things shake out.  “It pushes things back a little bit,” Stratton said. “It makes it harder to have an idea at a time right now. But my goal is right about the start of my senior year for high school, maybe not be committed, but have a really good idea.”  No one's quite sure when basketball returns. Recruits hoping to earn scholarships are busy making sure they'll be ready when it does.

More than half also believe Trump is not following advice from public health experts enough.  Trump has made himself the daily spokesman for the nation’s coronavirus response, but new numbers suggest that Americans are taking his updates with a grain of salt.  Just 28 percent of Americans said they're regularly getting information from Trump about the coronavirus.  And only 23 percent said they have high levels of trust in what the president is telling the public. Another 21 percent trust him a moderate amount.  Confidence in Trump is higher among his supporters, though only about half of Republicans said they have a lot of trust in Trump's information on the pandemic - and 22 percent said they have little or no trust in what he said about the COVID-19 outbreak.  A new survey revealed just 28 percent of Americans trust President Donald Trump's (pictured) information about the coronavirus  But even as many Republicans question Trump's credibility during the pandemic, the overwhelming majority of them - 82 percent - said they still approve of how he's doing.  That's helped keep the president's overall approval rating steady at 42 percent, about where it's been for the past few months.  Lynn Sanchez of Jacksonville, Texas, is among those who backs Trump despite reservations about his credibility.  Pictured: A patient is wheeled into Mt. Sinai Stuyvesant Hospital in Manhattan Thursday, as a new state testing program suggests that as many as one in five New Yorkers could be positive for coronavirus antibodies  Sanchez, who identifies as a political independent, said she trusts 'only a little' of what the president said about the crisis, but believes he's 'doing the best he can.'  'He's contradicted his own health experts a couple of times. I believe he gets carried away and doesn't sit down and think things through,' said Sanchez, a 66-year-old retired truck stop manager.  The survey's findings underscore Trump's rock-solid backing from Republicans, who have been unwavering in their overall support throughout his presidency, despite reservations about his credibility and temperament.  If that support holds through the November election, Trump would still have a narrow - but feasible - path to victory.  The findings also raise questions about the value of Trump's daily briefings from the White House during the pandemic - televised events that often paint a sunny picture of the nation's pandemic response that runs counter to the experiences of many Americans in cities and states hard-hit by the fast-moving virus.  While the briefings are the White House's main vehicle for getting information to the public, they frequently devolve into forums for the president to berate journalists and critics of the administration.  Trump has personally led the briefings for weeks, with a regular cast of public health officials, Cabinet secretaries and Vice President Mike Pence also taking turns updating Americans on the administration's response to the health and economic crisis.  Many Americans said they wish Trump were listening to some of those experts more as he navigates the crisis.  More than half of Americans who surveyed said Trump doesn't listen to public health experts, like Dr. Anthony Fauci (left) and Dr. Deborah Birx (right), enough  Specifically, 60 percent think Trump is not listening to health experts enough.  The leading public health officials advising Trump, Drs. Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, have advocated for maintaining strict social distancing measures even as the president and some of his supporters agitate to begin reopening the economy.  The most recent incident happened Thursday after Trump revealed he didn't agree with Dr. Fauci comments about 'significantly' ramping up testing capacity.  'No I don't agree with him on that, no I think we're doing a great job on testing,' Trump said at Thursday's White House press briefing. 'If he said that, I don't agree with him.'  Trump (left) has publicly disagreed with advice given by Dr. Anthony Fauci (right) about the country's COVID-19 response  Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, did an interview that was part of a 'Time 100' program on Thursday and said the country still needed to 'significantly' increase COVID-19 testing.  'We need to significantly ramp up not only the numbers of tests, but the capacity to perform them, so that you don't have a situation where you have a test but it can't be done because there isn't a swab, or because there isn't extraction media, or not the right vial,' Fauci said in the livestreamed Q&A.  'I am not overly confident right now at all that we have what it takes to do that,' the doctor continued.  'We are doing better, and I think we are going to get there, but we are not there yet,' Fauci added.  Additionally, Trump has called for some states to 'liberate' themselves from stay-at-home orders and appeared to support anti-lockdown protests that popped up across the country.  The survey found the vast majority of Americans - 80 percent - continue to back orders requiring Americans to stay in their homes, and a majority doubt that it will be safe to ease restrictions soon.  There is no indication that Trump is ready to step away from the daily briefings. He regularly touts their television ratings, one of his favorite metrics for success.  And indeed, the briefings continue to be aired at length on major cable news channels each evening.  Still, this moment of national crisis, with more than 49,000 reported coronavirus deaths in the U.S. and millions of Americans losing their jobs, has done nothing to broaden the president's appeal.  It was reported that 4.4 million Americans filed new unemployment benefit claims last week, according to the latest Labor Department figures.  About one in six American workers have now lost their jobs since mid-March, by far the largest streak of US job losses on record  There were 4.4 million new claims for unemployment benefits filed last week, according to the latest Labor Department figures released on Thursday. It adds to the nearly 22 million people who applied for unemployment aid in the previous four weeks  It adds to the nearly 22 million people who applied for unemployment aid in the previous four weeks.  The COVID-19 outbreak has caused around one in six Americans to lose their jobs.  The latest jobless claim figures show the coronavirus - in just five weeks - has now wiped out all of the 22.4 million jobs created since the Great Recession ended in 2009. At least 8.7 million jobs were lost in that period in the late 2000s.  Just 11 percent of Democrat said they approve of Trump's job as president. And 84 percent of Democrats have little to no trust in information the president is providing about the pandemic.  'I don't believe a thing the man said,' said Goble Floyd, a 70-year-old retiree from Bonita Springs, Florida. 'And that's sad when so many lives are at stake.'  The pandemic has reshaped the landscape for Trump's reelection prospects in November, when he will face Democrat Joe Biden.  The virus's swift spread across the country has upended the strong economy the president hoped to run on.  It could also overhaul what qualities Americans are seeking from their commander in chief.  There are few metrics in which Trump rates well with the majority of Americans, with just 17 percent of Americans said Trump is highly disciplined.  In regards to empathy - often an important intangible in presidential elections - 24 percent said Trump cares about people like them.  Trump's highest-rated attribute is leadership. According to the survey, 32 percent of Americans said strong leader is a very good description of the president, along with 18 percent who said that describes him moderately well.  When it comes to the nation's response to the virus, Americans are more inclined to trust and seek guidance from their state and local leaders than the president.  About half of those surveyed said they regularly get information from state and local officials and about the same amount said they have a significant trust in that information.  And thus far, a majority of Americans - 63 percent - said they approve of how states are handling the outbreak, up slightly from three weeks ago.  The uncertainty surrounding Trump's coronavirus response comes as the president's administration repeatedly accused China of intentionally downplaying its official coronavirus count.  'The numbers seem to be a little on the light side, and I'm being nice when I say that, relative to what we have witnessed and what was reported,' Trump said in a briefing.  'But we discussed that, not so much the numbers, but what they did and we're in constant communication. I would say the biggest communication has been between myself and President Xi.  'As to whether or not their numbers are accurate... I'm not an accountant from China.'  The COVID-19 initially began in Wuhan, China, in late December last year.  Suspicions are also mounting over the virus's origin, with many growing skeptical of China's claims it came out of a Wuhan 'wet market' where wild animals are sold for human food  Trump later said China 'must have the most' coronavirus deaths, in comparison to the United States, because it had a 'tremendous problem.'  'We don't have the-most-in-the-world deaths. The most in the world has to be China,' he said.  'It's a massive country. It's gone through a tremendous problem with this, a tremendous problem. And they must have the most.'  A member of Trump's administration have also alleged that COVID-19 was created in a Wuhan-based laboratory.  American intelligence services have reportedly launched a full-scale investigation into the lab over claims that scientists there allowed the novel coronavirus to escape as part of a botched experiment, leading to a global pandemic.  China has denied speculation that the pathogen originated inside the Wuhan Institute of Virology lab, though US government agencies are now said to be piecing together a timeline of what authorities in Beijing knew so as to 'create an accurate picture of what happened'.

After supermarkets up and down the country saw huge queues and rushes for staple goods such as toilet roll and tinned food, Most Reverend Justin Welby tweeted: 'If you're still hoarding more food and supplies than you need, please, please stop.  'Please think of others - especially the most vulnerable, and those risking their health to look after us. Leave enough for everyone. We depend on each other.'  The Church of England's most senior bishop added: 'And to put it a bit more strongly for followers of Jesus - there is no Christian justification for hoarding more than you need.  'As John the Baptist said in the Gospel of Luke, \"Whoever has two coats must share with anyone who has none; and whoever has food must do likewise.''

The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has urged stockpiling shoppers to stop hoarding food amid the coronavirus panic, telling worshippers there is 'no Christian justification' for doing so  Most Rev Welby instead urged people to consider donating to food banks, which have seen increased pressure during the outbreak.  'If your cupboards are full, here's an idea - take a few items to your local foodbank, or ask if your neighbours need something,' he tweeted.  The Church is preparing to deliver its Sunday services online-only for the first time after banning mass worship to prevent the spread of the virus.  Rev Welby's plea came after furious Britons criticised selfish panic-buyers who have raided shelves and left those most in need without food and essential supplies.  As the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country reaches 3,983 with 177 deaths, and workers are confined to carrying out their duties from home, shops are still being stripped bare.  Last week saw a spike in shoppers stripping shelves bare, leaving many of Britain's elderly and key workers who work long hours having to go without while others piled groceries high.  Customers had complained of facing three-week waits for grocery deliveries from supermarkets - with online stores not showing availability until as late as April 9 at some supermarkets.  Archbishop Welby pleaded with shoppers in a series of tweets to stop hoarding food. He also warned Christians directly that there is 'no Christian justification for hoarding more than you need'  In an effort to battle panic-buying and a huge increase in demand as customers self-isolate, Lidl will recruit 2,500 workers on four-week contracts, and Aldi revealed a recruitment drive to hire 9,000 new workers, including 4,000 permanent jobs.  Asda says it will hire more than 5,000 temporary employees laid off due to Covid-19, working with 20 national companies to bring staff from industries including food and travel at risk of losing their jobs.  Marks and Spencer said it will reserve a 'special hour' for NHS and emergency workers along with vulnerable customers for the first hour of trading on specific days - and Tesco announced that from Sunday they would introduce a similar measure, allowing Health Service staff to select their shopping before checkouts open.  The Prime Minister has urged the public to stop 'mass buying', saying that there is 'no reason' shops should be empty and asking Britons to 'please be reasonable in your shopping and be considerate of others'.  Social media users have been heaping scorn on shoppers who are taking more than their fair share of precious groceries using the hashtag #stophoarding - calling on their countrymen to be considerate and take only what they need.  Footage of distraught critical care nurse Dawn Bilbrough, who was unable to buy basic foods following a 48-hour shift, showed her urging shoppers to stop stripping supermarket shelves amid the coronavirus pandemic - in a post that gained such support it sparked the #doitfordawn hashtag where Britons are urged to be considerate of healthcare workers and those in need while shopping.

Lidl has announced plans to recruit 2,500 workers on four-week contracts to help keep up with high demand in stores as customers continue clearing shelves over the coronavirus outbreak. The grocer said recruits can start immediately and will be paid at least £9.30 an hour, adding 'the new hires will be responsible for working together to keep the store clean, tidy and the shelves well stocked so that customers can get the products they need'. Asda has announced plans to hire more than 5,000 temporary employees laid off due to Covid-19, working with 20 national companies to bring staff from industries including food and travel at risk of losing their jobs. Chief executive Roger Burnley said: 'During these difficult times everyone has to work together to help people most affected by Covid-19 and Asda is pleased to play its part. 'That is why today we have committed to hiring more than 5,000 employees who have lost their jobs due to Covid-19 and have been left with deep concerns about their household budgets.' Advertisement  In her heartbreaking appeal, Ms Bilbrough, 51, from York, who had just completed a lengthy and exhausting shift, explained that she had visited her supermarket to pick up basic food items for the next two days when she was left having a 'little cry'.  After discovering there were no fruit and vegetables for her to sustain a healthy living amid the COVID-19 outbreak, the healthcare worker made a tearful plea to the public urging them to 'just stop it'.  Britons retweeted Ms Bilbrough's message using the hashtag #doitfordawn, urging shoppers to stop hoarding crucial groceries leaving others with little or nothing.  The nurse took to Facebook from the seat of her car to tell the nation: 'So I've just come out the supermarket. There's no fruit and veg and I had a little cry in there.'  'I'm a critical care nurse and I've just finished 48 hours of work and I just wanted to get some stuff in for the next 48 hours.  'There's no fruit, there's no vegetables and I just don't know how I'm supposed to stay healthy.  'Those people who are just stripping the shelves have basic foods you just need to stop it because it's people like me that are going to be looking after you when you are at your lowest and just stop it please!'  After sharing the emotional video, Ms Bilbrough was flooded with messages of support from concerned friends and loved ones, with some offering her some of their very own food items.  One person wrote: 'Oh Dawn, I'm so sorry to see you so upset. The job you are doing is so very important to so many people, and how unfair it is that this means you are last in line for the nutritious food you really need to stay healthy and keep doing that important job. Thinking of you and sending much love.xxx'  While another commented: 'Oh dear Dawn, heartbreaking to see you like this, I feel you, you are strong, and it is so important what you do....and many others...proud proud proud. I will share....'  Another user added: 'Sending you love and strength Dawn Bilbrough xx'  Elsewhere another person offered the nurse some of their own groceries, telling her: 'Dawn bless you, please don't cry! I'm in isolation but I have a bag of potatoes, carrots and a water melon you can have.  'I can leave them on my doorstep for you, double bagged! Be fine once, cleaned and boiled. Please don't cry.'  The emotionally-charged video comes as retailers stress there is plenty of food in the supply chain but shoppers need to act responsibly to ensure everyone can get what they need- particularly those who are the most vulnerable.  The shelves are empty as panic buying continues at the Tesco Holmbush store in Shoreham, earlier this week  Items that are now selling out, and subsequently being rationed, at supermarkets up and down the country, include long-life milk, cleaning fluids, toilet rolls and pasta  Piers Morgan calls out stores and sellers that are inflating prices as much four times including toilet roll for £14 Calls are flooding in on social media to name and shame stores that are inflating their prices so much that a four-pack of toilet roll is selling for up to £14 amid coronavirus panic buying. Piers Morgan tweeted two pictures from local shops showing the prices of toilet roll as £14.99 and £18.99. He tweeted the pictures alongside the caption: 'Been sent this by a friend up North, taken in a local store today. Calls are flooding in on social media to name and shame stores that are inflating their prices so much that a four-pack of toilet roll is selling for up to £14 amid coronavirus panic buying 'Just as we'll never forget the wonderful generosity and kindness of people who go the extra mile now, nor should we ever forgive essential shop-keepers who fleece their regular customers in a time of crisis.' Some Twitter users have speculated that they believe the store is a corner shop in Gainford, Darlington. Another outraged customer filmed the owners of his local newsagent which had hiked the price of a packet of toilet roll to £10. Footage shows a woman behind the counter at the newsagent on the phone to police claiming the customer is 'harassing' her. He proceeds to walk out of the shop and says, 'Do not come to this shop,' while pointing his camera at the storefront. James Deegan posted the footage on to his Twitter account alongside the caption: 'This is akin to the black market in WW2 and this should be made illegal. 'She's calling police, they should be arresting them for profiteering in a national emergency. 'There is no excuse for hiking prices like this absolute scumbags.' Other social media users took to Twitter to post pictures of their local shops profiteering from similar methods. The dramatic rise in prices comes as Boris Johnson yesterday spoke on the topic of mass buying. Horrified Twitter users responded to the astonishing uploads to show their disgust During the fourth press conference of its kind, created to keep the public up to date on coronavirus issues, Johnson said: 'I really hope retailers will continue to be reasonable. 'I don't want to see profiteering of any kind. 'We've got good supply chains and farms, theres no reason for shops to be empty. 'Everyone understands why people are buying stuff - we're being advised to stay at home if we have symptoms. 'However, please be reasonable in your shopping and be considerate of other shoppers as you do it.' Sajid Javid tweeted to say: 'Stop panic buying. I know many of you are tense and nervous. But it has real consequences for vulnerable people. 'Just think. And stop it.' Horrified Twitter users responded to the astonishing uploads to show their disgust. One said: 'Report to trading standards, profiteering is illegal.' While another said: 'This is a disgrace! How can these people live with themselves. Can we not name and shame these individuals? 'They need outing on TV.' Online retailers on eBay were also found to be hiking prices up and two rolls of toilet paper were seen selling for £9.99, alongside another brand of toilet paper which was selling four rolls for the same price. Advertisement  Supermarkets are taking measures to help shoppers during the coronavirus outbreak, particularly for the elderly and vulnerable.  As thousands of customers stockpiled on products in a panic-buying frenzy, many were left facing empty shelves at the supermarkets during their food shop.  Here are a range of actions taken by supermarkets to steer people away from stockpiling to ensure fewer people are missing out:  Tesco has prioritised a one-hour slot for the elderly and vulnerable every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 9am in all of its stores with the exception of Express stores.  NHS staff are also able to visit large stores one hour before the usual store opening time every Sunday from March 22.  Customers are only able to buy three items of the same product with the removal of multi-buy promotions.  To allow for cleaning and filling shelves with stock, Tesco reduced the opening times at its 24-hour stores to 6am to 10pm.  The supermarket has implemented some social-distancing measures at its checkouts with customers encouraged to pay by card.  Sainsbury's has dedicated the first hour in every supermarket to elderly and vulnerable customers.  The supermarket will also give customers aged over 70 and those with a disability priority access to online delivery slots from Monday.  It is also planning to expand its click and collect service by adding more collection sites from Monday.  To allow extra room for essential products, Sainsbury's closed all of its cafes and meat, fish and pizza counters in its stores.  Customers are limited to buying three of any product and a maximum of two of the most popular products including toilet paper, soap and long-life milk.  From Friday, Asda has dedicated the opening hours up until 9am in its larger stores for vulnerable people, with additional support for those who need it.  The supermarket has restricted shoppers to three items of any product including food, toiletries and cleaning products.  As staff numbers fluctuate with workers in self isolation, Asda revealed plans to recruit 5,000 people.  Its employees are being urged to invite friends and family whose work has been impacted by coronavirus to get in touch with their local store about job opportunities.  Waitrose, which is part of the John Lewis Partnership, has placed a three-item limit on certain products and a limit of two packets of toilet roll.  On Friday, it launched a protected shopping period for the elderly and vulnerable at every store which will take place during the first opening hour.  The retail group has also launched a £1 million community support fund to create additional delivery services, as well as delivering essential items to care homes and community groups and donating products to vulnerable people.  The high street chain announced it is dedicating the first hour on Tuesdays and Fridays for NHS staff and emergency workers.  This does not include franchise stores in petrol and railway stations.  On Friday the first opening hour of its stores were set aside for vulnerable customers, which will continue next week every Monday and Thursday.  The German discount supermarket has announced a recruitment drive to hire 9,000 new workers, including 4,000 permanent jobs, to help keep shelves filled during the coronavirus outbreak.  The supermarket added that all nappies and paper products, including toilet and kitchen roll, will now be restricted to two items per customer. All other products will remain restricted to four items per customer, with a few exceptions.  Morrisons announced on Tuesday it is creating 3,500 jobs to expand its home delivery service to cope with demand.  It has placed purchasing restrictions across 1,250 lines.  Morrisons also announced an expansion of its home delivery service, including 3,500 new jobs.  On Friday, Lidl announced plans to recruit 2,500 workers to start immediately on four-week contracts to cope with the surge in demand.  In Northern Ireland, there are dedicated shopping sessions for elderly people from 9am to 11am every day.  The Co-op announced it will create 5,000 jobs to provide temporary employment for hospitality workers who have lost their jobs because of the coronavirus crisis.  Around 6,500 students across 25 Co-op Academy Schools who currently have free school meals will be given a £20 voucher for every week that schools remain shut.  Since Thursday, the first hour of opening every day at all Iceland stores have been dedicated to the elderly and vulnerable.  Supermarkets are responding to increasing pressure to stock shelves and deliver orders on time with an urgent recruitment push to hire thousands including 9,000 at Aldi, and 5,000 at Asda.  Lidl announced plans to recruit 2,500 workers on four-week contracts to help keep up with high demand in stores as customers continue clearing shelves over the coronavirus outbreak.  The grocer said recruits can start immediately and will be paid at least £9.30 an hour, adding 'the new hires will be responsible for working together to keep the store clean, tidy and the shelves well stocked so that customers can get the products they need'.  Supermarket cleared of beer - except Corona! A Sainsbury's store was stripped of nearly all its beer - but wary customers left dozens of boxes of Corona. A picture of the shop in Dulwich shows shelves almost completely bereft of alcohol, but boxes of the Mexican beer remained nearly untouched. Last month the company that owns Corona was reported to have been facing its worst quarter in 10 years following the coronavirus outbreak. Advertisement  Asda's plans include hiring more than 5,000 temporary employees laid off due to Covid-19, working with 20 national companies to bring staff from industries including food and travel at risk of losing their jobs.  Chief executive Roger Burnley said: 'During these difficult times everyone has to work together to help people most affected by Covid-19 and Asda is pleased to play its part.  'That is why today we have committed to hiring more than 5,000 employees who have lost their jobs due to Covid-19 and have been left with deep concerns about their household budgets.'  Following the rise in panic buying, supermarket chains Tesco and Sainsbury's announced that they will be restricting customers to only buying three of any grocery item.  A Sainsbury's spokesperson told MailOnline they are limiting purchases of grocery products to a maximum of three of each item and a maximum of two on the most popular products including toilet paper, soap and UHT milk.  Meanwhile, while Asda and Morrisons announced they too will be restricting purchases across 1,250 regularly-bought lines.  Online retailer Ocado also temporarily stopped new customers from gaining a membership after they were left overwhelmed by orders from people choosing to self-isolate amid the crisis.  Yesterday Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged the country to stop panic buying and be 'reasonable' when they went to the supermarkets.  He said: 'We've got good supply chains and farms, there's no reason for shops to be empty.  'Everyone understands why people are buying stuff - we're being advised to stay at home if we have symptoms.  'However, please be reasonable in your shopping and be considerate of other shoppers as you do it.'

The wide-ranging initiative, dubbed “The Holy City,” features immersive experiences of the Holy Fire ceremony at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, the priestly blessing (“Birkat Kohanim”) at the Western Wall, and Ramadan prayers in Al-Aqsa Mosque compound.Eilat Lieber, director of the Tower of David Museum, told The Media Line that before the COVID-19 outbreak Jerusalem was expecting hundreds of thousands of Jewish, Christian and Muslim pilgrims to arrive in April. For the first time since 1992, Passover, Easter and Ramadan were all set to take place in the same month.But with the latest Israeli Health Ministry directives banning all foreign travelers and nonessential activities, the tourism industry has taken a massive hit and museums across the country have shut their doors.“At least we have the Holy City virtual tour of Jerusalem,” Lieber said. “Many people want to visit all over the world and they can’t.”The Holy City project was initially set to combine a VR tour with an interactive historical display and escape room inside the Tower of David Museum. Once visitors who were physically present would make their way to the end of the escape room, they would then get to experience the holy sites virtually.Museums all over the world are adopting VR technology in order to get their cultural content out to the world during the crisis, Lieber said.“This experience is talking about the city of three religions and it’s very balanced,” she asserted. “Here at the Tower of David, we believe that knowledge is power. If you know the other, we believe that you will be more tolerant and inclusive. This is the way to experience Jerusalem.”Holy City VR, the team behind the project, is a joint venture between Blimey, a Jerusalem-based company, and a Canada-based company named Occupied VR. They had to receive special permission from the religious authorities in order to produce the 360-degree videos at the Western Wall, Al-Aqsa Mosque compound and Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Also known as the Temple Mount, the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound is generally not accessible to the wider public due to it being a flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.“Each one of us approached the different institutions in Jerusalem and [made clear] that they are not going to be misrepresented by anyone,” Nimrod Shanit, executive director of Holy City VR and the owner of Blimey, explained to The Media Line. “It was a really interesting way to work, kind of like an interfaith project.”Even though the museum’s project can be viewed from home, Shanit noted that the full experience at the Tower of David Museum is significantly more interactive and that he hopes visitors would eventually get to see the real deal.With the coronavirus pandemic, VR and remote communication platforms are taking on an even greater added importance as a much-needed form of “escapism,” he said.“It’s a very interesting period,” Shanit affirmed. “There’s a kind of paradigm shift when it comes to a lot of things. A lot of platforms and virtual ways of communication were accessible earlier [but] might have been looked at as premium or exclusive.“Suddenly, they’ve become a thing where people can understand how they can be of value. This immersive medium really gives you that feeling of being somewhere else,” he said.Businesses, Education Sector Jump on Remote Communication BandwagonIt is not only the cultural sphere that is turning to creative technologies as a result of the coronavirus crisis.As a growing number of companies tell their employees to work from home, remote communication platforms are also reaping the benefits. Video-conferencing specialist Zoom has seen a jump of hundreds of percentage points in use, according to Tamar Zuk, the marketing manager of Naotech, the official representative of Zoom in Israel.“Up until around 2 weeks ago, the businesses that were using our services were those with more than 50 employees or hi-tech companies,” Zuk revealed to The Media Line. “Today we see that video conference solutions have become a necessity and not a luxury.”Zuk said that while this mode of holding meetings and communicating has essentially been forced on businesses because of the virus, she expects that it will soon become the norm thanks to its efficiency.“There are several benefits to holding meetings online versus having them in person, such as the ability to record them, the fact that you can review them and then send them to other people if needed,” she explained. “[Businesses] will understand that it is much more effective and better to work with online meetings.”In addition to businesses, schools are turning to virtual communication in order to continue to operate.Multinational firm Kaltura has set up a massive online platform for students from grades 7 to 12 in Israel in cooperation with the Israeli Education Ministry and online learning company Lnet.“We set up an operation that other companies take about six months to launch in less than a week,” Zohar Babin, executive vice president of platform and growth at Kaltura, told The Media Line. “This is our time to shine and really reinvent how education is done.”Kaltura has repackaged educational curriculum into 20-minute lessons that are being broadcast nationwide to roughly 700,000 students, according to Babin.“We’re trying to handle the crisis but it’s also at the same time a huge opportunity for the education space,” he said, adding that the educational sphere has long lagged behind other sectors in being open to adopting new technologies.The online classes Kaltura offers were designed in cooperation with pedagogical professionals and following each lesson students are invited to complete assignments. While the lessons themselves are centralized, with Kaltura and the Education Ministry providing standardized classes in all subjects, schools also have the option of creating their own virtual environments and tailoring assignments to suit their own needs.Babin believes the COVID-19 pandemic marks the beginning of a fundamental shift in learning.“We’re just getting started here,” he asserted. “We’re going to add interactive capabilities in the coming days [and] more social capabilities.”Aside from convenience factors, the environmental benefits of remote communication and work are a major added bonus. In fact, levels of air pollutants in several cities and regions around the world have seen a drastic drop since the coronavirus outbreak, with NASA and the European Space Agency recording a significant reduction in nitrogen dioxide emissions typically released by vehicles and industrial facilities.“We’ve gotten used to spending all that time traveling and trying to stay [physically present] with each person, whereas the biggest benefit with technology is that we can be in person with each other but not have to travel and not have to invest all that time in going from place to place,” Babin said. “It’s doing better for the world and for us. We can do a lot more in less time.”For more stories, go to themedialine.org  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 25, "positive": 51, "negative": 4, "sadness": 1, "joy": 10, "anger": 7, "fear": 7, "trust": 11}, "metadata": ["online", "coronavirus", "quarantine", "industries", "onslaught", "virtual", "distancing", "holy", "sites", "mosque", "media", "outbreak", "muslim", "pilgrims", "ministry", "travelers", "nonessential", "tourism", "initially", "significantly", "sector", "specialist", "solutions", "students", "cooperation", "nationwide", "crisis", "pandemic", "european"]}, {"text": "Schools across the United States are canceling trips abroad, preparing online lessons and even rethinking 'perfect attendance' awards as they brace for the possibility that the coronavirus could begin spreading in their communities.  Districts have been rushing to update emergency plans this week after federal officials warned that the virus, which started in China, is almost certain to begin spreading in the U.S.  Many are preparing for possible school closures that could stretch weeks or longer, even as they work to tamp down panic among students, parents and teachers.  There has only been one known school closure in the U.S. so far.

Officials said the school was being cleaned and disinfected 'out of an abundance of caution'.  The school remained closed on Friday after a staff member who returned home from international travel reported that their family member was sick. They were both placed in quarantine.  'After much consideration and information gathering from multiple sources, including our partners at Public Health Seattle & King County, I have decided to keep Bothell High School closed on Friday, Feb. 28. This will provide us an opportunity to complete the cleaning and hopefully receive the results of the test,' said Superintendent Michelle Reid, Northshore School District.  On Friday, Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney confirmed that the coronavirus was likely to cause school closures across the U.S.  Mulvaney sought to reassure concerned Americans advising people 'to turn their televisions off for 24 hours'.  'Are you going to see some schools shut down? Probably. Maybe see impacts on public transportation? Sure, but we do this. We know how to handle this,' he said at the Conservative Political Action Conference outside of Washington D.C.  School district officials decided to close the school for disinfecting on Thursday and Friday  A school janitor walks up stairs inside Bothell High School, closed after a staffer's family member was placed in quarantine for showing symptoms of possibly contracting the new virus  School closings have been widespread in China, Italy and Bahrain where the outbreak is more widespread, although evidence from China has suggested that children are more resilient to the virus than adults.  On Thursday, the virus prompted Japan's prime minister to ask all of the nation's schools to close for a month as officials work to control the spread of the new virus in the country.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stated that 'the government would put health and safety of children first and request; all elementary, junior- and senior-high schools and special needs education schools to close from March 2 to the spring break'.  It became the second country after China to shutter all its schools in an attempt to stop the outbreak.  On Friday, Iran also ordered all schools and universities to close until March 21, despite initially claiming the country's outbreak was exaggerated by enemy propaganda.  German health officials closed down schools in the North Rhine-Westphalia area after a man with no known connection to the illness tested positive.

Three of the new cases were found in Bahraini women who were returning from Iran through Bahrain International Airport.  The country suspended all private and public school, nurseries and universities for the next two weeks.  In Italy, authorities made the decision to reopen schools in areas that were less hard hit on Friday.  A tribunal in the east central region of Marche suspended a regional ordinance that had shut down schools and museums. In the western region of Liguria, which has reported about 20 cases, local administrators decided that students could resume school next week.  The United Kingdom's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty has warned that the country may need to prepare for school closures in the event of further outbreak.

The school closed on Thursday  President Donald Trump has worked to minimize fears about the virus, but on Wednesday he also recommended schools start planning for arrival of the COVID-19 virus 'just in case'.  'It's the perfect time for businesses, health care systems, universities and schools to look at their pandemic preparedness plans, dust them off, and make sure that they're ready,' Trump said Wednesday at a White House news conference.  School letters sent home from Florida to California this week sought to assure parents that, in most communities, the risk of exposure to the virus is still very low.  Most suggested the same precautions used to combat the flu: Wash hands frequently, cover sneezes and coughs, and stay home if fever or other symptoms arise.  At schools, cleaning crews have been told to pay extra attention to door knobs, keyboards and other surfaces that students touch through the day. Some districts have invested in handheld disinfectant sprayers that are used in hospitals, others are adding traditional hand sanitizers in schools and buses.  But even as they work on prevention, schools are also starting to prepare for the worst.  Many are making plans to teach students online in case the virus spreads so widely that schools are forced to close. Officials are considering how they would handle large numbers of absences among students or teachers, and how to make up days that could be missed because of the virus.  A staff member cleans a door at Bothell High School, Washington, which remained closed on Friday as a result of a potential coronavirus case in the family of one of its staffers  In Miami, public school leaders said they're readying 200,000 laptops and tablets for students in case buildings close and force classes online.  They're also directing new international students to register at two reception centers instead of at school buildings, where students have typically registered.  'If there is one place where a contagion can actually spread, it could be the schoolhouse,' Alberto Carvalho, superintendent of Miami-Dade County Public Schools, said at a Wednesday news conference.  'We are ready. We have protocols in place'.  The district is also among many halting or scaling back foreign travel over concerns about the virus.  Miami officials opted to cancel upcoming field trips to Italy and Scotland, while Virginia´s Fairfax County announced it's suspending all trips to countries where the virus has spread.  In Colorado, where state law requires schools to provide 160 days of instruction per year, education officials are promising flexibility. A Wednesday letter from the state's education department says it will support schools that 'experience a prolonged closure'.  Many districts say they're awaiting instruction from their state health departments and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dallas' public school district said it's 'reviewing and modifying crisis response plans should an outbreak occur'.  Public schools in San Francisco say they're preparing for exposure of the virus in the district but have 'no such cases at this time'.  Districts already have plans to deal with natural disasters, flu outbreaks and other emergencies, and many have planned for widespread infections before, most notably during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.  But most have never faced the prospect of closing for weeks at a time, as has happened in China and other countries working to prevent the virus from spreading.  Students leave campus at Bothell High School on February 27, 2020 in Bothell, Washington after the school was closed when a staffer's family member was placed into quarantine  Do not enter signs are seen taped to doors at Bothell High School on February 27, 2020  Some U.S. districts say they already have online learning systems that could be used to provide classes online, but not all schools have that technology.  Some have started preparing lessons that could be emailed to students instead or sent home in packets.  If schools are forced to close for long stretches, it could have a heavy impact on students who rely on school meals and for parents who use their schools' child care programs, said Francisco Negrón, chief legal officer for the National School Boards Association.  The group is urging school leaders to discuss those issues with local authorities and develop contingency plans.  The group is also asking districts to reconsider attendance awards that are sometimes given to students who don't miss a day of class for an entire year or semester. Some schools have previously abandoned the practice amid fears that it encourages students to come to school sick, but some still award gift cards, cash or raffle prizes to students with perfect attendance.  'School districts may want to revisit what it means to have perfect attendance,' Negrón said.  'We certainly wouldn't want sick kids to come to school just because their parents are shooting for that perfect attendance award'.  In many districts, nurses are being asked to serve as the front line in combating the virus. Officials at Denver Public Schools said nurses have been trained on guidelines for managing an outbreak and will be respond to any cases and report to health authorities.  A national association of school superintendents said it's pressing the CDC for more detailed guidance for schools as they confront the virus.  In the meantime, the American Association of School Administrators issued a letter on Thursday telling schools to use 'common sense strategies' focusing on prevention.  The letter urged districts to focus on personal hygiene, to develop procedures for reporting cases and to consider canceling trips to any areas in the U.S. or abroad where there have been outbreaks.  'The classroom is a wonderful breeding ground for viruses,' said Dan Domenech, executive director of the group.  'That's why we need to plan what we're going to do when we begin to see incidents of the coronavirus in our schools and in our communities'.  According to Amy Acton, director of Ohio's health department, the closing of schools may not be the best option in the case of a more widespread outbreak in the U.S., especially as children are proving more resilient than adults.  She told the New York Times that schools also had an important role to play in health education around the virus and the current preparation should focus on planning for the absence of staff members.  'Schools can be telling families what they can be doing to stay healthy, and we can teach about viruses, and what is a zoonotic disease? Why is it important to get a flu vaccine?' Acton said.  'This is a teachable moment'.

Zipkin of GoHealth Urgent Care says medics are being abused and insulted by 'hostile' patients  New York doctors working on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic are describing the shocking abuse they suffer from panicked patients, who insult and spit on medics as they race against time to treat the sick.  Dr J.D. Zipkin, the associate medical director of Northwell Health – GoHealth Urgent Care, revealed that the outbreak has sparked pandemonium in city hospitals with patients lashing out if they don’t get their way.  'We’ve had people trash our lobbies, cursing, spitting, coughing on the faces of my employees, if they don’t get what they want. We’ve had to ramp up security. It’s a whole deal,' Zipkin said to Reuters.  He says patients have become 'hostile to our front desk' and there have been incidences of people coughing in the faces of employees.  'We’ve had people trash our lobbies, cursing, spitting, coughing on the faces of my employees, if they don’t get what they want. We’ve had to ramp up security. It’s a whole deal,' Zipkin said  He says patients have become 'hostile to our front desk' and there have been incidences of people coughing in the faces of employees. GoHealth Urgent Care has three New York City locations  'I describe it in two ways, one, we’re drinking from the fire hydrant and the other way to describe it is, everything’s on fire and the fire extinguishers are also on fire,' Zipkin said on the chaos unfolding at GoHealth's three Manhattan locations.  The added stress and raucous behavior of patients is only adding to the pressure medics face as they grapple with shortages of medical supplies, manpower, and a mounting number of coronavirus cases.  In the US as of Tuesday there are over 180,000 cases of the virus and over 3,000 deaths.  New York, the undoubted epicenter of the crisis, has over 75,000 cases across the state and 1,500 deaths. More than 38,000 of those cases come from New York City where there has been a reported 914 deaths.  'I am personally the type of person who runs towards the fire to help. So yeah, these are absolutely grueling hours and I haven’t been this sleep-deprived in a long while, but there’s also a deep sense of purpose that kind of keeps me going,' Zipkin said.  'I’ve had a lot of my providers end their shifts in tears. It’s more than any of us signed up for,' he added.  'I think there’s a lot of emotional burden, that the families can’t be there with them, that people are dying relatively rapidly, especially this older age group,' Dr. Jennifer Haythe, a critical care cardiologist at Columbia University Medical Center (above), said  The influx of coronavirus cases doesn’t just effect patients and doctors, it effects the patient’s families as well as they are not allowed to visit their loved ones, and in some cases, say goodbye.  'I think there’s a lot of emotional burden, that the families can’t be there with them, that people are dying relatively rapidly, especially this older age group,' Dr. Jennifer Haythe, a critical care cardiologist at Columbia University Medical Center, said to the New York Post.  'For me personally, I find that I’m pretty … you know, I wake up, I’m on, I’m on all day and I’m off. And I find that when I feel more overwhelmed is either at night, now I’m alone without my family, or when I wake up in the morning and I realize like, this is reality.

The city sent out an expanded list of parking restrictions this week to urge non-residents to stay clear of the coastal town, which last week shut down parking lots at popular beach areas such as Salt Creek and Strand Beaches, Doheny State Beach and the Dana Point Harbor.  “We must all do our part to lessen the impact of this crisis.

No consensus exists on the future of relations between China and the West. Yet, clearly that is changing.  Previously, many looked at Beijing as little more than a “checkbook,” an opportunity to make a quick buck and buy cheap stuff. That is quickly becoming the minority view. Even those still anxious to continue to engage know we are heading into troubled waters.  Left unaddressed, the influence of China’s communist government will threaten the freedom, prosperity, and security of the transatlantic community. Only together can the U.S., Canada, and its European partners ensure a stable future that allows free nations to thrive.  >>> When can America reopen? The National Coronavirus Recovery Commission, a project of The Heritage Foundation, is gathering America’s top thinkers together to figure that out. Learn more here.  It is also not realistic to think the world will harden into new Cold War camps. We live in an interconnected world; a world of independent nations doing business around the clock; where the “freedom of the commons,” including the freedom to cross the seas and transit the skies, is a right.  That means the future is going to be messy. We can’t just wish China away.  To get through this, the family of free nations in the transatlantic community can’t be neutral in our approach to global affairs and China’s role. After all, we believe in popular sovereignty, human rights, and free enterprise. The Chinese Communist Party does not. If we do not stand together and defend these equities, we will lose the world we love.  Increasingly, leaders in Europe and the United States recognize that doing business as usual with China is risky business. So what do we do?  In part, the issue of China has come to the forefront because of the appalling behavior of the Chinese Communist Party in responding to the outbreak in Wuhan of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. No question, the Chinese government allowed people to travel internationally, knowing they had the potential to be highly contagious.  Further, China delayed reporting under international health regulations and did not provide live samples of the coronavirus to other countries for research and vaccine development. The regime’s behavior is not an aberration. China has a long history of bad behavior.  The global pandemic demonstrated the catastrophic consequences of leaving Beijing unchecked. Just as we need a vaccine to deal with COVID-19, we need a prophylaxis to deal with a belligerent, uncooperative Chinese Communist Party. Let’s get to it.  NATO is vital. The alliance needs to take the China threat seriously. Chinese actions and power could well erode NATO’s capacity to exercise self-defense.  From telecommunications to industrial control systems, from space and cyberspace to bridges, railroads, and ports, China already has a heavy footprint presence throughout the transatlantic community. NATO will need all this infrastructure to deter conflict and defend itself.  Yet if China controls the off switch or has the capacity to conduct malicious or denial activities, NATO’s capacity for self-defense will be severely compromised. NATO must be willing to prevent China from having the capacity to interfere in the defense of the alliance’s area of responsibility.  NATO nations all must continue to demonstrate the capacity for self-defense against other external threats.  The U.S. is a global power with global interests and responsibilities; in addition to participating in protecting the transatlantic community, the U.S. must face China in the Indo-Pacific and achieve a stable Middle East. For the U.S. to do all three well, NATO must do its part—particularly in dealing with the great external threats to European security.  NATO’s top priority must be countering the destabilizing activities of Russia. The second major threat is that the problems of the Middle East may spill over into and destabilize Europe. To confront all those very real possibilities, NATO needs to have the capacity and capability to look and act south toward the Middle East.  In short, a strong NATO allows the U.S. to focus more on responding to the global China challenge.  The European Union has a role. In addressing the destabilizing China threat to Europe, the EU is America’s other indispensable partner.  European leaders have seen in the past how China has used its relationships with individual European states to divide and conquer, play one country off against another, and undermine European solidarity to act in its own self-interest.  Further, the EU manages many of the competencies required to restrain Chinese predatory behavior, particularly in the areas of trade, finance, and investment.  Another area where EU-U.S. cooperation is vital is in taking on the challenges in Africa. Some African nations face a diversity of challenges, from human rights and lack of economic freedom to terrorism and environmental and public health issues, complicated by poor governance and public safety.  China’s incursions into Africa have served only to exacerbate all these problems. The Chinese have enabled corruption, employed predatory lending practices, and spread disinformation. The EU could be a partner for tackling many of these challenges together.  International organizations. Joint U.S.-European efforts to bring greater transparency and accountability in international organizations is also important.  For years, the Chinese Communist Party aggressively has attempted to inject staff and leaders into international organizations who are beholden to the Beijing regime. The World Health Organization is an ice shaving on the tip of the iceberg. The U.S. needs partners to tackle this threat.  U.S.-Europe economic recovery. The U.S. and Europe can’t handle China if our economies are not strong and resilient. The economic recovery of the transatlantic community is intertwined.  We need a joint U.S.-European economic recovery program. This program would not consist of traditional foreign aid but instead rely on investment and partnership engaging the private sector.  The United States and Europe need each other more than ever. It is time for leaders on both sides of the Atlantic to invest in strengthening the world’s most important partnership.

However, the advantage of soap is when combined with water it can cover large surface area. The preference is consequently always to be using soap and water where possible. If not, then alcohol gel with a good technique will also work. Always exhibit caution when washing phones with alcohol-based solution.

Early research from Pfizer identified a drug candidate earlier this month that could keep the novel coronavirus from replicating.  The company hopes to start testing on humans this summer to prove the early findings that the experimental drug could slow or stop the spread of the virus in patients.  Pfizer is also working with BioNTech on developing a vaccine based on messenger RNA technology. The company has invested $185 million upfront and can boost its total investment to nearly $750 million.

Some restaurant managers say they could be facing a 50 percent loss in business, several are telling some servers to stay home.  “We’ve pretty much cut our staffing in half since this started,” said Dave Flowers, who is the General Manager of Johnny’s Downtown.  One of the biggest concerns for some restaurant managers is they are only at the start of a downward sales trend.  “We’re real big backers of the Cleveland independent film festival and when that happened, the cancellation, they canceled the after hours they were having here,” said Flowers.  At Chicago’s Home of Chicken and Waffles, nearby Mac Basketball Tournament balloons were still on display Friday afternoon.  “We were set up to sponsor a lot of event for the MAC Tournament,” said Assistant Manager James Bledsoe. “Also we’ve had a lot of high end, large hotel catering orders which were canceled because unfortunately they had to cancel their trips.”  Mitchell’s Ice Cream announced the closing of dining rooms, instead offering ice cream to go and encouraging customers to pay with debit or credit cards so employees do not have to handle as much cash. They’ve also added one person at each location from open to close to focus on cleaning and sanitizing surfaces.  Outside of Cleveland, there is a similar concern about protecting shoppers while still supporting small businesses in Amherst.  “It will put our small businesses out of business and restaurants that is my fear,” said Teresa Gilles, the Executive Director of Main Street Amherst. “If they can’t come down because they’re worried I am sure that every business in Amherst would be more than happy to deliver.”  Inside the Mermaid’s Tale, owner Judy Recknagel is working to innovate and trying a proactive approach to entice shoppers to support her longstanding small business.  “On Monday business just shut off period and I knew something was different,” she said. “I knew what it was and then I knew I had to do something about it.”  Recknagel is turning to social media uploading daily videos of jewelry and other products in store, encouraging customers who are concerned about shopping in person to call in their orders.  She is offering in person at home delivery within a half hour radius. Shoppers can also call ahead for a pull up pick up service and get their order handed to them without leaving the car. All in an effort to keep money flowing and doors open amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  “It’s working, it’s baby steps, it’s not going to change overnight but at least people are coming in they’re calling,” said Recknagel. “We’re getting some business because small business like us I’ve been here 28 years, I’ve never seen anything like this we can’t sustain we have to be proactive.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 13, "positive": 17, "negative": 6, "joy": 1, "anger": 2, "fear": 3, "trust": 2}, "metadata": ["canceled", "hotel", "restaurants", "media"]}, {"text": "Our commenting has been temporarily disabled.

COVID-19 patients who are getting an experimental treatment from a drug called remdesivir have been recovering quickly, with most going home in days, STAT News reported Thursday after it obtained a video of a conversation about the trial.  The patients taking part in a clinical trial of the drug have all had severe respiratory symptoms and fever, but were able to leave the hospital after less than a week of treatment, STAT quoted the doctor leading the trial as saying.  “The best news is that most of our patients have already been discharged, which is great. We’ve only had two patients perish,” Dr. Kathleen Mullane, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Chicago who is leading the clinical trial, said in the video.  Mullane did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN.  The University of Chicago said Mullane’s comments constituted partial information.  “Partial data from an ongoing clinical trial is by definition incomplete and should never be used to draw conclusions about the safety or efficacy of a potential treatment that is under investigation,” it said in a statement.  “In this case, information from an internal forum for research colleagues concerning work in progress was released without authorization. Drawing any conclusions at this point is premature and scientifically unsound.”  There is no approved therapy for the Covid-19, which can cause severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome in some patients. But the National Institutes of Health is organizing trials of several drugs and other treatments, among them remdesivir.  The drug, made by Gilead Sciences, was tested against Ebola with little success, but multiple studies in animals showed the drug could both prevent and treat coronaviruses related to Covid-19, including SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome).  Back in February, the World Health Organization said remdesivir showed potential against Covid-19.  STAT said it obtained and viewed a copy of the video discussion Mullane had last week with colleagues about the trial.  “Most of our patients are severe and most of them are leaving at six days, so that tells us duration of therapy doesn’t have to be 10 days,” she was quoted as saying.  However, the trial does not include what’s known as a control group, so it will be difficult to say whether the drug is truly helping patients recover better. With a control arm, some patients do not receive the drug being tested so that doctors can determine whether it’s the drug that is really affecting their condition.  Trials of the drug are ongoing at dozens of other clinical centers, as well. Gilead is sponsoring tests of the drug in 2,400 patients with severe Covid-19 symptoms in 152 trial sites around the world. It’s also testing the drug in 1,600 patients with moderate symptoms at 169 hospitals and clinics around the world.  Gilead said it expected results from the trial by the end of the month.  “We understand the urgent need for a COVID-19 treatment and the resulting interest in data on our investigational antiviral drug remdesivir,” the company said in a statement to CNN. But it said a few stories about patients are just that — stories.  “The totality of the data need to be analyzed in order to draw any conclusions from the trial. Anecdotal reports, while encouraging, do not provide the statistical power necessary to determine the safety and efficacy profile of remdesivir as a treatment for Covid-19,” Gilead said.

The country's health agency said another 637 people tested positive for the virus, which raises the country's total to 3,631 since testing began in late February.  Patients requiring hospitalization also rose by 193 patients, health agency RIVM said. To date, 836 coronavirus patients were admitted to the hospital since testing started.  The dead are included in the ever-increasing number of total patients, and their ages ranged from 63 to at least 95. \"Most deceased people are between 80 and 84 years old,\" the RIVM noted.  Testing in the Netherlands is limited in comparison to other countries, with the Dutch health officials carrying out a maximum of a thousand tests per day. Because of that, the country prioritizes testing of healthcare workers, the elderly, and people whose health is more vulnerable to disease.  \"It means that the number of infections with the new coronavirus is higher than the number mentioned here,\" the RIVM said in a statement.  The percentage of cases in Noord-Brabant continued to decline in comparison to the other 11 provinces which saw more extreme increases in the rate of infection over the past eight days. Noord-Brabant was home to about 45 percent of people who tested positive on March 13, but that fell to just over 33 percent on Friday.  By Saturday, some 1180 of the province's residents had tested positive in total, an increase of 168. They now account for 32 percent of all cases in the Netherlands.  There were 81 more infections found in Zuid-Holland (486), 108 more in Noord-Holland (353), and 65 more in Limburg (418). Even with the disease's spread, RIVM director Jaap van Dissel said in an interview with Nu.nl on Saturday that his team expected another surge in cases in Noord-Brabant and the southern region of Limburg.  The coronavirus had the Netherlands in its grips this past week, with infections first topping 1,000 on Sunday and then nearly tripling to 2,994 by Friday. The government implemented stricter measures, closing schools, businesses and restaurants, except for deliveries and takeaways, and instructing everyone to stay 1.5 meters away from each other. The Netherlands also closed its borders to non-EU residents who do not absolutely need to be here, most court cases and parliamentary debates were postponed, asylum procedures were halted, and nursing homes were ordered on lockdown.  Both Prime Minister Mark Rutte and King Willem-Alexander addressed the nation this week - a rare move in both cases. King Willem-Alexander on Friday night also spoke with hope and conviction for the future of the Netherlands where, \"In the space of just a few weeks, our daily lives have changed drastically,\" he said.  The King heaped praise on all in the country working tirelessly to keep Dutch society functioning, and concern for those who feel scared or isolated. For the latter, he encouraged people to think creatively and look for ways they can help people overcome their sense of helplessness or loneliness, which he said would be critical in getting past this ongoing crisis.  Rutte explained the Netherlands' social-distancing approach to the Covid-19 outbreak. Residents are instructed to self-isolate as much as possible so that hospitals don't get overrun, but not completely so that some herd immunity can be built in the population.  RIVM director Jaap van Dissel later explained that herd immunity is not the government's end goal, but merely a stalling tactic while we wait for a vaccine. He also said that around 60 percent of the population must have had and recovered from Covid-19 for herd immunity to be achieved.  Van Dissel also opened the door this week to the possibility of more severe restrictions on the Dutch public, which could include a total lockdown of the country. \"I repeat again: whether more measures will be added now depends mainly on people's behavior. And yes, sometimes it is difficult, but then you have to choose the safe choice, for you and others,\" he said.  However he also noted that a stricter approach does not mean the virus disappears. It could instead kick the can down the road, delaying a sudden increase in infections instead of spreading out the infections over a longer period of time.  That the coronavirus has everyone in healthcare working over hours could be seen in Minister Bruno Bruins for Medical Care, who had been responsible for the Covid-19 approach since the start. He collapsed from exhaustion during a parliamentary debate on Wednesday evening. And on Thursday he announced his resignation. In a statement, Bruins said he was no longer physically up to the task. He compared combating coronavirus to the highest level of professional sports. \"And I have concluded that my body can no longer handle this due to exhaustion,\" he said. His fellow politicians complimented his hard work and wished him a speedy recovery.  Martin van Rijn from opposition party PvdA was appointed Bruins' successor on Friday.   https://www.instagram.com/p/B98xgyAhkbV/  The increasing restrictions to try and curb the spread of this virus worldwide, left many thousands of Dutch tourists stranded abroad. A large part of those who were traveling through a travel agency, have since been brought back to the Netherlands, Frank Oostdam, director of travel agencies' association ANVR, said to NOS. Of the estimated 200 thousand Dutch stuck abroad, between 20 thousand and 25 thousand traveled through an agency. By Friday afternoon, between 14 thousand and 19 thousand had been brought back to the Netherlands. Most of the rest will be repatriated next wee.  Oostdam called this an \"enormous achievement\" by the travel agencies. \"We all went the extra mile and worked incredibly hard to get this done. So everyone can come home,\" he said.

Meanwhile, the White House began checking the temperature of anyone coming into close contact with the president and other officials.  Prior to his testing, Trump said his personal physician told him he didn't show symptoms and didn't need to take the test. But Trump decided to do it anyway after repeated questions from reporters about why he was hesitating to undergo screening when he had been exposed to at least three people who have tested positive for the virus.  The White House released the test results just hours after Trump told reporters that he had been tested and that his temperature was 'totally normal.' He was recently in contact with three people at his Florida resort who have tested positive for the virus, including two aides to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.  'One week after having dinner with the Brazilian delegation in Mar-a-Lago, the President remains symptom-free,' Sean Conley, the president's physician, said in a memo.  Multiple lawmakers and countless citizens across the country who have had the same degree of exposure have not only tried to get tested, but also chosen to quarantine themselves as a precaution and to avoid potentially infecting others.  The pandemic has now infected more than 2,200 people in the U.S. and caused at least 50 deaths.  The president, according to two people close to the White House, had been reluctant to take the test for fear it would project weakness or worry. Trump wanted to appear in full control during the crisis, and had expressed concerns that taking personal steps could undermine that appearance.  But as the White House grappled with repeated exposures by Trump and multiple senior aides, it tightened precautions. On Saturday, the White House announced that it was conducting temperature checks on anyone who was in close contact with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, including reporters who attended the White House briefing Saturday and anyone entering the Oval Office.  To that end, a representative from the White House physician's office took the temperature of members of the media at the briefing, going around and putting a device to their heads. One reporter with a suspected elevated temperature was not allowed in.  Pence wrote a memo to White House staff Saturday reminding them to take precautions such as avoiding physical contact, washing hands frequently and staying home when sick to help the administration keep the virus at bay.  'It's imperative each one of us do our part to take the proper precautions to keep ourselves and our colleagues safe,' Pence wrote. 'As an employee aboard the White House Complex, we have an additional duty to protect the health of our Executive Branch and those working with us.'  Trump, 73, is considered to be at higher risk of complications from the disease because of his age. He has long tried to minimize the threat posed by the virus and continued to engage in behaviors that health officials are warning the public against.  On Friday, Trump shook the hands of multiple officials at his Rose Garden news conference and he has continued to appear at large gatherings despite tweeting Saturday morning that Americans should be practicing 'SOCIAL DISTANCING!'  \"It almost becomes a habit,\" Trump said when asked why he continues to shake hands contrary to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.  'People come up to me, they shake hands, they put their hand out, it's sort of a natural reflex,\" he said. 'We're all getting out of it. All of us have that problem.' He added: 'Shaking hands is not a great thing to be doing right now, I agree.'  The Brazilian Embassy in Washington said late Friday that the country's chargé d'affaires, Nestor Forster, tested positive after sitting at Trump's dinner table. So, too, did a top aide to Bolsonaro, who took a photo with Trump and attended a party with him, and another person who attended a campaign fundraiser with the president that Sunday, according to two Republican officials who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss private health matters.  Republican chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, who earlier this month traveled to a campaign rally with Trump on Air Force One, awaited her own test results after experiencing a fever and flu-like symptoms. She and her family were quarantining at home, the RNC said Saturday.  Several top administration officials, including Attorney General William Barr and Trump's daughter and senior adviser, Ivanka Trump, met last week with an Australian Cabinet minister who on Friday was confirmed positive.  A handful of White House staffers were tested for the virus after exhibiting flu-like symptoms, but all tested negative, according to a senior White House official. Flu activity in the country is currently high.  The White House has been saying, citing CDC guidelines, that the president and other White House officials don't need to be tested or isolate themselves unless they are exhibiting symptoms, even though that advice is contradicted by many health professionals who note that the virus can be spread even by people who are asymptomatic.  The reporter who was not allowed into the White House briefing Saturday had a temperature above the 100.4-degree guidelines in three checks over 15 minutes, tweeted Pence's spokeswoman, Katie Miller, citing the White House Medical Unit.  Public health officials say that people with a cough and elevated temperatures of 100.4 degrees or higher are deemed concerning.  Dr. Deborah Birx, who is helping coordinate the U.S. response to the outbreak, noted that testing results reflect a snapshot in time and that it's crucial for people to maintain precautions.  'When you get a negative test, that means you're negative that day,' Birx said. 'That doesn't mean that you couldn't get the virus spreading overnight, because it replicates in your nose and your nasal secretions, and you would have a positive test tomorrow.'   ___  Bev Banks contributed to this report.   ___  The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

The EUA process enables FDA to consider and authorize the use of unapproved, but potentially life-saving medical or diagnostic products during a public health emergency. The U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services declared the SARS-CoV-2 virus a U.S. public health emergency on Friday, January 31, 2020. FDA issued the EUA on February 4, 2020. IRR began distribution of the test kits to states, but shortly thereafter performance issues were identified related to a problem in the manufacturing of one of the reagents which led to laboratories not being able to verify the test performance.

Naturally, this is for entertainment purposes only and should not be taken with the belief the cocktail can protect you from COVID-19.  \"I haven’t written a drink specifically for COVID-19, but I have been helping a lot of folks make their own signature cocktails based on the contents of their liquor cabinet and pantry,\" Cronin said.  Learn to make the Four Thieves Vinegar below:  As for how he's coping with social distancing and, given his occupation, a lack of socializing, Cronin said he's fine, but he does worry about those business owners whose shops have had to close.  \"I’m coping about as well as anyone can when faced with a government shut down of their industry,\" he said. \"I’m afraid for all the local small business owners and their staff.

Officials at the agency have said they are concerned about a shortage of intensive care resources, including beds, ventilators and workers.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will begin construction at the Colorado Convention Center in Denver and The Ranch — Larimer County Fairgrounds in Loveland on Friday so that they can be used to care for patients who no longer require critical care.  Construction on both makeshift hospitals, which will be able to care for more than 3,000 patients between them, is expected to finish later this month, according to a news release.  “These will have resources and staff capable of caring for patients who are recovering from COVID-19,” the Department of Public Health and Environment tweeted.  The state health department also has signed letters of intent to use three former medical facilities across the state in order to provide a higher level of care than the convention center or fairgrounds. These facilities include St. Anthony North in Westminster, St. Mary-Corwin Medical Center in Pueblo and Western Slope Memory Care in Grand Junction.

( NIAID-RML via AP )  Projected covid-19 deaths in Arkansas have fallen sharply in recent days, according to a model that has been cited by members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.  State officials say the latest estimates are helpful, but they emphasized that much remains unknown.  \"We just don't have enough experience with this virus to say confidently that we know exactly what's going to happen one month, two months, three months from now,\" state Health Secretary Dr. Nate Smith said.  The new fatality projections from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation are still high. The coronavirus is projected to take 297 lives in Arkansas by Aug. 4.  Nonetheless, the number of projected deaths is dropping as Arkansans socially isolate and take other precautions, raising hopes that hundreds of lives will be spared.  The University of Washington research has been referenced repeatedly in recent days by Dr. Deborah Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force.  [CORONAVIRUS: Click here for our complete coverage » arkansasonline.com/coronavirus]  Its model, which is periodically revised, has helped to shape the federal response, she has said.  Birx and others have pushed for sweeping restrictions in recent weeks, saying inaction would lead to disaster.  \"All of the flu models predicted anywhere between 1.6 and 2.2 million fatalities, if we didn't mitigate,\" she told reporters at a White House briefing last month.  In a research paper published March 26, the institute had projected the coronavirus would kill 707 Arkansans by early August. An updated analysis, released Thursday, projected 619 deaths.  The latest figures, which were posted early Monday morning at covid19.healthdata.org/projections, anticipate a far lower toll.  Even so, the virus is expected to kill nearly one out of every 10,000 Arkansans.  Nationwide, the institute projects 81,766 deaths by Aug. 4 and foresees a possible shortage of health care resources by the middle of this month. That's down from 93,531 deaths in the projections released Thursday.  Unless new spaces are created, it foresees a shortage of 36,654 hospital beds and 16,323 intensive care unit beds on April 15. It projects the national daily death toll will peak April 16 at 3,130.  In Arkansas, daily deaths are expected to peak at 10 on April 27. The state has enough hospital and intensive care unit beds as well as ventilators to handle the worst of the outbreak, if the institute projections are correct.  At Monday's coronavirus media briefing, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said the decisions Arkansans make this month will have life-altering consequences.  \"If they continue to do what they're supposed to be doing, what we've asked them to do, what our directives say and social distancing and if that doesn't work, wear masks, reducing the size of gatherings, we're going to continue to flatten that curve,\" Hutchinson said.  State officials aren't ruling out further steps.  \"Let me emphasize, if we are not successful there and the spread accelerates, then Dr. Smith will be looking at additional measures to recommend,\" Hutchinson said. \"Our options are open in the future, but we're hopeful.\"  While the University of Washington modeling is attracting national attention, it is not the final word, he suggested.  \"There's probably 20 different projections out there for Arkansas,\" Hutchinson said. \"Today, because of our success, they changed the model.\"  The research will continue evolving as additional data is processed, he noted.  \"It's a changing environment out there, which just reflects we actually don't know completely how this develops, but I'm grateful for those projections. And whenever they give us a projection, we want to beat that projection and reduce that spread,\" he said.  Smith cautioned that some areas have seen spikes in transmission after seemingly slowing the rate of growth.  Coronavirus data can help Arkansas prepare for what's ahead, he said.  \"We need to use the information that we ... have available to plan wisely so that the things that we do today will improve our situation a month or two from now,\" Smith said.

Almost three in 10 (27%) Americans with rent or mortgage obligations aren’t confident they would be able to pay for housing, while 24 percent of those with credit card payments don’t believe they could pay those bills.  About one-third (34%) of those with other debts - like a personal loan - have low confidence that they would be able to pay down these debts in the event of a recession.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, Millennials are less confident in their ability to pay some of their bills in the event of a recession.  One in three (33%) Millennials with a rent or mortgage payment isn’t sure they could manage this expense if there was a recession, while fewer members of Gen X (27%) and Baby Boomer (24%) generations express the same uncertainty. Similarly, 34 percent of Millennials are not confident they could pay their credit card bills during a recession; while only 24 percent of Gen X and 19 percent of Baby Boomers say the same.  Additional data from this survey finds that just over four in 10 (41%) US adults say they are not very or not at all prepared for a recession. But slightly more (47%) say that they are prepared for a recession.  See full results from this survey here.

American Airlines and Delta Air Lines suspended all flights between New York and Milan. U.S. citizens going to Germany, Poland and other European countries, at alert level 2, must “take increased precautions.”  However, one category of U.S. citizens is exempted from these rules: the 20,000 soldiers beginning to arrive from the United States in European ports and airports for the Defender Europe 20 exercise, the largest U.S. troop deployment in Europe in the last 25 years. Including those already present, about 30,000 U.S. troops will participate in April and May, flanked by 7,000 troops from 17 NATO member and partner countries, including Italy.  The first armored unit arrived from the port of Savannah, Ga., to that of Bremerhaven in Germany. Altogether 20,000 pieces of military equipment arrived from the USA in six European ports (in Belgium, Holland, Germany, Latvia, Estonia). Another 13,000 pieces are supplied by the U.S. Army in Europe from prepositioned depots, mainly in Germany, Holland and Belgium. These operations, reports the U.S. Army in Europe, “require the participation of tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians from many nations.”  At the same time, the bulk of the contingent of 20,000 soldiers arrives from the U.S. in seven European airports. Among these are 6,000 National Guard coming from 15 states: Arizona, Florida, Montana, New York, Virginia and others.  At the beginning of the exercise in April, reports the U.S. Army in Europe, the 30,000 U.S. soldiers “will spread through the European region” to “protect Europe from any potential threat,” with clear reference to the “Russian threat.”  Gen. Tod Wolters — who commands the United States forces in Europe and at the same time those of NATO as Allied Supreme Commander in Europe — assures everyone that “the European Union, NATO and the European Command of the United States have worked together to improve the infrastructure.” This will allow military convoys to move quickly along 2,500 miles of transit routes.  Tens of thousands of soldiers will cross borders to conduct exercises in 10 countries. In Poland, 16,000 U.S. soldiers will arrive in 12 training areas with about 2,500 vehicles. U.S. paratroopers of the 173rd Brigade stationed in Veneto and Italians in the Lightning Brigade stationed in Tuscany will go to Latvia for a joint launch exercise.  Defender Europe 20 is being conducted to “increase the ability to rapidly deploy a large combat force from the United States to Europe.” It is therefore carried out with timescales and procedures that make it virtually impossible to subject tens of thousands of soldiers to COVID-19 health regulations and prevent them from coming into contact with the inhabitants during rest periods.  In addition, the U.S. Army in the Europe Rock Band will hold a series of free concerts in Germany, Poland and Lithuania that will attract large audiences.  The 30,000 U.S. soldiers, who “will spread through the European region,” are in fact exempted from the preventive COVID-19 regulations that apply to civilians. The assurance given by the U.S. Army in Europe that “we are monitoring the Coronavirus [COVID-19]” and that “our forces are in good health” is enough.  At the same time, the environmental impact of a military exercise of this magnitude is ignored. U.S. Abrams tanks will participate, weighing 70 tons, with depleted uranium shells. Each tank consumes 400 liters of fuel per 100 km, producing heavy pollution to deliver maximum power.  In this situation, what are EU and national authorities doing, what is the World Health Organization doing?

For more recent data, go to our new post on this topic.  Updated May 7, 5:36 p.m. ET: This story was originally published on April 28. We've updated it throughout to reflect updates and new data from several states.  In late April, NPR surveyed all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia to ask them about their contact tracing workforce. That survey showed that states had, or planned to have, around 36,000 workers in total focused on contact tracing, a key strategy to contain the spread of the coronavirus and prevent outbreaks.  In ten days since NPR first published the results of this survey, we've received responses from several more states; in addition some states with big populations announced new plans to increase contact tracing.  In all, 44 states and the District of Columbia now have plans to expand their contact tracing workforce, reaching a total of 66,197 workers — an increase by 30,000 of the number that were planned last week when we first published.  Public health leaders widely agree that communities need to ramp up their capacity to test, trace and isolate, in order to safely ease up on social distancing measures and allow people to get back to work.  The idea behind this public health strategy is simple: Keep the virus in check by having teams of public health workers — epidemiologists, nurses, trained citizens — identify each new positive case, track down their contacts and help both the sick person and those who were exposed isolate themselves.  This is the strategy that's been proven to work in other countries, including China, South Korea, and Germany. For it to work in the U.S., states and local communities will need ample testing and they'll need to expand their public health workforce. By a lot.  An influential group of former government officials released a letter last week calling for a contact tracing workforce of 180,000 around the country. Other estimates of how many contact tracers are needed range from 100,000 to 300,000.  Of 44 states and the District of Columbia for which we now have data, states reported having at least 11,142 contact tracers working now. (Figures for most states originally surveyed have not been updated so the total number may be higher.) But states seem to be moving fast to increase staffing.  Among the recent updates to states plans, California announced a partnership with UCSF to put 3,000 people a week through its 20-hour contact tracing training, with a goal of ultimately having 20,000 contact tracers. New York state also announced a plan to hire as many as 17,000 workers, in partnership with Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and the nonprofit Resolve To Save Lives.  The raw numbers each state needs varies by population size, the number of positive cases, and whether measures like social distancing have effectively limited the contacts for each case, says Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who leads Resolve To Save Lives.  According to the National Association of County and City Health Officials, which recently issued a position statement on contact tracing, 15 health workers per 100,000 people is a baseline number during normal times, and during a pandemic, this number should double to 30 contact tracers per 100,000 people. Policymakers in several states including New York and Illinois have mentioned this benchmark in announcing their staffing goals.  Still, the calculus for how many tracers are needed may not be as simple as looking at population size — the size of a community's outbreak and the number of contacts per case would also influence the number of contact tracers needed. Melaney Arnold, a spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Public Health, noted in her response to NPR that the hiring decisions are complicated and that the speed with which positive COVID-19 cases can be tested and isolated affect their projected staffing numbers.  Several contact tracer workforce worksheets are now available to policymakers: One calculator was unveiled Thursday from two public health heavyweights — the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials and National Association of County and City Health Officials — and the Mullan Institute at the George Washington University. And another calculator is published by Resolve to Save Lives.  Big hiring efforts, but not everywhere  Several states that took our survey are making big efforts to shore up their contact tracing workforces. Notable examples include Louisiana and Kentucky, which are both planning to hire 700 people; Texas, which has 1,150 contact tracers and is hiring another 2,850 to start; and Kansas, which plans to bring on 400.  \"I am really happy to see that there are a lot of places here that are thinking this through, and really putting a lot of effort into that next step,\" says Crystal Watson, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and a lead author of the center's white paper on contact tracing capacity.  Of the places that responded to NPR or have released this information in press releases, eight are positioned to surpass that 30 workers per 100,000 threshold: Alaska, California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Michigan, Nebraska, New York and North Dakota.  In fact, North Dakota and Alaska stand out dramatically from the pack: after the planned hiring surge North Dakota will have 66 contact tracers on staff per 100,000 residents, and Alaska will have 68.  \"North Dakota leadership believes widespread testing capacity paired with a robust contact tracing infrastructure are key components to rising above this current health challenge,\" Vern Dosch, contact tracing administrator for North Dakota wrote in a statement to NPR. \"We are committed to investing in the human resources and technology needed to make it happen. We are building tomorrow on facts, not fear.\"  Granted, North Dakota and Alaska have among the smallest populations of all states — hiring several hundred contact tracers to meet the need is certainly easier than onboarding 20,000 in California.  Including all planned staff additions, the average rate of contact tracers among the states we had data from would be 17 per 100,000 people – just above the estimated need during normal times, and half of what's projected to be needed during the coronavirus pandemic. The median is fewer: nine contact tracers per 100,000.  Watson warns states against playing this by ear. \"This is really something we shouldn't undershoot,\" she says. Of course, public health officials need to keep a close eye on transmission and cases — more cases means you need more contact tracers — but Watson says investing in contact tracing now is the smart move.  \"We're spending trillions of dollars on the economic aspects of this, which is important,\" she says. \"But if we're not willing to put in that same effort to the public health side to actually control this and to reduce the economic impacts — fighting this at its source — that doesn't make sense to me.\"  A patchwork of staff and plans in flux  Not every state responded to NPR's request. A few states – including Idaho and Virginia — did respond, but said they were not able to provide statewide numbers of contact tracers, because contact tracing is done by local health departments.  A spokesperson for the Michigan health department explained that state employees assist \"certain local health departments with case investigation and contact elicitation, which is the first step in the process of contact tracing,\" but the number of county staff that work to trace contacts was not available.  Other states that rely on county health departments to do contact tracing were only able to provide estimates of county staffing levels. Oklahoma's spokesperson explained that the 150 number of tracers they provided \"is a ballpark as we have county nurses who do multiple jobs including contact tracing.\"  Another state that was not able to provide contact tracer numbers was Georgia, which has already begun to ease social distancing measures. Spokesperson Nancy Nydam of the Georgia Department of Public Health told NPR that \"the total number of contact tracers will vary widely by [health] district, so we are not yet able to put an exact number to it.\" She added that the state was engaging with medical students and possibly the National Guard, and that more information would be available in the coming days.  In the survey, several states noted that their plans were very much in flux. \"As we are developing our plans, we are hiring and training an initial group of epidemiologists,\" a spokesperson for Colorado's Joint Information Center responded to NPR in the survey, noting they are starting with 50 epidemiologists for now but may add more in the coming weeks.  A few states, including Minnesota, indicated they do not have current plans to hire more contact tracers. Andrea Ahneman, a spokesperson for the COVID-19 Response in Minnesota, wrote that the state had more than 100 staffers now and that \"this is plenty of capacity for current needs.\" Minnesota later clarified to NPR that although it does not plan to hire new workers to do contact tracing, it does plan to reassign current state and local public health workers to do contact tracing, with a goal of reaching over 1,000 contact tracers over the next few weeks.  States that said they're seeking to expand contact tracing capacity are getting creative about finding the workforce. Nevada said it was recruiting volunteers for \"a dramatic expansion\" of its contact tracing capacity. Oklahoma is training fourth-year medical residents to do contact tracing. Maine has recruited some recently retired epidemiologists. Georgia and Iowa are planning to call on the National Guard.  About half of states surveyed indicated they were considering the use of smartphone or online apps to assist with contact tracing. Few had decided on a specific app, but several mentioned the Google app that's in development. Some states indicated that they hoped the federal government could assist with the cost of licensing these apps.  How the federal government can help  Asked what support each state could use from the federal government, several states — including Hawaii, Maine and Nevada — mentioned the need for funding to hire or train new contact tracers. A spokeswoman for the District of Columbia said that D.C. could use \"manpower and expertise, especially for training volunteers.\"  On the federal level, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides staff to support local contact tracing efforts. Director Robert Redfield told NPR last month that the agency has about 500 staff currently deployed to help state and local health departments, and that it would support another 650 positions with $45 million in funds. He has acknowledged decades of underfunding for public health and said that the federal government needs to \"augment personnel substantially.\" He also mentioned that his agency is in talks with other agencies and organizations with big boots-on-the-ground workforces to expand capacity.  A group of Democratic senators sent a letter to the CDC asking for details on these plans, but a congressional staffer tells NPR they have not received a response.  Numerous groups and experts are calling for more action and funds from the federal government. The group of former federal officials who wrote a letter last week calling for increased contact tracing hires also say $46 billion in federal funding is needed to pay for the hires and resources to help infected and exposed people stay isolated. A bill introduced in the House of Representatives Thursday calls for $55 billion to hire a national \"Health Force\" to do contact tracing and other public health work.  Scott Gottlieb, a former Food and Drug Administration chief for President Trump, told NPR that although assembling as many as 180,000 contact tracers nationally may be daunting, it's doable. \"We already see the states making efforts to bring on thousands of new public health workers to do contact tracing,\" he said. \"We're going to need this number of people if we want to enter into the fall with the kinds of resources we need to try to trace infection to prevent large outbreaks.\"  Federal leadership on contact tracing is important, says Watson of the Center for Health Security. \"This is unprecedented — this is not something we've done before as a nation,\" she says. \"It may be hard for some states to even think about how they get started on this, so guidance from the federal level is definitely needed.\"  Stephanie Adeline, Martha Bebinger, Natalie Krebs, Nicole Leonard, Aviva Okeson-Haberman, Sebastián Martinez Valdivia, Anh Nguyen, Bonnie Petrie, Paige Pfleger and Carmel Wroth contributed to this report.

The next phase of fighting the coronavirus leans heavily on contact tracing. And numbers will measure the result. How many people have tested positive? How many people have they recently contacted? And how quickly can those people be quarantined?  To establish those numbers, the United States needs a very large workforce of people to do contact tracing. Are we hiring enough people? NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin has spent the last week putting that question to officials in every single state, along with Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. And she's on the line. Selena, good morning.  SELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.   INSKEEP: What'd you find?  SIMMONS-DUFFIN: So we were able to get data from 41 states. And the total they currently have added up to 7,300. Most states said they were planning a hiring surge. And after that, we will have 35,600. This is a snapshot from the past week. And a lot is in flux. But that's our best estimate for what's planned, more than 35,000 contact tracers nationally.  INSKEEP: Which sounds like a lot. But is that enough?  SIMMONS-DUFFIN: The short answer is not even close. Yesterday on the show, you had some influential former officials saying the country needs 180,000 total. Other estimates have put the number needed at 100,000. Here's what Tom Frieden, former CDC director, told me about the totals we found.  TOM FRIEDEN: It's a start. I think an increasing number of health departments around the country recognize the need to substantially scale up activities.  SIMMONS-DUFFIN: One guidepost some epidemiologists have been using is, during a pandemic, you want 30 contact tracers per 100,000 residents. Only one state has that now and it's North Dakota. After the planned surge, only three more places will - Michigan, Nebraska and the District of Columbia.  Of course, if you have a huge population, this is a bigger task. California wants 10,000 contact tracers. And even then, it won't meet the threshold. A few other states that are building up - Louisiana is hiring 700 contact tracers. Texas is working towards 4,000, which has not been previously reported. And we have a state look-up online so you can see how your state stacks up at npr.org.  INSKEEP: OK. First, thanks for doing this work since this is being done state by state, which makes it hard to keep track of. Second, because it's not a federal effort, it is in the hands of every individual state. Does every state need to do more here?  SIMMONS-DUFFIN: So no one knows where this virus is headed or how severe a local outbreak could get. And as states ease social distancing, a situation that seems under control could change quickly. Still, a few states told us they were not planning to hire more. Minnesota was one.   INSKEEP: Wow.  SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Other states said, hey, we're playing this by ear. If we need more, we'll get more. I talked to Crystal Watson. She's a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. And she warned against this approach. Here's what she said.  CRYSTAL WATSON: It really is not a wait and see if we need it. It's we need it in order to open up and manage epidemics in different locations as they arise.  SIMMONS-DUFFIN: She says contact tracing is fighting back against the epidemic at its source. And it's a smart investment even if you ultimately overshoot and have too many contact tracers.  INSKEEP: Could some of the tens of millions of people who've filed for unemployment in recent weeks get these jobs?  SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Well, certainly. You don't need to be an epidemiologist to do it. But it is a job that takes empathy. Here's how Tom Frieden explained it.  FRIEDEN: You have to be able to engage in conversation with the patient. Earn, maintain their trust. Respect their confidentiality and privacy. Then you have to reach the contact, develop that same human bond with them.  SIMMONS-DUFFIN: There are lots of ideas from states on where to find contact tracers - medical students, the National Guard. And then there's the CDC, which has dispatched about 500 workers and plans to more than double that.  INSKEEP: OK. Up to 1,000. But we're talking about 100,000 or more. Are states having trouble paying for more contact tracers given that they all now face fiscal issues?  SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Right. One estimate for 100,000 tracers is it could cost $4 billion. States said they could really use more money from the federal government and more guidance on how to do this, how to create a giant, public health workforce on a dime.  INSKEEP: Selena, thanks for your reporting.   SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Thank you.  INSKEEP: NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.

Coronavirus is sweeping the globe, and cases are being declared every day with 93,158 infected globally since the virus began in China in December. Now in the UK, there are 85 diagnoses of coronavirus, and the Government has released its four-phase plan to tackle the spread of the virus.   Trending  Coronavirus - known officially as COVID-19 - targets the respiratory system and causes fever, coughing and shortness of breath. In severe cases, it can cause pneumonia and even death, to date killing 3,202 people around the world. There is advice for those who have travelled to and from areas of high risk - with some people warned to self-isolate for up to 14 days. Self-isolation means not attending work, school or any public areas, and staying home away from people. Read More: Coronavirus: Is this PROOF China's been lying about outbreak?

The change in legislation comes as the UK works towards containing the outbreak of coronavirus. Some countries have declared lockdowns, with Italy closing all schools and universities to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Earlier, England’s Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, said community transmission of COVID-19 is undoubtedly already occurring throughout the UK. Professor Whitty told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “At this point in time we think it is likely, not definite, that we will move into onward transmission and an epidemic here in the UK.”  Coronavirus sick pay: Prof Whitty said community transmission of COVID-19 is undoubtedly already occurring throughout the UK  He told BBC Breakfast there could be a need to do “extreme things” to protect the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions. But for most people, “this will be a mild or moderate disease, anything from a sniffle to having to go to bed for a few days, rather like with mild flu,” he said. On the NHS, Prof Whitty said: “The NHS will always cope because the NHS is an emergency service which is very good at adapting to what it finds itself with.” But he said if the UK sees a very large epidemic, “then it will put very high pressure on the NHS”, and there could be “several weeks which could be very difficult” for the health service and wider society.

No problem! A look at ways to self-isolate together  TORONTO — Social-distancing has forced Canadians into varying degrees of isolation, but that doesn't have to mean the end of movie date night, cocktails with pals or baby song circles.  Across the country, friends and strangers are finding innovative ways to continue socializing — while maintaining public health directives to limit face-to-face contact and the spread COVID-19.  Of course there are email, phone and video chats to keep us connected, but they largely restrict virtual hangouts to one-on-one affairs.  Those who crave bigger gatherings can consider videoconferencing tools including Zoom, Google Hangouts and House Party that allow multiple people to connect at the same time. Here's a look at some of the ways to self-isolate together:   BOOK CLUBS  The analog joys of the printed word are now being shared online as book clubs have been forced to skip in-person wine-fuelled hot takes for online wine-fuelled hot takes. Try a group call on Skype or connect through Microsoft Teams to keep your reading momentum going, or just feel like you're still part of the gang.   QUARANTINE AND CHILL  You may not be able to go to the multiplex, but you can still enjoy a flick with pals by downloading a Chrome extension that lets you sync whatever you're watching on Netflix. Netflix Party is supposed to allow you and other couch potatoes to follow the action together, pause together, and make snarky remarks in a chat box alongside the viewer. Alternately, a quick Google search turns up a plethora of other syncing apps that purport to work with various streamers, but may or may not be authorized partners. Of course, you could all just hit \"play\" at the same time while connected on Zoom, FaceTime or Google Hangouts.   SCAVENGER HUNT  Enterprising enclaves have introduced a neighbourly twist to the scavenger hunt by asking families to post drawings in their front windows for others to find on their daily walk-abouts. In one Ottawa neighbourhood, kids drew shamrocks and taped them to front windows for St. Patrick's Day, which neighbours had to find and tally. Upcoming themes for coming days include animals, encouraging words, and appropriately for April 1, jokes.   CIRCLE TIME  Babies need to see their buddies, too! And of course, regular social dates are vital for many new moms grappling with a strange new routine. Enter the online song circle — just like regular sing-alongs common at early years centres, but live-streamed into family homes. This way, babies can boogie in their living room to favourites like \"Roly Poly\" and \"Zoom Zoom Zoom\" while tired parents can take a break from making funny faces. In Toronto, College-Montrose Children's Place is streaming Saturday mornings and twice-daily weekdays on Facebook.   RAISE THE BAR, ONLINE  Trivia nights at the local pub can now be found online, while nights at the bar are being replicated virtually. Raise a glass this weekend to friends via webcam, no need to worry about figuring out who will be the designated driver. Of course, those who don't drink can also benefit from a weekend happy hour or virtual brunch, especially if structure has gone out the window due to lost work or school hours. And if it motivates you to tidy up the house and upgrade the attire from sweat pants, all the better!  THE SHOW MUST GO ON  Concerts and music festivals have been cancelled, but many performers are forging ahead with free or nearly free shows on Instagram Live, Facebook Live, Twitter and elsewhere. BYOB and mobile device for chatting and texting, of course, and enjoy an intimate set from acts big and small. Coldplay, John Legend and Neil Young are some of the bigger stars that have spread cheer in recent days, while Death Cab for Cutie frontman Ben Gibbard has been streaming live from his home studio every day.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said Friday it will tell nursing homes nationwide to come up with temporary restrictions that ban visitors and nonessential personnel with a few exceptions, such as end-of-life situations, said Seema Verma, administrator of the federal agency that oversees the nation's major health care programs.  \"These temporary national blanket waivers are reserved for the rarest of circumstances and they represent a massive mobilization of our country's resources to combat this terrible virus. And the flexibility we are offering will be a godsend to the providers, clinicians and facilities on the front lines of this fight.\"  The American Healthcare Association and the National Center for Assisted Living are also advising nursing homes to restrict nonessential visits to prevent their residents from being exposed to COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus.  “I would say the overwhelming majority of facilities are in a restricted visitation mode,” said Jessie Samples, executive director for the Tennessee Healthcare Association, the state chapter of the American Healthcare Association. “They are taking precautions that the people who would be coming in don’t pose a risk to the residents.”  CORONAVIRUS IMPACT: University of Tennessee, Johnson University move to online classes  Environmental Services member Maggie Masstrapa cleans behind an infection control warning poster at the Palm Garden of Tampa Health and Rehabilitation Center, March 5, 2020, in Tampa, Fla.

(Photo: Chris O'Meara, AP)  A 'hugger'? OK, but be conscientious  The restrictions came just hours before President Trump's news conference on the state of the coronavirus pandemic.  NHC Fort Sanders, a long-term care facility in Knoxville, announced Friday that new visitor restrictions will ban any visitors outside of emergency circumstances, a spokesperson told Knox News.  “This is vitally important because the population we serve, older, often frail, senior adults are the most vulnerable people affected by this disease,” said Stephen F. Flatt, Chief Executive Officer of National HealthCare Corporation in a company video released Wednesday.  The national organizations also recommend that nursing homes screen all visitors for potential illness and forgo field trips and community activities in areas where COVID-19 is present. They further recommend that physical contact, such as hugs and kisses, be limited.  “You hear this a lot in the South. ‘I’m a hugger.’ But our folks will be asking people to please just be conscientious about physical contact, “ Samples said.  He explained that nobody is banning visits or hugs outright. What they are asking is for families to be patient and conscientious. He acknowledged that restrictions can be difficult for families and residents.  CORONAVIRUS IN EAST TENNESSEE: Latest news and updates on impact of COVID-19  “I feel bad for the nursing homes because they have a very high risk group, “said Roberta Lavin, executive associate dean University of Tennessee Knoxville's College of Nursing, “It’s going to be really hard once one of their clients or staff members get sick.”   Extraordinary times, extraordinary measures  During a pandemic, nursing homes and long-term care facilities are caught in a difficult situation. The residents are not just elderly. They often have other chronic health conditions that make them more vulnerable to infections.  The staff of a well-run nursing home is always on guard for local outbreaks of infectious diseases, like flu. They typically have contingency plans in place in case a resident comes down with a contagious disease. Most of these plans are preventive, like good hygiene and facility cleanliness.  But for an epidemic or pandemic extra precautions must be put in place.  “In extraordinary times you have to take extraordinary measures,” Lavin explained.  She said that in ordinary circumstances, health care workers take many precautions that we may not notice, like keeping work clothes at the nursing home to avoid bringing contaminants inside. During a pandemic it becomes everyone's responsibility to help wherever they can. That might mean forgoing vacations and public gatherings or calling your elderly relatives instead of visiting them.  When asked about stories circulating on social media about older, retired people planning to continue with vacations, visitations or family gatherings Lavin had this to say:  “Our first duty is to our neighbor,” said Lavin, “To love that other person and show compassion for them.  “You have to sometimes inconvenience yourself to care for them,” she said.

At president, the extremely virulent virus is ravaging China — especially in Wuhan City, the epicenter of the outbreak, so much so that the city is importing funeral home workers from around the country and paying them $143 an hour just to process all the bodies, The Epoch Times reports.  CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield, in an interview last week, didn’t make any predictions about that kind of morbidity in the United States, but he did say that the outbreak will reach our country and become a “community virus” this year or even into next year.  “We don’t know a lot about this virus,” he told CNN’s Dr. Sanjay Gupta. “This virus is probably with us beyond this season, beyond this year, and I think eventually the virus will find a foothold and we will get community-based transmission.”  He added ominously: “Right now, we’re in an aggressive containment mode,” Zero Hedge reported.  As of last week, some 15 cases of the virus had been confirmed in seven states: Eight in California, two in Illinois and one in Arizona, Washington, Massachusetts, Wisconsin and Texas, CNN reported.  Redfield noted that while more research is necessary, his agency is now focused primarily on containment strategies in order to isolate the bug and slow its spread, thus buying more time to develop ways to combat it.  “The containment phase is really to give us more time. This virus will become a community virus at some point in time, this year or next year,” said Redfield. “We don’t have any evidence that this coronavirus is really embedded in the community at this time, but with that said, we want to intensify our surveillance so that we’re basing those conclusions based on data.”  ‘I would rather be criticized for over-protecting America’   CNN noted further:  The containment strategy refers to efforts to prevent widespread transmission of the coronavirus in the United States, including having people with confirmed cases stay in isolation and placing restrictions on travel between affected areas in the world. Such containment measures were used widely during the SARS global outbreak of 2003, during which 8,098 people worldwide became sick and of those, 774 died, according to the CDC.  The World Health Organization has said that global travel restrictions on foreign nationals could actually backfire, but the Trump administration has nonetheless implemented them against foreign nationals who have visited China within the past 14 days, barring them from entering the U.S. And anyone who has traveled to Wuhan City will be subject to a 14-day quarantine.  According to reports, WHO Director-General Tedros Ahanom Ghebreyesus voiced opposition to travel restrictions last week, saying, in part, that they would “unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade,” as well as create “fear and stigma.”   But Redfield dismissed that.  “Frankly, some people criticized when we decided that we wanted to temporarily suspend travel into the United States from individuals who were not Americans or permanent residents who had been in the hot zone in the last 14 days. Some people didn’t think that that was what they would do,” he told CNN.  “Well, we felt very strongly that our obligation was to do all we can to protect the American public,” he added. “I would rather be criticized for over-protecting America than under-protecting America at this stage.”  The U.S. military is also preparing, as Natural News reported. Site founder/editor Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, noted that the Pentagon sent out orders to the Northern Command to begin assessing its capabilities to handle a pandemic.  Plans “include ordering commanders to prepare for widespread outbreaks and confining service members with a history of travel to China,” the Military Times added.

As a result 2,000 were sent to Walsall Council for social care staff and 1,000 were donated to Lichfield District Council to help their Community Vulnerability Hub and the delivery of essential services.  Charles Lu, general manager of Super Smart Service said: “Super Smart Service provides the transit service for household essentials and medical supplies so we have a key role to play.  “As we know, China battled against this virus and has overcome it. The UK is now facing similar challenges and we wanted to show solidarity in the fight against Covid-19.  “The company and our long-term business partner Zongteng Group made this joint donation and wanted to help out local public sector organisations to support their magnificent efforts to support vulnerable people and keep essential services going.”  The offer was welcomed by Cannock Chase Council earlier this month.  Managing Director Tony McGovern said: “At a time when there are supply issues with some personal protective equipment due to high demand, this is an extremely generous donation by Super Smart Service and will directly help to support staff across the public sector who are dealing with very challenging circumstances.  “The masks are ideal for use in the community and some are suitable for NHS clinical settings.”  Diane Tilley, chief executive of Lichfield District Council said: “This is a magnificent gesture by a local company in these challenging times and we are already putting the masks to good use in the community where they are most needed to deliver our key services right now.”  Other public sector organisations were invited to bid for the remaining masks, in a process coordinated by the Staffordshire Local Resilience Forum (LRF).

The council also stocked up on 70 per cent alcohol gel sanitiser from a local company prior to shortages of this product occurring.  “Most recently, the LRF asked all district and borough councils – and Stoke City Council – to contact all funeral undertakers in their area and check if they had sufficient stocks of single use PPE to protect their staff in handling suspected or confirmed Covid-19 deceased (gloves, aprons, masks and eye protectors). If there are validated problems or gaps in supply, each local authority has been asked to be a supplier of last resort.  “Cannock Chase Council officers have completed this exercise and identified that some undertakers were struggling to get certain items of PPE and these have now been supplied  The council has recently been allocated a stock of PPE by the LRF that was part of a Government allocation for each LRF area.

That time, of course, was long ago, by which I mean last week. The good old days!  It’s different now. Now we are hunkering in our homes and keeping our social distance. We are also trying not to panic, which is difficult because every 14 seconds some health authority reminds us that this thing is going to get worse before it gets better and we don’t really know WHEN it will get better so for now you need to use common sense and remain calm and not panic and just REMAIN CALM BECAUSE THERE IS NO REASON TO PANIC even though we have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN and ...  ... and so on. So we were hunkered in our home, trying to figure out what to do besides wash our hands and not panic, and my daughter — whose return to college, like everything else, has been postponed — suggested that maybe we could do a jigsaw puzzle.  Local news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal  We didn’t have any jigsaw puzzles at home, so I, not really thinking it through, said, OK, I’ll go to Target and get one.  My wife looked at me as though I had volunteered to fight a bear.   ”Really?” she said.  ”I’ll be careful,” I said.  And so, armed with a small bottle of hand sanitizer (current retail value $17,000) I got in my car and set out for the Target store. Perhaps you are familiar with the TV series “The Walking Dead,” in which survivors of a worldwide plague of flesh-eating zombies must forage for supplies in a bleak post-apocalyptic landscape, constantly risking infection and death. This is how I felt, driving to Target. I tried to distract myself by listening to the radio, but this is what the radio sounds like now: “Coronavirus! Coronavirus! Coronavirus! After these messages, we’ll have more coronavirus!”  When I got to the Target store I kept at least six feet away from the other shoppers, which was easy because they were staying at least six feet away from me. Everyone was like: “I’M not a zombie. YOU’RE a zombie.”  The good news was Target had plenty of jigsaw puzzles. The panic-buying of jigsaw puzzles has not yet begun, unlike the situation with toilet paper, which is gone everywhere, thanks to the comprehension skills of the American public.  HEALTH AUTHORITIES: Wash your hands frequently, don’t touch your face and avoid unnecessary contact with others.  THE PUBLIC: So we need to buy toilet paper!  HEALTH AUTHORITIES: No, that’s not what we’re saying. We’re saying wash your hands, don’t touch your face and avoid unnecessary contact.  THE PUBLIC: Right! We’ll buy more toilet paper!  Anyway, I selected two jigsaw puzzles and paid for them without touching anybody. Then I sanitized my hands and drove home while trying not to touch my face, which let’s face it is not humanly possible.  So now in my house we’re passing the time between hand-washings by working on one of the puzzles. It’s a big one, 1,000 pieces, and we’ve only just started, so it’s still a confusing mess. We don’t exactly know what to do, and we don’t know how long it will take. But we’re going to stay with it, working together, not panicking, and in time we will solve it. And yes, this is a metaphor.

Wearing masks means we can cover up our easily sunburnt faces & no one will think weirdly of us for it. We could go outside wearing a mask, hat, and sunglasses, with almost our full faces covered (a ginger's dream!) and no one would think we're weird! Well, we're ginger, so they already think we're weird, but if we cover up our hair then they won't even know we're ginger! (Or can they smell it on us?...)  3. We can save our money and our skin from black mascara and other makeup, such as bronzer and spray tanner that covers up our true vampire nature.

There have been times in the 2,000-year history of the church that situations have prevented worshippers from gathering in churches to worship, but within living memory—and in many ways in all of history—we are living in unprecedented times. Most importantly, we are living in a time when the Church is being called in new and powerful ways to prayerfully reimagine what it means to be the Church.  The wonderful blessing of modern communication technology has really made a positive difference. Various means of livestreaming, video teleconferencing, and internet-delivered worship services are making a very positive difference. Surfing the internet, one can find countless creative expressions of “doing church” in properly socially distanced and shelter at home environment. The breadth of creativity is noting short of a blessing from the Holy Spirit.  In addition to holding worship by the internet, churches are also reaching out to members and those in need by assessing and addressing the needs of those stuck at home. Everything from delivering groceries to calls of encouragement and neighbors gathering in groups of less than 5 in driveways and front yards where proper physical distance is easily maintained are increasingly common. These are ways in which the human connection that is such a vital part of the church is increasingly maintained and cultivated.  Yet, these are just temporary things. Although it may seem like this Corona pandemic will never end because we are still in the frustrating moments when every day the bad news numbers are higher than the day before, there will come a time when the frightening numbers start to go down. Even though the world as we once knew it will never return to the old “normal,” in time we can trust that we will settle into a daily weekly routine that looks a lot more normal than anything we know now. Until that time, the Church has an amazing opportunity to really trust God and be the church like we have never seen before.  This is a time when the home church, family-led Bible Study, neighborhood-centered worship, and the values of faithful friendships may be cultivated in powerful and meaningful ways. It is a wonderful opportunity for the people of God to come together and be the people of God without being tied down to buildings, worship centers, and traditional expressions of Christianity.  It is noteworthy to remember that when the first apostles started gathering for regular worship and cultivating what would become known as the Christian religion, their customs, practices, and expressions of worship looked nothing like the modern church does. The early church was never structured around buildings and budgets, but rather it was built on faith, hope, and love. It was a community of people making a difference for the glory of God in the name of Jesus Christ. It was a community that was defined, not so much by where they gathered on Sunday morning or how they worshipped God, but rather by how they served God in community.  Finally, the church has one of the most important gifts to give the world today—the gift of hope. Whether people are bound to their homes or required to show up at work to provide essential services, the increasingly negative news about Corona is really discouraging people, driving fear, and creating very emotionally unhealthy realties. The Church is best suited in times like these to breathe a word of hope into a world desperately seeking hope.

That is a mouthful. Yet to those many experts who believe that only a successful vaccine will really beat this pandemic, it has a simpler name: hope.  Oddly, however, what such advances underline most is not how soon life may return to normal, but how far away that prospect is. Announcements about test and trace capability are a reminder that their weirdness will be standard for many months to come. And a vaccine - well that will not be ready, most think, before summer 2021 at the very earliest. The boss of Roche, among the world’s biggest pharma companies, thinks 18 months is “ambitious”.   The new normal  So we are forced to make the second great adjustment of this pandemic. The first, of course, was the realisation that this disease was to be taken deadly seriously, something which many of us failed to do - at Anfield and Cheltenham Festival and in concert venues and theatres across the country and no doubt in government too.  Perhaps that was understandable. We had also heard dim, dire warnings in 2002 and 2012 about far-off Sars and Mers - terrible diseases both - only to find life here blissfully unscathed. It took a while to swallow the truth that this time there was no dodging the bullet.  A month on, we now face another radical redrawing of everyday life, another time we are forced to cross the chasm between words that are easy to say and hear, and implications that are slow to dawn and hard to grasp.  It is this: the best we can do for the foreseeable future is manage Covid-19. We cannot beat it. We cannot cure it. We can barely treat it. We can only contain it and wait.  In this scenario all the government can do is merely adjust the dials on its no-win machine - finessing the balance of economic decline and deaths while tamping down infections across society as a whole.  What does that mean? It means that while the less vulnerable may shortly be released into a world of education and work and leisure that little resembles the one they left, the most vulnerable are on long-term lockdown.  It means that while the rest of us may be allowed out into a world without pubs and foreign travel, then periodically locked down again to prevent cases become clusters, and clusters becoming outbreaks, for those at high risk there is no way out - and little prospect of one.   Shielding the vulnerable  For this at risk group, for whom contracting the disease poses a serious risk of death, shielding remains the only option while the virus circulates among a population without herd immunity. As Scotland’s government put it its lockdown easing plan, published on Thursday: “continued shielding to protect those who are most at risk will almost certainly be required as restrictions are lifted”. The public will have to get used to the idea, one minister confided a few days ago, that “you can’t see Granny for 18 months”.  The vulnerable are already under far greater restrictions than the rest of us, having received letters or texts from the NHS advising they hide away for 12 weeks. Now that might as well be 12 months.  Nor is this a small group. Around 1.5m people are currently on the NHS “high and very high risk” register. Not all are old. Some have cystic fibrosis or severe asthma, or are undergoing chemotherapy, or on immunosuppression therapies, or are pregnant and have heart disease.  But the vast majority will be elderly. And, let us not forget, shielding rules are dramatic. There are three of them, but the last two are redundant because the first is so stringent: “Do not,” it states baldly, “leave your house.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 12, "positive": 16, "negative": 7, "disgust": 3, "joy": 1, "anger": 7, "fear": 9, "trust": 2}, "metadata": ["virus", "vaccine", "pharma", "deadly", "sars", "diseases", "adjust", "economic", "deaths", "vulnerable", "contracting", "lockdown", "easing", "minister", "nhs"]}, {"text": " “It’s business as usual.”  Sgt.

Sometimes it would be a week, two weeks,” said McLean County Sheriff Kerzmann.  With different government offices closed, the judicial system hasn’t changed either.

We will reassess the situation on the Tuesday after Easter,\" Merkel said in a telephone conference following a video meeting with regional state premiers.  German authorities on March 22 ordered restaurants shut and banned gatherings of more than two people to slow the spread of COVID-19.  The restrictions were initially slated to last two weeks, but will now be extended until April 19, to coincide with the end of the Easter school holidays.  Certain individual states including Bavaria -- Germany's largest by area -- had already announced an extension, and others will now follow suit in the coming days.  Merkel noted that the lengthened period of curbs means families may not be able to visit each other during Easter celebrations in Germany.  But she warned that a \"pandemic does not recognise holidays\".  The government has repeatedly rejected calls to relax the measures in recent days, with Merkel calling on the public to \"be patient\" in a podcast last weekend.  On Wednesday, the Chancellor reiterated that it was \"much too early to think about loosening the restrictions\".  \"It would be much worse to do it too early, and we are still very far away from what we need to achieve,\" she said.

The moment a man riding an electric unicycle zipped across a roundabout at nearly 30mph in Gloucestershire on Easter Sunday, shortly before being stopped by police  The man wobbled from side to side on the powered unicycle as he tore along main roads  After being pulled over, officers issued some 'words of advice' and took the unicyclist's details.  A tweet by Gloucestershire Constabulary said: 'Words of advice and details taken from a male riding a powered unicycle. 28mph+.  'Quedgeley to Moreton Valence via the A38. Danger to himself and other road users. Unstable upright riding at speed. Good use of issue bodycam.'  In a reply to another tweet, the police added: 'Full details and contact number, address were taken and strong words of advice also given.  A man rides a similar electric unicycle in Madrid during the Covid-19 lockdown this month  The four-mile route between the villages of Quedgeley and Moreton Valence, to the south-west of Gloucester, taken by the unicyclist as police followed  Gloucestershire Constabulary tweeted about the unicyclist incident over the Easter weekend  'The unicycle was electric charge. Not safe for the conditions of the road and other road users should he hit a pot hole and fall off. If reported in future we have his details.'  The journey mentioned between the two villages, located to the south-west of Gloucester is four miles via the A38 and would usually take less than 10 minutes in a car.  Electric unicycles, or EUC, have become increasingly popular in recent years. The rider controls the speed by either leading forwards or backwards and steers by twisting the wheel using their feet.  They have a mechanism that uses gyroscopes and accelerometers to maintain balance.

Cinda Campbell, a retired medical technologist, left the Hobby Lobby arts and crafts store with a bag she said contained Easter basket supplies. She was already out of the house for a doctor's appointment (an X-ray). She said she takes precautions like washing her hands and not getting close enough for people to sneeze or cough on her. Asked if she had any other activities planned, she responded, \"There's nowhere to go,\" referring to the growing list of entertainment, events, services, programs, churches, schools and other facilities that are closing.  Actually, one place to go was across the road, because the Kennedy Library was open. An elderly man walked out of the library with a couple of books under his arm. \"I'm not afraid of anything,\" said the man, who didn't want to be bothered. Why isn't he afraid of the coronavirus? \"I've been maintaining a life pretty well,\" he said before closing the door of his SUV.

On top of that, they again knocked him for not canceling his campaign rallies.  After claiming Trump “refused to take questions” from the press (he was several yards away and appeared to be walking to the West Wing while speaking to staff, and was giving a press conference during the report), Reid decried how he was continuing “to downplay the global epidemic, accusing Democrats and the media of trying to inflame coronavirus situation.”  What she was referring too was Trump sharing statistics showing that the flu season was much worse than the coronavirus outbreak, something even health professionals had admitted.  That was followed by a snide comment about how Trump was supposedly “publicly defying government recommendations on hygiene.” As she said that, a video of Trump shaking hands with supporters flashed on the screen. It was followed up with a soundbite of immunologist Dr. Anthony Fauci from NIH speaking about the importance of washing your hands. The obvious implication was that Trump doesn’t do that.  While Reid was trying to paint a false picture of the President, a mocking Politico article from 2019 dubbing the Trump years “the Purell presidency.”  “And the first thing he often tells his body man upon entering the Beast after shaking countless hands at campaign events: ‘Give me the stuff’ — an immediate squirt of Purell,” Daniel Lippman wrote at the time, before adding: “Two and a half years into his term, President Donald Trump is solidifying his standing as the most germ-conscious man to ever lead the free world.”  The Politico article also included tales of Trump kicking coughers out of rooms and smacking hands when a person licked their finger to flip a page.  Reid’s focus on Trump’s hygiene was followed up with the revelation that four GOP lawmakers who attended CPAC may have contracted the virus and were now in self-quarantine, two of whom had contact with the President since:  The contact occurred at a conservative convention in Washington less than two weeks ago. One, Georgia's Doug Collins, can be seen here with the President on Friday. And Florida's Matt Gaetz traveled on Air Force One with the President just today and announced his self-quarantine roughly an hour after landing.  Toward the end of the segment, Reid chided how a Women for Trump tour was canceled but the President’s campaign events were not. “The tour has now been delayed even as the President has yet to curtail his own campaign travel,” she said.  It was several minutes before CBS admitted that neither former Vice President Joe Biden nor Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) had stopped campaigning or shaking hands.

The press office for the town of Adeje confirmed that the restrictions are in place at the H10 Adeje Palace hotel.  Spanish media said some 1,000 tourists staying at the complex are not allowed to leave.  The Canary Islands, an archipelago located some 62 miles west of the African coast, is a popular holiday destination that attracts many British tourists all year around.  The hotel has been placed in quarantine after an Italian doctor staying there tested positive for the coronavirus (AP)  The archipelago’s president Angel Victor Torres said the Italian doctor who is positive for the disease has been quarantined in a local clinic while samples are analysed in a hospital near Madrid to confirm the initial diagnosis.  Spain’s Europa Press reported that the visiting tourist had arrived from one of the areas in northern Italy where a cluster of the coronavirus has infected hundreds of people. The patient voluntarily went to a clinic in Tenerife on Monday when he began feeling unwell.  It is Spain’s third case of Covid-19 and the second in the Canary Islands. A German tourist was quarantined earlier this month on the island of La Gomera and a British citizen in the Mediterranean’s Balearic Islands.  Both were released after recovering and showing no further symptoms of the illness.  The move comes as China and South Korea have reported more cases of the coronavirus as clusters of the disease grow in Europe and the Middle East amid rising global concern.  A worker disinfects a public bus against coronavirus in the city of Ahvaz in southwestern, Iran (Alireza Mohammadi/ISNA via AP)  Markets have been in decline around the world over virus fears, with Wall Street on Monday mirroring stock exchanges worldwide with a 1,000-plus point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  The White House has called for an urgent injection of 2.5 billion dollar (£1.9 billion) in government funds to help combat the disease, while Washington is set to call off planned annual military exercises with South Korea.  In Beijing, China’s government postponed its most important political meetings of the year.  The National People’s Congress – due to run for two weeks in early March – and the meeting of its chief advisory body usually bring thousands of delegates to Beijing.  The decision indicated the importance President Xi Jinping places on the battle against the epidemic that has posed one of his biggest political challenges since he took control of the ruling Communist Party in 2012.   (PA Graphics)  Similarly, the coronavirus began to emerge as a political threat to Donald Trump in election year, as attacks ramped up in the US over his administration’s handling of the outbreak.  China reported 508 new cases and another 71 deaths on Tuesday, 68 of them in the central city of Wuhan, where the epidemic was first detected in December.  The updates bring mainland China’s totals to 77,658 cases and 2,663 deaths.  South Korea now has the second-most cases in the world with 893 and has had a near 15-fold increase in reported infections in a week, with 60 new cases reported on Tuesday.  As South Korea reported its eighth fatality, health workers continued to find batches in the southeastern city of Daegu and nearby areas, where panic has brought towns to an eerie standstill.  South Korean President Moon Jae-in, third from right, salutes during a special government meeting to discuss measures to prevent the further spread of Covid-19 (AP)  Clusters have also emerged in Iran and Italy, and there are concerns the new outbreaks could signal a serious new stage in the global spread of the illness.  Schools were closed in Iran for a second day, and daily sanitising of public buses and the Tehran metro, which is used by some three million people a day, was started.  In several countries that reported their first cases on Monday – Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman, the infected patients had links with Iran.  Iraq and Afghanistan closed their borders with Iran in an effort to stop the further spread while Bahrain announced a 48-hour suspension of flights to and from Dubai, the world’s busiest international airport.  Airport staff check the temperatures of passengers returning from Milan as part of the coronavirus screening procedure at the Debrecen airport, Hungary (MTI via AP)  The virus also spread via tourists travelling within Italy, as the southern island of Sicily reported a positive case from a woman vacationing from Bergamo, in northern Lombardy. Two cases were also reported in Tuscany, well south of the epicentre.  She and her husband were put in isolation, and officials were tracing their contacts to try to contain the spread on the autonomous island, Sicily’s regional government said.  Civil protection officials on Tuesday reported a large jump of cases in Italy, from 222 to 283. Seven have died, all of them elderly people suffering from other problems.  Premier Giuseppe Conte shocked Lombardy officials by taking to task the hospital in Codogno, southeast of Milan, where Italy’s first positive patient went on February 18 with flu-like symptoms. The man was sent home, only to return a short time later with worsening conditions, at which point he was tested for the virus.  Many of Lombardy’s positive tests have a traceable connection to the Codogno hospital, including several doctors and nurses, patients and relatives who visited them.  Mr Conte told reporters that the Lombardy cluster grew “because of the hospital management that wasn’t completely proper according to the protocols that are recommended for these cases”.  One person was quarantined in La Gomera (PA)  “This surely contributed to the spread,” he said.  Lombardy’s chief health official, Giulio Gallera, expressed shock at Mr Conte’s remarks and defended the region’s handling of the crisis.  Austria temporarily halted rail traffic across its border with Italy and Slovenia and Croatia, popular getaways for Italians, were holding crisis meetings.  Schools were closed, theatre performances cancelled, and even Venice Carnival celebrations were called off.  “These rapid developments over the weekend have shown how quickly this situation can change,” the health commissioner for the European Union, Stella Kyriakides, said in Brussels.  “We need to take this situation of course very seriously, but we must not give in to panic, and, even more importantly, to disinformation.”  After the large increase in cases of Covid-19 – the disease caused by the coronavirus – in several countries, the World Heath Organisation said the virus had the potential to cause a pandemic.  “The past few weeks has demonstrated just how quickly a new virus can spread around the world and cause widespread fear and disruption,” WHO’s Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

(NYSE: OEC) today announced it is withdrawing its full-year 2020 guidance issued on February 20, 2020. The company also announced several proactive actions to maintain and strengthen its financial flexibility, including increasing its cash position and suspending its dividend.   Withdrawing Earnings Guidance  As stated in Orion’s earnings presentation dated February 21, 2020, the company’s guidance included its estimate of the 1Q20 financial and operational impacts of COVID 19. Given the increasing impact and uncertainty surrounding the duration, magnitude and geographic reach of COVID-19, and the likelihood that COVID-19 will have implications for our business for a prolonged period, the company is withdrawing its full-year 2020 guidance. Orion intends to provide an update as to the estimated financial impacts of COVID-19 during the company’s first quarter earnings conference call in May 2020, to the extent that available information permits.  Cash Bolstering and Financial Flexibility Enhancing Actions  As previously disclosed, the company had total liquidity of approximately $355 million as of December 31, 2019 mainly from a revolving credit facility and ancillary credit lines. As a proactive measure, the company partially drew down its revolver, effective March 24, 2020, to access cash sufficient to increase its cash position at quarter end to approximately $100 million from $63.7 million at December 31, 2019. The impact on the balance sheet of the increase in cash will be net debt neutral.  Orion’s previously announced interim dividend in the amount of $0.20 per Common Share will be paid on March 31, 2020 to holders of record as of the close of business on March 10, 2020, as planned. However, the Orion Board has suspended further dividend payments in order to enhance the company’s financial flexibility to successfully manage through the current pandemic and its aftermath.  Corning Painter, Chief Executive Officer, said, “Given the now global economic uncertainty COVID-19 has created, our ability to accurately predict the financial impact to Orion is limited. In the interest of being prudent and transparent, we believe it is appropriate to withdraw financial guidance for the year. While it is impossible to know the ultimate dimensions of the economic impact of COVID-19, we enter this period with a high performing global team, sound balance sheet, attractive debt maturity profile and substantial liquidity to withstand this economic downturn and emerge even stronger, when it is over.”  To learn more about Orion, visit the Company’s website at www.orioncarbons.com.

These statements constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

Forward-looking statements include, among others, statements concerning the potential exposure to market risks, statements expressing management’s expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions and statements that are not limited to statements of historical or present facts or conditions. You should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “anticipate,” \"assume,\" “assure,” “believe,” “confident,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “objectives,” “outlook,” “probably,” “project,” “will,” “seek,” “target” “to be,” and other words of similar meaning.

Wearing masks is especially recommended for people living in densely populated areas, the manual states.  Reducing the chances of inhaling the virus by wearing a protective mask cleaned thoroughly using a combination of approaches that use heat, ultraviolet light, water, soap and alcohol, will be vital to stopping its spread, the manual states.  A double layer of 100 per cent cotton cloth is about 70 per cent as effective as a surgical mask at capturing small particles (up to five times smaller than coronavirus). This material is breathable and it is easy to find around the house. These masks can be easily reused, the manual states.  Before making the masks, the fabric should be washed well and boiled for 5 minutes. Adding salt to this water is recommended, as per the manual.  It states that homemade reusable masks only reduce the chances of inhaling droplets still in the air from an infected person.  They do not give full protection. Homemade reusable masks must be washed and heated each day, as instructed. Reuse without washing should not be done, it adds.  The manual is meant to provide a simple outline of best practices to make, use and reuse masks to enable NGOs and individuals to self-create such masks and accelerate widespread adoption of masks across India, a statement said.  The key criteria for proposed designs are: ease of access to materials, ease of making them at home, and ease of use and reuse.

The racing organisation shared the decision to cancel the season opener hours before the first practice in Melbourne.  Several team-members were placed in quarantine after testing positive for the disease, leading to complaints across the sport.  Hamilton previously expressed concerns about the race – and he continued to express this message on Instagram.  He re-shared a post from January 28 on Instagram channel Karmagawa, which warned about the source of the disease in Whan’s markets where live animals were traded.  “Three million shares on this post and hardly anyone thought they would be directly affected,” he wrote.  “Let everyone learn we’re all on the same planet TOGETHER.  ‘What affects China affects us all.”  And he shared a post from the same channel of people in the area being affected by COVID-19, fainting in public as well as bodies being covered up.  Hamilton wrote: “Remember we warned about the coronavirus in January and people said we were taking it too seriously – how about now?”  The Mercedes racer went on to praise the organisation for cancelling the Australian GP.  “Sadly, this is the right decision,” they Brit added.  “No-one wants this, we all want to get in out cars and get racing, but we have to be realistic and we must put health and safety first.  “The reality is, this is really serious with people dying every day.  “There are lots of people ill and even if they’re not ill, many people are being affected financially and emotionally.  “No-one really knows the extent of what we are dealing with, but we should all take precautions to keep as many people as safe as possible.  “I know it’s disappoint as sport unites us when times are tough, but it’s the right call.  “Listen to advice everyone, keep safe. Hope to be back racing soon but in the meantime look after yourselves.”  And he sent a warning to fans.  Hamilton continued: “We are all in this together, whether you like it or not.  “This is affecting all of us around the world, our families and friends. We are all the same.  “I’m so sad to be faced with the reality that we will not be racing but this decision will save lives.  “For the fans who saved up and came all this way, I’m so sorry for you.

Advertisement Can blood from coronavirus survivors treat the newly ill? Share Shares Copy Link Copy  Hospitals are gearing up to test if a century-old treatment used to fight off flu and measles outbreaks in the days before vaccines, and tried more recently against SARS and Ebola, just might work for COVID-19, too: using blood donated from patients who’ve recovered.Doctors in China attempted the first COVID-19 treatments using what the history books call “convalescent serum” -- today, known as donated plasma -- from survivors of the new virus.Now, a network of U.S. hospitals is waiting on permission from the Food and Drug Administration to begin large studies of the infusions both as a possible treatment for the sick and as vaccine-like temporary protection for people at high risk of infection.There's no guarantee it will work.“We won’t know until we do it, but the historical evidence is encouraging,” Dr. Arturo Casadevall of Johns Hopkins University’s School of Public Health told The Associated Press.Casadevall drew on that history in filing the Food and Drug Administration application. The FDA is “working expeditiously to facilitate the development and availability of convalescent plasma\" a spokesman said.Here are some questions and answers about this latest quest for a treatment.WHAT EXACTLY IS THIS POSSIBLE THERAPY?It may sound like “back to the Stone Age,” but there’s good scientific reason to try using survivors' blood, said Dr. Jeffrey Henderson of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, who coauthored the FDA application with Casadevall and another colleague at the Mayo Clinic.When a person gets infected by a particular germ, the body starts making specially designed proteins called antibodies to fight the infection. After the person recovers, those antibodies float in survivors’ blood -- specifically plasma, the liquid part of blood — for months, even years.One of the planned studies would test if giving infusions of survivors' antibody-rich plasma to newly ill COVID-19 patients would boost their own body’s attempts to fight off the virus. To see if it works, researchers would measure if the treatment gave patients a better chance of living or reduced the need for breathing machines.One caution: While regular plasma transfusions are a mainstay of medicine, very rarely they can cause a lung-damaging side effect.COULD IT ALSO ACT LIKE A VACCINE?Sort of, but unlike a vaccine, any protection would only be temporary.A vaccine trains people’s immune systems to make their own antibodies against a target germ. The plasma infusion approach would give people a temporary shot of someone else’s antibodies that are short-lived and require repeated doses.Still, if FDA agrees, a second study would give antibody-rich plasma infusions to certain people at high risk from repeated exposures to COVID-19, such as hospital workers or first responders, said Dr. Liise-anne Pirofski of New York's Montefiore Health System and Albert Einstein College of Medicine. That also might include nursing homes when a resident becomes ill, in hopes of giving the other people in the home some protection, she said.“We need both things desperately,” Pirofski said. “We need to be able to break the cycle of transmission and we also need to be able to help people who are ill.”WHAT’S THE HISTORY?These plasma infusions were used most famously during the 1918 flu pandemic, and against numerous other infections, such as measles and bacterial pneumonia, before vaccines and modern medicines came along. In the Journal of Clinical Investigation earlier this month, Casadevall and Pirofski cited evidence that 1918 flu patients given the infusions were less likely to die. And a 1935 medical report detailed how doctors stopped a measles outbreak from sweeping through a boarding school using “serum” from prior patients.The old-fashioned approach still is dusted off every so often to tackle surprise outbreaks such as SARS in 2002, and in 2014 when Ebola survivors’ plasma was used to treat other patients during the West Africa epidemic. Even during those recent outbreaks, strict studies of the technique were not done, but Casadevall said there were clues that the plasma helped.Casadevall thinks that when it didn't work, it may have been used too late. \"Somebody at the end of their life, it’s very hard to affect” any disease at that point, he cautioned.A more modern approach is to brew this type of antibody in the lab, something Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and other companies are working on. Using blood from COVID-19 survivors is a decidedly more labor-intensive approach — but researchers could start banking the plasma as soon as regulators give the OK.HOW WOULD DOCTORS GET THE PLASMA?Blood banks take plasma donations much like they take donations of whole blood; regular plasma is used in hospitals and emergency rooms every day. If someone’s donating only plasma, their blood is drawn through a tube, the plasma is separated and the rest infused back into the donor’s body. Then that plasma is tested and purified to be sure it doesn't harbor any blood-borne viruses and is safe to use.For COVID-19 research, the difference would be who does the donating -- people who have recovered from the coronavirus. Scientists would measure how many antibodies are in a unit of donated plasma — tests just now being developed that aren't available to the general public — as they figure out what's a good dose, and how often a survivor could donate.Researchers aren’t worried about finding volunteer donors but caution it will take some time to build up a stock.“I get multiple emails a day from people, saying, ‘Can I help, can I give my plasma?’” Pirofski said.

(AP) — The U.S. Coast Guard has directed all cruise ships to prepare to treat any sick passengers and crew on board while being sequestered “indefinitely” offshore during the coronavirus pandemic.  The new rules require daily updates on each ship’s coronavirus caseload for vessels in U.S. waters, and come with a stiff warning: Any foreign-flagged vessels “that loiter beyond U.S. territorial seas” should try first to medically evacuate the very sick to those countries instead.  Many of South Florida’s cruise ships are registered in the Bahamas, where hospital capacity is limited and people are still recovering from last year’s Hurricane Dorian.  The rules, which apply to any vessel carrying more than 50 people, were issued in a March 29 safety bulletin signed by Coast Guard Rear Admiral E.C. Jones, whose district includes Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Puerto Rico.  Dozens of cruise ships are either lined up at Port Miami and Port Everglades or waiting offshore due to the coronavirus pandemic. Most have only crew aboard, but the Carnival Corp., which owns nine cruise lines with a total of 105 ships, notified the SEC Tuesday that it has more than 6,000 passengers still at sea.  Federal, state and local officials have been negotiating over whether two Holland America cruise ships, the Zaandam and Rotterdam, would be allowed to dock at Port Everglades this week. But more are on the way, including the Coral Princess, carrying what that ship’s medical center called a higher than normal number of people with flu-like symptoms.  Two of four deaths on the Zaandam were blamed on COVID-19 and nine people have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, the company said. At least 190 more reported symptoms. More than 300 Americans are on Zaandam and Rotterdam.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday that the state’s healthcare system is stretched too thin to take on the Zaandam’s coronavirus caseload. “Just to drop people off at the place where we’re having the highest number of cases right now just doesn’t make a whole lot of sense,” DeSantis said.  President Donald Trump said later that he would speak with his fellow Republican. “They’re dying on the ship,” Trump said. “I’m going to do what’s right. Not only for us, but for humanity.”  Under normal conditions, when a passenger or crew member become too ill for the ship’s medical team to care for, they call the Coast Guard to provide a medical evacuation to an onshore hospital. Under the new rules, sick passengers would be sequestered indefinitely on board.  For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.  “This is necessary as shore-side medical facilities may reach full capacity and lose the ability to accept and effectively treat additional critically-ill patients,” the memo said. “A potential evacuee has better access to comfortable surroundings and the medical staff on board the foreign passenger vessel where care is already being provided.”  The document requires all ships in U.S. waters to report their numbers of sick and dead on board each day or face civil penalties or criminal prosecution. The Coast Guard will decide if a transfer is absolutely necessary, but the cruise line would be responsible for arranging on-shore transportation and hospital beds.

The change feels most drastic in London, one of the world's biggest capital cities. Its nine-million population are nowhere to be seen, while tourists have been discouraged from visiting its famous sites.  Jam-packed streets that Londoners moan about have gone the way of the dinosaurs and the dodo, almost totally cleared as residents adjust to life under new draconian rules ordered by the PM on Monday.  From the pavements outside Buckingham Palace to Trafalgar Square and Piccadilly Circus; to the West End and its bars, restaurants, and theatres; footpaths, bridges, Tube stations, and shopping malls - all are devoid of life.  The Changing of the Guard has been suspended, while the Millennium Bridge over the Thames was deserted as galleries, pubs, and cafes were told to shut up shop under the virus had subsided.  Places of worships have been told to shut their doors, leading to the remarkable scenes out from St Paul's over the south bank of the river - now completely clear of people.  Tower Bridge was also free of its usual queues of traffic, while air quality is understood to have risen sharply since the lockdown came into force as drivers and taxis stick to the rules and stay home.  Canary Wharf station, at the heart of London's financial district, did not have a single banker or broker on its escalators on Tuesday, after only a handful of roles in the industry were granted key worker status.  ‹ Slide me › People walking across the Millennium Bridge with St Paul's in the background (left, March 13; right, March 26)  ‹ Slide me › London's National Gallery in Trafalgar Square before and after the lockdown (left, January 2014; right, March 2020)  ‹ Slide me › Buckingham Palace, usually packed with bustling crowds, has since emptied (left, March 13; right; March 24)  ‹ Slide me › Locals and tourists visiting London's Leicester Square before and during the lockdown (left, March 13; right, March 25)  ‹ Slide me › Commuters pictured crossing London Bridge before and during the lockdown (left, March 13; right; March 25)  ‹ Slide me › London's Criterion Theatre, where The Comedy About A Bank Robbery shows (left, March 12; right, March 24)  ‹ Slide me › Commuters pictured at Waterloo Station in London before and during the lockdown (left; March 12; right, March 25)  ‹ Slide me › The Palace Theatre, where the Harry Potter play is showing before and during the lockdown (left, March 12; right, March 24)  ‹ Slide me › Shots of London's Tower Bridge before and during the coronavirus lockdown (left, March 16; right, March 24)  The emptiness has spread beyond London - widely regarded the engine of the UK's viral outbreak - and infected Bath, now deserted as locals stay indoors and travellers from Bristol stay away.  The UK's wide beaches, enjoyed by local communities for decades, are now public mausoleums to their former playground status. Just a handful of strollers and joggers visit Bournemouth bay.  The Royal Mile in Edinburgh, normally one of the most popular areas of the Old Town, was also eerily quiet.  Organisers of one of the most popular events in the city's calendar, the Edinburgh Fringe festival, say they are still planning for the Fringe's programme of comedy and drama to go ahead as planned in August.  Even Barry Island, made famous by the TV series Gavin and Stacey, looks similarly abandoned by residents and tourists from around the country hoping to pose for photos at sites used in the programme.   These scenes come as:  The Prince of Wales tested positive for coronavirus but is only displaying mild symptoms;  The Foreign Office announced that Steven Dick, 37, the deputy head of mission at the British Embassy in Budapest, had died after contracting coronavirus;  NHS England said hundreds of thousands of tests for Covid-19 per day could become a reality within weeks;  Boris Johnson urged London Mayor Sadiq Khan to 'get more Tubes on the line' but resisted calls to ban non-essential construction workers from heading to building sites;  Parliament is set to adjourn for an early Easter break after emergency legislation is approved;  The PM said ministers are considering asking black taxi drivers to act as a transport service for NHS workers.  ‹ Slide me › Bath city centre before and during the PM's coronavirus lockdown (left, March 11; right, March 24)  ‹ Slide me › Bath city centre before and during the PM's coronavirus lockdown (left, March 11; right, March 24)  ‹ Slide me › Bath city centre before and during the PM's coronavirus lockdown (left, March 11; right, March 24)  ‹ Slide me › Edinburgh's Royal Mile before and during the PM's coronavirus lockdown (left, March 14; right, March 21)  ‹ Slide me › Barry Island in south Wales before and during the PM's coronavirus lockdown (left, September 2019; right, March 2020)  ‹ Slide me › Bournemouth beach before and during the PM's coronavirus lockdown (left, June 2019; right, March 2020)  ‹ Slide me › Bournemouth beach before and during the PM's coronavirus lockdown (left, September 2019; right, March 2020)  ‹ Slide me › Barry Island in south Wales before and during the PM's coronavirus lockdown (left, June 2017; right, March 2020)  Forty-three coronavirus deaths were recorded yesterday, compared to 87 on Tuesday - but new infections rose by 1,452 to 9,529 as Britons flouted the Government-imposed lockdown.  Twenty-eight more patients died overnight in England. Six more patients died in Scotland, five in Wales and four in Northern Ireland - bringing the total death toll to 465 in Britain.  They included a 47-year-old who did not have an underlying health condition. The others who died, including one person aged 93, did have underlying health conditions. In contrast, 87 infected Brits died the day before.  Despite the death rate falling by half, the country saw a record spike in cases on Wednesday, with 1,452 more patients known to have caught the deadly virus, bringing the total number of cases to 9,529.  The Department of Health and Social Care late yesterday confirmed a total of 97,019 people have been tested with found 87,490 negative. The update said that 463 people had been killed by the virus.  The update for the death toll on Tuesday was at 1pm, so the data only covers from then until 9am Wednesday, which would explain the slight difference in the death rate.  Scotland only announced two deaths yesterday, while Wales confirmed just one. Both countries have now had 22 coronavirus victims. Northern Ireland this afternoon announced two more fatalities as well as two last night.  The true size of the outbreak is being hidden because of the Government's controversial decision to only test patients in hospital. The true size of the outbreak is likely to be closer to the 400,000 mark.  Despite clear Government guidance members of the public are continuing to the rules by heading out to sunbathe on the second day of the coronavirus lockdown.  Footage has emerged showing police dispersing Britons gathering in parks and other public places, with people gathering despite strict advice to stay at home yo avoid the outbreak overwhelming the NHS.  In Shepherd's Bush in West London, people soaked up the sun, seemingly oblivious to the tight restrictions imposed by the government on Monday. Police were seen telling the sun worshipers to leave and go home.  Others were seen enjoying the weather at Battersea Park in South West London, on the beach in Portsmouth and in the sea off Eastbourne today despite the Prime Minister urging people to stay at home.  Meanwhile in Manchester, officers today dispersed groups, some of which greeted each other with a hug, along with sunbathers in Piccadilly Gardens. Police also used megaphones to tell people to stay at home unless absolutely necessary, saying 'this is serious, we need to beat corona.'

The Illinois Department of Public Health reported 1,105 new cases of coronavirus disease have been confirmed in the state as of Sunday, including 18 additional deaths.  The latest statistics released by health officials bring the state total up to 4,596 cases, including 65 deaths. Those deaths included 11 individuals in Cook County alone, in addition to deaths in DuPage, Kane, Kendal, LaSalle and St. Clair counties.  Bond, Knox, Menard, and Montgomery counties reported their first cases.  Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said Sunday the state is averaging 4,000 tests per day, and nearly 28,000 tests have been conducted. He expects within the next 10 days the state will conduct 10,000 tests per day.  To meet testing demands, the governor says a fifth drive-thru facility has been opened, and all state labs will be adding a second shift and eventually a third to meet demand. Instead of manually loading machines with tests, robotic machinery will start doing it.  The governor says they are tracking how many people are coming to the intensive care units and how many people need ventilators to see just how much this virus is spreading, but they didn’t say whether we’re flattening the curve yet in Illinois.  Watch Above: Governor JB Pritzker gives the latest update on the spread of COVID-19 in Illinois, and measures taken by the state  Also on peoples’ minds is the recent death of a 9-month-old from coronavirus disease, the first infant whose death has been connected to the virus in the United States.  “We have not seen infants with sickness, and definitely not death in the past. The symptoms for kids have been cold like symptoms in the literature that’s been published,” IDPH Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike said.  Still, the governor and the department of health are telling parents to try not to worry. While it’s a devastating loss, the limited scientific studies available show it is exceedingly rare.  The state’s stay-at-home order remains in effect until April 7. The order requires residents to stay home except for “essential” needs or business activities, and gatherings of 10 or more people are prohibited by the order.  The governor also had a message for landlords, reminding them that evictions are prohibited right now. In other states, nurses have had problems renting because of a fear of infection. The governor says he hasn’t heard of that happening here in Illinois, and it better not.  The Indiana State Department of Health reported 290 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state Sunday, bringing the state’s total to 1,514. So far, 32 people have died from COVID-19, according to the ISDH.  Confirmed coronavirus-related deaths in the United States surpassed 2,000 Saturday. Researchers say older people remain most at risk of dying as the new coronavirus continues its rampage around the globe, but they’re far from the only ones vulnerable.  On Sunday, the U.S. government’s foremost infection disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said the country will certainly have “millions of cases” of COVID-19 and more than 100,000 deaths during an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union.”  Also Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Americans should start to see checks from the $2 trillion stimulus bill direct deposited into their accounts over the next three weeks.

The Oxford team is racing to find a cure as it will be 'challenging' if the outbreak peaks, which the University of Washington researchers predict will hit Britian on April 17.  The Oxford team told The Telegraph: \"The best-case scenario is that by the autumn of 2020 we have the results about the effectiveness of the vaccine from a phase III trial and the ability to manufacture large amounts of the vaccine,\" according to Daily Mail.  If the outbreak goes out of control, it will be difficult to find unexposed people to take part in the trial, the researchers say. Currently, over 500 volunteers aged between 18 and 55 have signed up to the trial and will begin tests towards the end of the month.  \"Conducting trials after the peak subsides presents another problem, because so many people will have developed a natural immunity by then, and the amount of transmission will have dropped so that those who are still not immune will take longer to be exposed to the virus,\" the team of researchers added.  Trial participants will be injected with either the new Covid-19 vaccine or a control jab, and the study will extend for six months.

It may one day be said that the coronavirus delivered the deathblow to the New World Order, to a half-century of globalization, and to the era of interdependence of the world’s great nations.  Dr. Brian Monahan, attending physician of Congress, told a closed meeting of Senate staffers this week that 70 million to 150 million Americans — a third of the nation — could contract the coronavirus. Dr. Anthony Fauci testified that the mortality rate for COVID-19 will likely run near 1%.  Translation: Between 750,000 and 1.1 million Americans may die of this disease before it runs its course. The latter figure is equal to all the U.S. dead in World War II and on both sides in the Civil War.  Chancellor Angela Merkel warns that 70% of Germany’s population — 58 million people — could contract the coronavirus. If she is right, and Fauci’s mortality rate holds for her country, that could mean more than half a million dead Germans.  Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis called Merkel’s remark “unhelpful” and said it could cause panic. But Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch seemed to support Merkel, saying between 40% and 70% of the world’s population could become infected.  Again, if Fauci’s 1% mortality rate and Lipsitch’s estimate prove on target, between 3 billion and 5 billion people on earth will be infected, and 30 million to 50 million will die, a death toll greater than that of the Spanish Flu of 1918.  There is, however, some contradictory news.  China, with 81,000 cases, has noted a deceleration in new cases and South Korea appears to be gradually containing the spread of the virus.  Yet, Italy, with its large elderly population, may be a harbinger of what is to come in the West.  As of Thursday, Italy had reported 12,000 cases and 827 deaths, a mortality rate of nearly 7%. This suggests that the unreported and undetected infections in shutdown Italy are far more numerous.  In the U.S., the death toll at this writing is 39, a tiny fraction of the annual toll of tens of thousands who die of the flu.  But the problem is this: COVID-19 has not nearly run its course in the USA, while the reaction in society and the economy approaches what we might expect from a boiling national disaster.  The stock market has plunged further and faster than it did in the Great Crash of 1929. Trillions of dollars in wealth have vanished. If Sen. Bernie Sanders does not like “millionaires and billionaires,” he should be pleased. There are far fewer of them today than there were when he won the New Hampshire primary.  What does the future hold?  It may one day be said that the coronavirus delivered the deathblow to the New World Order, to a half-century of globalization, and to the era of interdependence of the world’s great nations.  Tourism, air travel, vacation cruises, international gatherings and festivals are already shutting down. Travel bans between countries and continents are being imposed. Conventions, concerts and sporting events are being canceled. Will the Tokyo Olympics go forward? If they do, will all the anticipated visitors from abroad come to Japan to enjoy the games?  Trump has issued a one-month travel ban on Europe.  As for the “open borders” crowd, do Democrats still believe that breaking into our country should no longer be a crime, and immigrants arriving illegally should be given free health care, a proposition to which all the Democratic debaters raised their hands?  The ideological roots of our free trade era can be traced to the mid-19th century when its great evangelist, Richard Cobden, rose at Free Trade Hall in Manchester on Jan. 15, 1846, and rhapsodized:  “I see in the Free Trade principle that which shall act on the moral world as the principle of gravitation in the universe — drawing men together, thrusting aside the antagonism of race, and creed, and language, and uniting us in the bonds of eternal peace.”  In the pre-Trump era, Republicans held hands with liberal Democrats in embracing NAFTA, GATT, the WTO and most-favored-nation trade privileges for China.  In retrospect, was it wise to have relied on China to produce essential parts for the supply chains of goods vital to our national security? Does it appear wise to have moved the production of pharmaceuticals and lifesaving drugs for heart disease, strokes and diabetes to China? Does it appear wise to have allowed China to develop a virtual monopoly on rare earth minerals crucial to the development of weapons for our defense?  In this coronavirus pandemic, people now seem to be looking for authoritative leaders and nations seem to be looking out for their own peoples first. Would Merkel, today, invite a million Syrian refugees into Germany no matter the conditions under which they were living in Syria and Turkey?  Is not the case now conclusive that we made a historic mistake when we outsourced our economic independence to rely for vital necessities upon nations that have never had America’s best interests at heart?

She said some members of the group who had originally tested negative have started showing symptoms of coronavirus like night sweats or fevers.  Wells, a retired nurse, said the members of the tour who have tested negative are separated from other guests who tested positive and served meals in their rooms. They will have a second test on Friday.  “This is not a bad situation,” she said. “At least we were tested quickly and are being well looked after.”  Wells and Carpenter, a retired former computer programmer, had planned a two-week holiday in Spain because they wanted to see the Iberian country.

It is the fourth worst-hit country, surpassed only by China, Italy, and Iran.  The total number of confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide surpassed 200,000 on Wednesday, according to Johns Hopkins University. The death toll topped 8,000.  The Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering’s online tally also showed more than 82,000 people have recovered. In Spain, more than 1,000 people have recovered.  Carpenter, a former U.S. Army medic who served in Somalia and the invasion of Iraq, was sanguine about the challenge he faced with his wife.  “I have been through the Somalia and Desert Storm so my attitude is if someone is not shooting at me I am okay. It might seem like an extreme attitude but that is the way I view life,” he told Fox News.

Sign up here.  Government officials from President Trump to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo have often referred to the coronavirus pandemic as a \"war,\" and some people who survive war, particularly combat veterans or those who are displaced by the conflict, struggle with a psychiatric condition known as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  PTSD is also found in victims of abuse and sexual assault, natural disasters, accidents and even pandemics, affecting both patients and health care professionals who are facing the battle are on the front lines.  Symptoms include recurring memories of the traumatic event, flashbacks, nightmares and physical or emotional reactions to a memory trigger. People who suffer from the disorder can experience negative thoughts about themselves or others, emotional numbness and self-destructive behavior, among other things.  DOGS ARE NOW BEING TRAINED TO SMELL CORONAVIRUS IN US PATIENTS  \"We know pandemics are terrifying to people,\" Dr. Royce Lee, who leads the University of Chicago Hospital's new disaster recovery program, told Fox News.  One of the distinguishing factors with COVID-19 compared to other pandemics, however, is how friends and families have to distance themselves from each other, which makes coping especially difficult.  Separation anxiety, plus the build-up of other factors including respiratory distress; a difficult prognosis; inflammation; activation of the immune system, which can have an emotional effect on the brain; and studies that show COVID-19 itself can impact the brain leads to \"a very big problem\" for PTSD in COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms, Lee said.  In health care professionals, Lee said \"studies from SARS show anywhere from 10 to 20 percent of doctors and nurses expect to get PTSD symptoms\" from the pandemic due to a combination of factors including stress, fear and separation from loved ones to avoid spreading the virus, among other things. While symptoms only last for about a year on average, the experience is \"highly stressful.\"  AS CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC CONTINUES, MANY AMERICANS ARE FEELING LONELY, ANXIOUS  Two medical professionals who worked on the front lines of coronavirus, including a 23-year-old New York City EMT and a 49-year-old medical director of the emergency department at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, committed suicide on April 24 and 26, respectively, highlighting the mental toll health care workers fighting COVID-19 are facing.  Dr. Joe Parks, medical director at the National Council for Behavioral Health, pointed out that people face a higher risk of getting PTSD if they have to endure a threat for an extended period of time without the power to change their circumstances or get out of a situation.  \"PTSD is most likely when things occur over an extended period of time where you just have to be in it or sit in it,\" Parks said. \"Combat is like that: You’re in your foxhole, you’re being shot at, and you have to stay there. Women get PTSD from domestic violence and they can’t get out. Clearly, coronavirus can have that effect on people. You feel threatened and your life’s in danger, and you can’t do anything about it.\"  He mentioned a friend who has been practicing medicine for \"30 or 40 years\" and said the COVID-19 pandemic was \"more difficult than 9/11\" because the terrorist attacks were more sudden and immediate while COVID-19 is drawn out, leaving people simultaneously restless and fatigued.  \"He saw ICU beds increase by 50 percent in two weeks,\" Parks said. \"Slowly watching the number of ICU ventilator beds dwindling is almost like having your feet in concrete and watching the water level rise.\"  PTSD related to COVID-19 is an issue that some hospitals didn't see coming as they struggled to contain the spread as quickly as possible with a severe lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and general knowledge about the novel virus from the outset.  NEW YORK EXPANDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR CORONAVIRUS FRONTLINE WORKERS, CUOMO SAYS  \"In times of a disaster or pandemic, every system has to make ‘Sophie’s choices,’\" Lee said. \"Some hospitals were hit so quickly, they had no time to prepare.\"  Now, hospitals across the nation are looking toward each other and past studies pulled from the SARS and MERS outbreaks to make sense of how to handle PTSD in COVID-19 patients and the health care workers who helped treat them. Lee said most PTSD therapy and general counseling programs for patients and workers are being set up within just months or even weeks. Some are getting funding from charities and nonprofits.  \"We have some scientific knowledge about this — some from early data SARS and MERS — where studies have been done of patients in the ICU, their families, doctors and nurses,\" Lee explained. \"Based on that data, we have a pretty good understanding of how PTSD might affect these groups [who suffered from COVID-19]. We looked at these data and based on that, we set up our program.\"  University of Chicago Hospital's relief program includes using technology to connect therapists with patients via iPad, a service in partnership with Emory University to speed up PTSD recovery training for therapists from 18 weeks to about six weeks, a support system for health care workers based on anonymous surveys, a stress resilience training program, and Zoom meetings focused on meditation and mindfulness, Lee said.  He added that recovery and relief programs like his at UCH are popping up all over the country. Fox News reached out to a number of hospitals across the U.S., as well as national health care systems and programs. While all hospitals acknowledged that PTSD is a relevant problem that is starting to appear more as death rates increase, not all hospitals seem to have invested the same amount of time and effort into creating PTSD relief programs.  New York's Mount Sinai Hospital has expanded its PTSD relief for health care professionals as they begin to start thinking about life after COVID-19. The hospital, which has been overwhelmed with COVID-19 cases since early March, even had to open an emergency field hospital due to its influx of patients on April 1.  Mount Sinai on Thursday opened its new Center for Stress, Resilience and Personal Growth, which provides resilience training for first responders; optional stress and mental health screenings for workers; and a number of interventions including workshops, support groups, individual assessments and mental health treatment, the hospital said.  Researchers at the hospital's Icahn School of Medicine, one of the leading institutions in the field of PTSD research, will also conduct a study of psychosocial factors associated with COVID-19 stress among Mount Sinai’s health care professionals and other front-line workers in the New York City community, according to the hospital.  \"Health care providers are working at an intensity level so stressful that tens of thousands will likely suffer post-traumatic stress disorder in the wake of the pandemic,\" Mount Sinai president for academic affairs Dr. Dennis Charney said in a statement. \"... Our goal through the Center is to understand and treat the profound anxiety and grief our heroic health care professionals are experiencing and will continue to face. We must help them recover to ensure the future of our health care system.\"  Henry Ford Health System in Detroit also launched a PTSD relief program this week, which includes a Community Emotional Support Line, a call center staffed by social workers, for adults and teenagers experiencing mental health difficulties associated with COVID-19. Henry Ford Behavioral Health Services' (BHS) providers, who have specialty training with PTSD, will supplement the call center team as needed, said Henry Ford Health System spokesperson Synthia Bryant.  The health system has also expanded its COVID-19 relief efforts for its health care workers, not only for those with PTSD but those who may be struggling with general mental health related to the pandemic.  \"Since the beginning of the crisis, Henry Ford has expanded its real-time offering of mental health services for our health care workers,\" Bryant said. \"Mental health resources include virtual employee assistance services (EAP), daily virtual support group meeting, an emotional support hotline, daily mindfulness sessions and training for leaders in how to recognize signs their staff may need support.\"  Banner Health System in Phoenix has dedicated several resources toward mental health for its team members on the front lines of the pandemic, including mobile-friendly support options, according to Banner Health spokesperson Alexis Kramer-Ainza.  One such option is a text-message support tool that gives team members links to access self-care tips, housing information, community offerings and more, and another is a telephone support forum for team members to have guided discussions; after-shift, call-in group conversations with trained discussion leaders.  The program also includes daily rounding with Banner teams, daily communication/updates and COVID-19 \"town halls,\" the spokesperson said. All efforts are intended to update team members on the latest COVID-19 developments, provide valuable resources, and address questions or concerns about workplace safety.  Other hospitals said they are preparing PTSD programs and plan to hire new therapists and psychologists for their respective hospitals but did not share much additional detail.  CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE  Parks explained that \"the nature of this kind of infectious disease had been theoretically planned for,\" but despite that planning, hospitals were unprepared for the actual reality of a pandemic at this scale, and future plans will have to contain \"a lot more attention to the psychological effects of a pandemic or disaster.\"  \"We're going to see an uptick of suicide and addiction, and we better be ready for it,\" Parks said. \"You’re going to see a variation in how sophisticated the response is, and in this situation, leadership matters.\"  Audrey Conklin is a staff reporter at FOX Business.

Asa Hutchinson said Arkansas has identified its first “presumptive” COVID-19 case. The patient, a resident of Pine Bluff, is in isolation and preliminary testing has been forwarded to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), where a second test will be conducted to confirm or reject the first results.  Hutchinson said the potential coronavirus patient had traveled to another state in the U.S. and was not an international traveler. The governor made the disclosure at a cabinet meeting in Little Rock on Wednesday (March 11).  Nate Smith, Secretary of the Health Department, said it was “not unexpected” with surrounding states seeing patients with the virus.  “Although this is a presumptive result… we’re moving ahead to gather more information,” Smith told reporters. He said there is no evidence the coronavirus had spread elsewhere in the Pine Bluff community or other parts of the state.  Hutchinson said he did not believe the one person identified as “presumptive” should lead to any major changes in personal behavior. He did offer some recommendations and said he planned to sign a declaration of emergency later today with more guidance.  The state Department of Health and Department of Human Services issued a directive earlier this week outlining procedures for health care officials to take extraordinary precautions to protect elderly residents in nursing homes and those with compromised immune systems in hospitals and other facilities.  Hutchinson also revealed that he is restricting out of state travel for state employees. He said during the cabinet meeting that he asked his secretaries to sign off on any out of state travel.  “It’s not a complete travel ban,” he said, “Just a precaution.”  Hutchinson also warned Arkansans who may be traveling with the upcoming Spring Break to “reconsider” their plans and to be careful with where they are headed.  “We hope to mitigate the risks caused by coronavirus,” he said. “We are as prepared as we can be for any upturn in an outbreak.”  UPDATE: Hutchinson signed the emergency order proclamation on Wednesday afternoon. The proclamation provides that the Secretary of Health may issue orders of isolation or quarantine “as necessary and appropriate” to control the spread of the coronavirus. In consultation with the governor, the secretary “shall have sole authority over all instances of quarantine, isolation, and restrictions on commerce and travel throughout the state.”  It also outlines broad latitude for the Secretary of Health, in consultation with the governor, to deal with matters of commerce, transportation, education and emergency management.

Restaurants must to shutter their dining rooms and only offer takeout or delivery.\"This is effecting the lives of our citizens. People are dying. Every day that is delayed here, I'm losing a dozen people on the back end that are going to die as a result of this,\" Sisolak said at a news conference Tuesday night.Sisolak's order follows similar moves by more than 10 other governors as states scramble to mitigate the risk of exposure to COVID-19.Nevada's governor gave thousands of businesses in the tourism mecca less than a day to prepare. Though a number of casinos started to close their doors this week, the governor's sweeping order shutters Nevada's main industry, anchored by glimmering casinos lining the Las Vegas Strip.The closures are part of federal guidance recommending social distancing. President Donald Trump has urged Americans to follow sweeping guidelines for the next few weeks, including for older residents to stay home and for all people to avoid gatherings of more than 10 as well as restaurants and bars.Sisolak's unprecedented order comes after many casinos in Las Vegas moved to shut their doors entirely and the mayor of Las Vegas said she hoped bars and restaurants would be able to stay open.\"My hope is that private industry rises to the top, that they're allowed to stay open and take care of these families that are paycheck to paycheck,\" Mayor Carolyn Goodman told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.The mayor of Reno had issued an order similar to Sisolak a day earlier, telling many of those non-essential businesses to close in that city starting Friday at 5 p.m. Mayor Hillary Schieve initially included casinos but rescinded that, allowing gambling operations to continue.The last time casinos closed in Las Vegas was for John F. Kennedy's funeral on Nov. 25, 1963. Michael Green, a history professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said in an email to The Associated Press Tuesday night that to his knowledge, it was the first time all Nevada casinos have been ordered closed statewide. He previously said this week's intentional casino closures may be only the fourth since gambling was legalized in Las Vegas in 1931.\"The state occasionally revoked a license and ordered one closed, but nothing like this,\" he wrote.Nevada has reported more than 50 cases of the virus so far, including one death. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.In Las Vegas, MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts announced earlier in the week they planned to close their properties. Tuesday morning, three more casino resorts joined in.The MGM casino closures of 13 properties included the Bellagio and its famous fountain show in front, which often draws a crowd to watch the fountains shooting as high 460 feet (140 meters) into the air, choreographed to lights and music.The Hoover Dam, near the Arizona border and another Nevada tourist attraction, is temporarily closing to visitors \"because of the nature of the structure and an inability to implement social distancing standards recommended by the\" CDC, according to a statement.With businesses closing and tourism expected to drop off, the state is forecasting a financial hit, but how big is unknown.In Nevada, gambling taxes are second only to sales taxes as a percentage of the state's annual budget. The leisure and hospitality industry directly employs one of every four workers in the state and has an economic output of about $68 billion in Nevada, according to the Nevada Resort Association.The state's biennial Legislature isn't scheduled to meet again until 2021, and legislative leaders are not yet planning to go into a special session to address Nevada's budget.Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro and Assembly Speaker Jason Frierson, both Democrats, said in a joint statement provided to the Associated Press on Tuesday that they're evaluating all options and they're working closely with the governor.But \"at this time, we have no plans to go into a special session,\" they said.State officials have not yet released any numbers of how many people have filed claims for unemployment benefits over the past few days.Sisolak said over the weekend that the state was in \"relatively good shape\" to pay unemployment claims but it cannot last forever and the state was working to get some additional assistance from the federal government.

This coronavirus pandemic is no exception.  Not only are the federal and state governments unraveling the constitutional fabric of the nation with lockdown mandates that are sending the economy into a tailspin and wreaking havoc with our liberties, but they are also rendering the citizenry fully dependent on the government for financial handouts, medical intervention, protection and sustenance.  Unless we find some way to rein in the government’s power grabs, the fall-out will be epic.  Everything I have warned about for years—government overreach, invasive surveillance, martial law, abuse of powers, militarized police, weaponized technology used to track and control the citizenry, and so on—has coalesced into this present moment. Battlefield America: T... John W. Whitehead Best Price: $10.95 Buy New $18.80 (as of 10:15 EST - Details)  The government’s shameless exploitation of past national emergencies for its own nefarious purposes pales in comparison to what is presently unfolding.  Deploying the same strategy it used with 9/11 to acquire greater powers under the USA Patriot Act, the police state—a.k.a. the shadow government, a.k.a. the Deep State—has been anticipating this moment for years, quietly assembling a wish list of lockdown powers that could be trotted out and approved at a moment’s notice.  It should surprise no one, then, that the Trump Administration has asked Congress to allow it to suspend parts of the Constitution whenever it deems it necessary during this coronavirus pandemic and “other” emergencies.  It’s that “other” emergencies part that should particularly give you pause, if not spur you to immediate action (by action, I mean a loud and vocal, apolitical, nonpartisan outcry and sustained, apolitical, nonpartisan resistance).  In fact, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has been quietly trotting out and testing a long laundry list of terrifying powers that override the Constitution.  We’re talking about lockdown powers (at both the federal and state level): the ability to suspend the Constitution, indefinitely detain American citizens, bypass the courts, quarantine whole communities or segments of the population, override the First Amendment by outlawing religious gatherings and assemblies of more than a few people, shut down entire industries and manipulate the economy, muzzle dissidents, “stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease,” reshape financial markets, create a digital currency (and thus further restrict the use of cash), determine who should live or die…  You’re getting the picture now, right?  These are powers the police state would desperately like to make permanent.  Bear in mind, however, that these powers the Trump Administration, acting on orders from the police state, are officially asking Congress to recognize and authorize barely scratch the surface of the far-reaching powers the government has already unilaterally claimed for itself.  Unofficially, the police state has been riding roughshod over the rule of law for years now without any pretense of being reined in or restricted in its power grabs by Congress, the courts or the citizenry.  This current pandemic is a test to see whether the Constitution—and our commitment to the principles enshrined in the Bill of Rights—can survive a national crisis and true state of emergency.  Here’s what we know: whatever the so-called threat to the nation—whether it’s civil unrest, school shootings, alleged acts of terrorism, or the threat of a global pandemic in the case of COVID-19—the government has a tendency to capitalize on the nation’s heightened emotions, confusion and fear as a means of extending the reach of the police state.  This coronavirus epidemic, which has brought China’s Orwellian surveillance out of the shadows and caused Italy to declare a nationwide lockdown threatens to bring the American Police State out into the open on a scale we’ve not seen before.  Every day brings a drastic new set of restrictions by government bodies (most have been delivered by way of executive orders) at the local, state and federal level that are eager to flex their muscles for the so-called “good” of the populace.  This is where we run the risk of this whole fly-by-night operation going completely off the rails.  It’s one thing to attempt an experiment in social distancing in order to flatten the curve of this virus because we can’t afford to risk overwhelming the hospitals and exposing the most vulnerable in the nation to unavoidable loss of life scenarios. However, there’s a fine line between strongly worded suggestions for citizens to voluntarily stay at home and strong-armed house arrest orders with penalties in place for non-compliance.  More than three-quarters of all Americans have now been ordered to stay at home and that number is growing as more states fall in line. The Change Manifesto: ... Whitehead, John W Best Price: $2.03 Buy New $10.60 (as of 01:25 EST - Details)  Schools have canceled physical classes, many for the remainder of the academic year.  Many of the states have banned gatherings of more than 10 people.  At least three states (Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania) have ordered non-essential businesses to close.  In Washington, DC, residents face 90 days in jail and a $5,000 fine if they leave their homes during the coronavirus outbreak. Residents of Maryland, Hawaii and Washington state also risk severe penalties of up to a year in prison and a $5,000 fine for violating the stay-at-home orders. Violators in Alaska could face jail time and up to $25,000 in fines.  Kentucky residents are prohibited from traveling outside the state, with a few exceptions.  New York City, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S., is offering its Rikers Island prisoners $6 an hour to help dig mass graves.  In San Francisco, cannabis dispensaries were included among the essential businesses allowed to keep operating during the city-wide lockdown.  New Jersey’s governor canceled gatherings of any number, including parties, weddings and religious ceremonies, and warned the restrictions could continue for weeks or months. One city actually threatened to prosecute residents who spread false information about the virus.  Oregon banned all nonessential social and recreational gatherings, regardless of size.  Rhode Island has given police the go-ahead to pull over anyone with New York license plates to record their contact information and order them to self-quarantine for 14 days.  South Carolina’s police have been empowered to break up any public gatherings of more than three people.  Of course, there are exceptions to all of these stay-at-home orders (in more than 30 states and counting), the longest of which runs until June 10. Essential workers (doctors, firefighters, police and grocery store workers) can go to work. Everyone else will have to fit themselves into a variety of exceptions in order to leave their homes: for grocery runs, doctor visits, to get exercise, to visit a family member, etc.  Throughout the country, more than 14,000 “Citizen-Soldiers” of the National Guard have been mobilized to support the states and the federal government in their fight against the coronavirus.  Thus far, we have not breached the Constitution’s crisis point: martial law has yet to be overtly imposed (although an argument could be made to the contrary given the militarized nature of the American police state).  It’s just a matter of time before all hell breaks loose.  If this is not the defining point at which we cross over into all-out totalitarianism, then it is at a minimum a test to see how easily we will surrender.  Generally, the government has to show a compelling state interest before it can override certain critical rights such as free speech, assembly, press, search and seizure, etc. Most of the time, it lacks that compelling state interest, but it still manages to violate those rights, setting itself up for legal battles further down the road.  These lockdown measures—on the right of the people to peaceably assemble, to travel, to engage in commerce, etc.—unquestionably restrict fundamental constitutional rights, which might pass muster for a short period of time, but can it be sustained for longer stretches legally? A Government of Wolves... John W. Whitehead Best Price: $1.16 Buy New $2.99 (as of 10:15 EST - Details)  That’s the challenge before us, of course, if these days and weeks potentially stretch into months-long quarantines.  At the moment, the government believes it has a compelling interest—albeit a temporary one—in restricting gatherings, assemblies and movement in public in order to minimize the spread of this virus.  The key point is this: while we may tolerate these restrictions on our liberties in the short term, we should never fail to be on guard lest these one-time constraints become a slippery slope to a total lockdown mindset.  What we must guard against, more than ever before, is the tendency to become so accustomed to our prison walls—these lockdowns, authoritarian dictates, and police state tactics justified as necessary for national security—that we allow the government to keep having its way in all things, without any civic resistance or objections being raised.  Most of all, don’t be naïve: the government will use this crisis to expand its powers far beyond the reach of the Constitution.   That’s how it starts.  Travel too far down that slippery slope, and there will be no turning back.  As I make clear in my book “Battlefield America: The War on the American People,” if you wait to speak out—stand up—and resist until the government’s lockdowns impact your freedoms personally, it could be too late.  Just because we’re fighting an unseen enemy in the form of a virus doesn’t mean we have to relinquish every shred of our humanity, our common sense, or our freedoms to a nanny state that thinks it can do a better job of keeping us safe.  Whatever we give up willingly now—whether it’s basic human decency, the ability to manage our private affairs, the right to have a say in how the government navigates this crisis, or the few rights still left to us that haven’t been disemboweled in recent years by a power-hungry police state—we won’t get back so easily once this crisis is past.  The government never cedes power willingly.   Neither should we.  The Best of John W.

He cited the university’s massive $40 billion endowment as a reason why the college should not have dipped into the fund.

Gavin Newsom’s continuing statewide orders barring such moves during the coronavirus pandemic.  Modoc County is “moving forward with our reopening plan,” Deputy Director of Emergency Services Heather Hadwick said in an email to The Associated Press early Friday. She said the county still has no COVID-19 cases.  Hadwick said the county of about 9,000 n the state’s far northeast corner on the Oregon border had not heard back from the governor about its reopening plan, but she asserted that the plan aligns with Newsom’s indicators for reopening.  At the Country Hearth restaurant in the town of Cedarville, three customers came in for breakfast, owner Janet Irene said.  This is a breaking news update. AP’s original story is below:  The news hit Orange County like a cold wave: California’s governor was shutting down the beaches.  A “hard close” order took effect on Friday for seashores from wealthy Newport Beach to artsy Laguna Beach and down Doheny way.  It followed a weekend where tens of thousands of the landlocked and homebound hit the sands south of Los Angeles County, where beaches have been closed for weeks. Newsom scolded people for defying the spirit of his statewide stay-at-home order, designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus that has killed some 2,000 people in the state.  “People that are congregating there, that weren’t practicing physical distancing … may not even know that they contracted the disease and now they put other people at risk,” Newsom said.  Newsom said he hoped it would be “a very short-term adjustment,” although the directive had no termination date.  Maureen Osborne is a resident of Huntington Beach, which proudly declares itself “Surf City, USA.” She was torn by the closure of the sweeping, scenic beach just a 10-minute walk from her home.  She hasn’t gone there much since the coronavirus outbreak because the neighbourhood has become crowded with visitors who park their cars to walk down to the shore. But wishes she could.  “It is what it is,” said the 62-year-old, who now carries a mask with her as a precaution when she goes out. “If people are sensible and do what they’re supposed to with the social distancing — but not everybody is.”  Newsom, a Democrat, has engendered strong bipartisan support for most of his actions during the virus outbreak. But more recently, some of the more rural and GOP-leaning areas of the state have begun chafing against what they see as an overly cautious move toward reopening California, which has seen its 40 million people cloistered and its economy hemorrhage jobs because of mandated business closures.  Newsom’s beach order was condemned as punitive, political overreach by some Republican lawmakers, especially those in Orange County, where the GOP hopes to regain ground lost to Democrats in what was once a Republican stronghold.  “At a time when California is granting early release to high-risk sex offenders and other dangerous inmates due to COVID-19 concerns, the implicit threat to punish beachgoers and surfers who violate the order is absurd,” state Sen. Patricia Bates, R-Laguna Niguel, said in a statement.  Huntington Beach and Dana Point city councils voted Thursday to pursue legal challenges against the order. Newport Beach planned to discuss its challenge options this weekend.  Elected officials in beach communities such as San Clemente argued that they are well aware of the need to contain the virus and are succeeding in reducing the threat countywide through safe practices.  It’s the same argument made in Modoc County in California’s northeast corner. That county, which has about 9,000 residents, planned to allow hair salons, churches, restaurants and its only movie theatre to reopen Friday, becoming the first county in the state to ease out of stay-at-home orders and flout the governor’s mandate.  Ned Coe, a cattle rancher and county supervisor, said Thursday that the county bordering Oregon has no confirmed COVID-19 cases and after consulting with health officials, the Board of Supervisors voted to reopen.  “Just as our physical health is vital for our citizens, so is the mental health and the economic health of our citizens,” Coe said.  Newsom did not say whether he would move to stop the reopening.  Orange County, by comparison, is home to more than 3 million people. The county’s Health Care Agency on Thursday reported an additional 145 confirmed COVID-19 cases, bringing the total to around 2,400 with 45 deaths.  On Wednesday, administration officials spread the word to police and other local officials that the governor planned to order all California beaches closed. That evening the California Police Chiefs Association sent a bulletin to its members alerting them so they would have time to plan for it.  However, a senior administration official who was not authorized to publicly discuss internal deliberations told The Associated Press that Newsom’s final decision wasn’t made until Thursday morning.  Newsom then announced a shutdown order covering only Orange County. That angered local officials, who said the vast majority of beachgoers act responsibly and are being punished unfairly.  County Sheriff Don Barnes said he would focus on cautioning and educating people that they must practice social distancing rather than citing them for violating the state order.  “I have no desire to enforce any aspect of that through arrest,” he said.  California Coastal Commission Chair Steve Padilla said he supports the governor’s action.  “I had COVID-19, was hospitalized for three weeks and in ICU on a ventilator for eleven days fighting for my life,” Padilla said. “So take it from me — we need to listen to the governor and stay home until it’s safe.”   ___  Associated Press reporters Kathleen Ronayne in Sacramento, Stephanie Dazio in Los Angeles, Olga R.

Bernard Sanders on Wednesday suspended his presidential bid, paving the way for Joseph R. Biden‘s coronation as the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee and leaving far-left voters mulling their options.  Mr. Sanders said he came to grips with the “painful” reality that he no longer had a feasible path to the nomination and that he couldn’t in good conscience push ahead amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  “So while we are winning the ideological battle and while we are winning the support of so many young people and working people throughout the country, I have concluded that this battle for the Democratic nomination will not be successful,” Mr. Sanders said in a livestream from his home state of Vermont. “So today I’m announcing the suspension of my campaign.  “While this campaign is coming to an end, our movement is not,” he said. “The fight for justice is what our campaign has been about. The fight for justice is what our movement remains about.”  The announcement set the stage for the long-anticipated general election showdown between President Trump and Mr. Biden.  The former vice president faces the challenge of unifying the party around his bid. Far-left and young voters who flocked to Mr. Sanders‘ vision for the nation are skeptical of Mr. Biden‘s bid.  Mr. Biden sought to bridge that gap Wednesday by praising Mr. Sanders for creating a political movement that has driven the national conversation on issues such as climate change, universal health care and student debt relief.  “While the Sanders campaign has been suspended, its impact on this election and on elections to come is far from over,” Mr. Biden said.  “More than any one issue or set of issues, I want to commend Bernie for being a powerful voice for a fairer and more just America,” he said.  Mr. Trump also pursued Mr. Sanders‘ supporters in his typical bold fashion. He blamed Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who accused Mr. Sanders of saying a woman couldn’t win the White House, for sinking his bid, and he poked at the wounds of 2016 when leaked emails showed Democratic National Committee staffers preferred Hillary Clinton to Mr. Sanders.  “Thank you to Elizabeth Warren,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter. “If not for her, Bernie would have won almost every state on Super Tuesday!”  “This ended just like the Democrats & the DNC wanted, same as the Crooked Hillary fiasco. The Bernie people should come to the Republican Party, TRADE!” he tweeted.  The suspension of Mr. Sanders‘ bid marks the end of a quest for the White House that began five years ago when he announced his long-shot bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.  Defying expectations, he won 23 contests against Mrs. Clinton and developed a grassroots “revolution” that shifted the Democratic Party further to the left by adopting, among other issues, a $15-per-hour minimum wage, tuition-free college and “Medicare for All.”  “It was not long ago that people considered these ideas radical and fringe,” Mr. Sanders said Wednesday. “Today they are mainstream ideas.”  The movement helped the likes of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the liberal firebrand from New York City who volunteered for Mr. Sanders‘ 2016 campaign before knocking off one of the top House Democrats in the 2018 midterm primaries.  Mr. Sanders was far better prepared this time. He had a national brand and a grassroots fundraising network that was unmatched in the nomination race.  But he faced a much broader field of contenders — many of whom had adopted signature parts of the far-left platform that he popularized.  Mr. Sanders started the race with a bang.  He finished a close second in the Iowa caucuses before rattling off a pair of clear-cut victories in New Hampshire and Nevada that gave him a surge of momentum heading into South Carolina.  His success, however, scared the less-liberal ranks of the party, who worried that his brand of democratic socialism would be too extreme for much of the nation, making it harder to oust Mr. Trump and strengthen Democrats’ numbers in Congress and statehouses across the country.  The race changed dramatically after Mr. Biden easily won South Carolina. Soon afterward, he picked up endorsements from three of his former rivals: former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas.  Mr. Biden followed that up with a dominant performance on Super Tuesday and went on to victory in Michigan, which Mr. Sanders won in 2016.  Making matters worse, exit polls showed Mr. Biden winning states where a majority of Democrats aligned with Mr. Sanders‘ ideas.  Then the coronavirus outbreak froze the campaign.  “I know there may be some in our movement who disagreed with this decision, who’d like us to fight on to the last ballot cast at the Democratic convention. I understand that position,” Mr. Sanders said.  “But as I see the crisis gripping the nation exacerbated by a president unwilling or unable to provide any kind of credible leadership and the work that needs to be done to protect people in this most desperate hour, I cannot in good conscience continue to mount a campaign that cannot win and which would interfere with the important work required of all of us in this difficult hour,” he said.  Mr. Sanders described Mr. Biden as a “very decent man” and vowed to work with him “to move our progressive ideas forward.”  Others said it will be difficult for Mr. Biden to get Mr. Sanders‘ supporters excited about his campaign.  “They are more likely to stay home,” said RoseAnn DeMoro, former executive director of National Nurses United and a vocal Sanders backer. “It would take something set in stone that is real change, which the [corporate backers] will stop.”  Eight liberal groups, including the Justice Democrats and NextGen America, wrote an open letter urging Mr. Biden to make commitments to excite young voters.  They demanded that he block current or former Wall Street executives from serving in his Cabinet, create a post for a national director of gun violence prevention, and pledge to appoint a director of homeland security who is committed to “dismantling” Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection “as we know them.”  “The victorious ‘Obama coalition’ included millions of energized young people fighting for change,” the letter says. “But the Democratic Party’s last presidential nominee failed to mobilize our enthusiasm where it mattered. We can’t afford to see those mistakes repeated.”  Sign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters  Copyright © 2020 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.

WASHINGTON — A new executive order from Governor Larry Hogan requires Marylanders over the age of nine to wear a face-covering during essential trips to places like grocery stores and public transit.  Hogan announced the executive order during a coronavirus briefing on April 15, saying the move will help promote safety efforts that could get Maryland to safely re-open sooner. The order goes went to effect at 7 a.m. on Saturday, April 18.  “While this order is an important step in our immediate efforts to protect public health and safety, the wearing of masks is also something that we may all have to become more accustomed to in order to safely reopen our state,\" Hogan said.  Here's how the state defines what needs to be worn: “Face Covering” means a covering that fully covers a person’s nose and mouth, but is not a Medical-Grade Mask. The term “Face Covering” includes, without limitation, scarves and bandanas.  The list of places where a mask is required includes:   Grocery stores   Convenience stores   Farmers markets   Pharmacies   Takeout restaurants   Laundromats   Liquor stores   Cleaning supply stores   Home good stores   Public Transit  Parents with children ages 2 to 9 years old must do their best to make sure their kids have face coverings on in food and retail businesses.  A person is subject to up to one year of imprisonment or a fine of up to $5,000 if found violating the order.

About Severe Hypoglycemia  Hypoglycemic events of any severity are a daily concern for people with diabetes. Mild or moderate hypoglycemia can occur multiple times a month. Severe hypoglycemia is characterized by severe cognitive impairment, requiring external assistance for recovery, and can be extremely frightening for patients and caregivers. Severe hypoglycemia can result in cardiovascular disease, seizure, coma, and, if left untreated, death. These severe hypoglycemic events can occur multiple times a year. Such events require emergency assistance from another person or caregiver such as a family member, friend, or co-worker.   About Glucagon  Glucagon is a metabolic hormone secreted by the pancreas that raises blood glucose levels by causing the liver to rapidly convert glycogen (the stored form of glucose) into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream. Glucagon and insulin are two critical hormones in a glycemic control system that keep blood glucose at the right level in healthy individuals. In people with diabetes who are dependent on insulin, this control system is disrupted, and insulin must be injected to avoid high levels of blood glucose (hyperglycemia). The opposite effect, or low blood glucose (hypoglycemia), is also prevalent in this population due to dysregulated glucagon secretion. Severe hypoglycemia is a serious condition and can lead to seizures, coma, potential brain injury and, if untreated, death.  Glucagon is the standard of care for treating severe hypoglycemia. According to the American Diabetes Association, glucagon should be prescribed for all individuals at increased risk of clinically significant hypoglycemia, defined as blood glucose <54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L). Leveraging XeriSol™, one of Xeris’ two proprietary formulation technology platforms, Xeris has the potential to provide the first ready-to-use, room-temperature stable liquid glucagon for use by people with diabetes and other conditions to prevent or manage various forms of hypoglycemia and improve glucose control.

A new study by Morgan Stanley estimates the deficit will total at least $3.7 trillion this calendar year, and $3 trillion next year, financed by the sale of Treasurys, largely to the Federal Reserve.  Depending on how much the U.S. economy declines, that could push the federal deficit to 15 to 20 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), a level not approached since the second World War.  By any accounting, the federal deficit will blow past the post-war record of 9.8 percent of GDP, set in fiscal 2009.  The US federal surplus or deficit as a percent of GDP is seen from 1929 to the present. Recession years are shaded in grey  Federal deficits topped 25% of GDP during WWII, as the government poured massive resources into defeating the Axis. Pictured: A tank assembly line in Detroit during the war  In response to the downturn caused by sweeping shutdowns aimed at containing the outbreak, President Donald Trump on Friday signed into law a $2.2 trillion aid package, the largest ever.  'Except for wartime expenditures during World War II there is nothing comparable to this in U.S. history,' said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in response to the aid package.  In response to the pandemic, a once-in-a-generation crisis, the government doesn't shy from nearly unlimited spending. In Congress, Democrats and Republicans were virtually unanimous in supporting the aid package.  According to Morgan Stanley's projections, deficit spending in the next two years could drive the national debt to around $29 trillion from an estimated $23.6 trillion right now.  At some point, the reckoning will come in the form of higher taxes or spending cuts, but it may not be for some time.  In 1942, workers are seen building a B-17 Flying Fortress plane at the Lockheed plant in Burbank, California  Gross federal debt is seen as a percent of GDP going back to 1939. Federal debt is already at its highest level since WWII and is only set to grow in coming years  Other reports also indicate the federal deficit will set a post-war record in the coming years.  Analysts at Wells Fargo said on Tuesday that the U.S. government is likely to increase its debt by $1.4 trillion in the second quarter, as it raises cash to finance stimulus that is meant to blunt the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.  This includes sending checks to Americans and rushing billions of dollars to medical providers on the front lines of the pandemic.  'That´s really an immediate need for cash,' said Zachary Griffiths, an interest rate strategist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte, North Carolina. 'It all comes together in heavy issuance needs as the Treasury steps in with this fiscal stimulus.'  The government has also delayed the deadline for filing income taxes to July 15, from April 15, which increases its debt needs.  In fiscal year 2020, the federal budget deficit is likely to increase to $2.4 trillion, or 11.2 percent of GDP, a post-war record, Wells Fargo said.  For the 2020 calendar year, the bank expects U.S. government debt to rise by $2.8 trillion on net.  The USNS Comfort arrives in New York Harbor on Monday to assist in the COVID-19 response  The Treasury Department this week has announced $145 billion in cash management bills, which are short-term securities issued by the Treasury to help it manage its cash needs.  It is expected to continue to issue these bills and raise the size of its regular Treasury bill auctions, Wells Fargo said.  It is also likely to increase the size of its longer-dated debt auctions, though most of the initial increase in supply is expected to be in the bill market, the bank said.  Interest costs on the debt are likely to stay relatively low, however, as the Federal Reserve buys an unlimited amount of bonds to help support market functioning.  'It´s a staggering amount if you look at just the dollar totals, but also staggering is how much the Fed has purchased,' Griffiths said.  Wells Fargo expects the Fed to ultimately absorb around three-quarters of the net increase in outstanding Treasuries this calendar year.

The absurd overreaction comes as media hysteria drove a false news story that attempted to blame President Trump for the death of an Arizona man after he and his wife ingested fish tank cleaner with a similar name.  As a result, Sisolak issued an executive order prohibiting prescriptions for the two drugs – chloroquine (the Arizona couple took chloroquine phosphate) and hydroxychloroquine – for use in patients suffering from coronavirus.  Is the mainstream media corrupt? Yes, it's pretty obvious No, they are fair and balanced Email Results Vote  Could Lead to Further Deaths  “While the two drugs have necessary medical purposes, there is no conclusive evidence at this time among COVID-19 experts or Nevada’s own medical health advisory team that the drugs provide treatment for COVID-19 patients,” a statement by Sisolak reads.  Not only is Sisolak’s power-grab an overreach of government on a grand scale, but it could potentially lead to more deaths due to the coronavirus.  Doctors seeking to use the potentially life-saving drugs in compassionate care situations will now be prevented from doing so.  President Trump says it “would be a gift from Heaven..

Sisolak’s move was no exception.  Ryan Fournier, a co-chair of Students For Trump, railed against Sisolak noting that his ban “comes after people have seen success following drug testing.”  “This is ridiculous,” he added.  The drugs banned in Nevada are in fact being used in clinical trials, with Fox News reporting, “They are among a select group of possible therapies the World Health Organization is currently looking at as potentially treating or preventing COVID-19.”  Rather than wait for consensus from the medical community, Nevada’s TDS infected governor prematurely banned the use of malaria drugs as a potential treatment for the coronavirus purely to spite President Trump https://t.co/vuA4EboY4z — Dan Bongino (@dbongino) March 25, 2020   Idiotic Move coronavirus malaria  It’s truly difficult to report on this move by the Nevada Governor as anything short of idiotic.  He’s, quite literally, banning drugs currently being tested for use in coronavirus patients simply because he fell for a fake news story about a man who consumed fish tank cleaner.  Clinical trials have begun in New York, the state hardest hit by the coronavirus in the country.  A statement by Governor Andrew Cuomo’s office notes that New York has received “70,000 doses of hydroxychloroquine, 10,000 doses of Zithromax and 750,000 doses of chloroquine to implement drug trials.”  “We hope for optimistic results,” Cuomo said during a press conference. “The president and the FDA accelerated that drug coming to New York so the hospitals will start using that drug today.”  Imagine that – A power-grab so outrageous that Andrew Cuomo won’t even go there.  Obviously there isn’t enough evidence to say these drugs will work yet, but Cuomo is at least giving it a try and others are doing trials to see if it could be successful.   Sisolak’s actions threaten lives.

DeWine, local health departments and our health care systems to ensure that we don’t get to that point where we have to take that step back.”  On May 1, DeWine issued Stay Safe Ohio – an amended order that promotes rolling out a slow, progressive reopening of businesses as long as employers and employees comply with safety protocols set by state health officials. The reopening began Monday with previously closed offices, manufacturers, construction and distribution. It continues today with hospitals, dentists, veterinarians and other health care providers more fully opening their doors, followed by retail on May 12.  While employees are mandated to wear a facial covering, unless they meet exception guidelines, DeWine lifted a requirement for customers to wear a facial covering.  Tekac and Dr. James Kravec, chief clinical director for Mercy Health both say the state is not reopening too soon. The key to not have a spike in cases is to practice social distancing, wearing a mask, proper hygiene and other health protocols.  While national reports forecast a massive uptick by June 1 in cases and deaths from COVID-19, the disease spread by coronavirus, Kravec doesn’t see that happening in this region.  “The governor is not fully opening the state, but using a strategic plan to open. We’re going to monitor stats like we do daily so we don’t overwhelm our health care system,” Kravec says.  Tekac says the health department will work with business on safety requirements to ensure employees and customers remain safe. Tekac suggest if customer believe businesses aren’t complying with safety protocols to address concerns with mangers, but reports can be made to the health department.  “We will work with employers to bring them into compliance,” he says.  The same measures hold true for office workers.  Tekac also thanked local school superintendents for working with the health department for safe guidelines in holding graduation ceremonies.  Several schools are planning ceremonies where graduates will be awarded their diplomas and have no more than four guests. Other schools will allow graduates to walk through stadiums maintaining social distancing. See local school websites for more information.  Copyright 2020 The Business Journal, Youngstown, Ohio.

According to East Asia and Pacific in the Time of COVID-19, the World Bank’s April 2020 Economic Update for East Asia and the Pacific, the virus that triggered a supply shock in China has now caused a global shock.  It said that the developing economies in East Asia and the Pacific (EAP), recovering from trade tensions and struggling with COVID-19, now face the prospect of a global financial shock and recession.  Sound macroeconomic policies and prudent financial regulation have equipped most EAP countries to deal with normal tremors, but an unusual combination of disruptive and mutually reinforcing events is being witnessed there.  “Significant economic pain seems unavoidable in all countries. Countries must take action now – including urgent investments in healthcare capacity and targeted fiscal measures – to mitigate some of the immediate impacts,” the report added.  In a rapidly changing environment, making precise growth projections is unusually difficult, therefore, the report presents both a baseline and a lower case scenario.  Growth in the developing EAP region is projected to slow to 2.1 percent in the baseline and to negative 0.5 in the lower case scenario in 2020, from an estimated 5.8 percent in 2019.  Growth in China is projected to decline to 2.3 percent in the baseline and 0.1 percent in the lower case scenario in 2020, from 6.1 percent in 2019. Containment of the pandemic would allow for a sustained recovery in the region, although risks to the outlook from financial market stress would remain high.  The COVID-19 shock will also have a serious impact on poverty, the report added.  The report estimates that under the baseline growth scenario, nearly 24 million fewer people will escape poverty across the region in 2020 than would have in the absence of the pandemic (using a poverty line of US$5.50/day).  If the economic situations were to deteriorate further, and the lower-case scenario prevails, then poverty is estimated to increase by about 11 million people. Prior projections estimated that nearly 35 million people would escape poverty in EAP in 2020, including over 25 million in China alone.  Among the actions recommended by the report are urgent investments in national healthcare capacity and longer-term preparedness.  The report also suggests taking an integrated view of containment and macroeconomic policies. Targeted fiscal measures – such as subsidies for sick pay and healthcare – would help with containment and ensure that temporary deprivation does not translate into long-term losses of human capital.  The report calls for international cooperation and new cross-border public-private partnerships to ramp up the production and supply of key medical supplies and services in the face of the pandemic, and to ensure financial stability in the aftermath.  Critically, trade policy should stay open so medical and other supplies are available to all countries, as well as to facilitate the region’s rapid economic recovery.  Another policy recommendation is easing credit to help households smooth their consumption and help firms survive the immediate shock.  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, economic circumstances within countries and regions are fluid and change on a day-by-day basis. The analysis in the report is based on the latest country-level data available as of March 27.  The World Bank Group is rolling out a $14 billion fast-track package to strengthen the COVID-19 response in developing countries and shorten the time to recovery.

The Senate is held by Trump's Republican allies while the House is controlled by Democrats.The memo, obtained Monday by The Associated Press, also seeks to limit the number of coronavirus-related appearances on Capitol Hill for those at key departments responding to the pandemic.

The report stressed that international rather than club football had driven growth of the women’s game and that this should be given priority in the rebuild of the women’s football industry.  “This all points to the need for FIFA and the regional confederations to better coordinate the women’s international match calendar with leagues, and the current crisis presents an extraordinary opportunity to do so,” it said.

You have none? You must go back into the dark.\"  Immunity certificates: a load of nonsense and a covert op  —-Once again, in this article, I step into the world of official gibberish about the epidemic and the virus and tests and so on. I point out the internal contradictions in the government position. And then I step back and look at what they’re really up to, in the way of a covert operation. Let’s start with the official word on so-called immunity certificates.  (To read about Jon’s mega-collection, The Matrix Revealed, click here.) POLITICIO, 4/10: “Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, revealed Friday the federal government is considering issuing Americans certificates of immunity from the coronavirus, as the Trump administration works to better identify those who have been infected and restart the U.S. economy in the coming weeks.” “The proposal is contingent upon the widespread deployment of antibody tests which the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration are in the process of validating in the U.S., Fauci said.” “Although coronavirus testing thus far has been able to determine if an individual has an active infection, antibody tests report whether an asymptomatic person was previously infected but has since recovered [and is immune], potentially allowing them to return to their jobs.” Now let’s take that POLITICO article apart. Immunity certificates would be issued to people who test POSITIVE on an antibody test. Meaning: antibodies in a person’s body are a sign that he has gained immunity from the coronavirus.  But wait. How about this? Science News, March 27: “Science News spoke with…Charles Cairns, dean of the Drexel University College of Medicine, about how antibody tests work and what are some of the challenges of developing the tests.” “Cairns: ‘The big question is: Does a positive response for the antibodies mean that person is actively infected, or that they have been infected in the past [and are now immune]...?’” What?? In other words, when you penetrate an inch below the surface, you find there are even official/mainstream doubts, grave doubts about the meaning of a positive antibody test. It could mean IMMUNE or it could mean INFECTED. This would be like saying, “The photo either proves there was a sixteen-car wreck on Highway 5 or it was smooth sailing and there was no accident at all.” Actually, since 1984, a positive antibody test has generally been taken to mean the person is infected, has the disease in question. So why the sudden turnaround now? Why are Fauci and other government officials claiming that a positive antibody test signals immunity?  Answer: Because, with the widespread use of this simple and quick antibody test (much quicker and easier to perform than the current PCR test), a reason is invented for issuing immunity certificates. And this is what the goal is. Introduce the population to immunity certificates. As a tune-up for the underlying operation, which is: Immunity certificates for people who eventually receive vaccinations against COVID-19 (and, finally, all vaccines). Just take the COVID-19 vaccine and you’ll be immune and you can carry with you a certificate, wherever you go—-and you WILL be allowed to go here and there and live a normal life. With your paper or digital or tattoo immunity certificate. Whether the certificate plan will be enacted this time around (COVID-19), or in the next fake pandemic, remains to be seen. But the IDEA is now firmly planted in the public mind. You can win a “gold star” on the blackboard from the teacher—-your certificate to a better life. Just obey and follow orders. TAKE THE VACCINE. Carrot and stick. Be free, or be limited. If, indeed, we see a COVID-19 vaccine introduced, another variation on this operation would be: “Under Emergency regulations, everyone must take the shot.” But when you do, you’ll get your very valuable certificate of immunity. You’ll win a prize. Isn’t that wonderful? No. It isn’t. It’s Corona Bologna. It’s all about CONTROL. And in this article, I haven’t discussed questions about what would actually be IN the COVID-19 vaccine. I took up that subject in a recent piece about DNA vaccines. The new DNA technology, if introduced, would PERMANENTLY alter the genetic makeup of the vaccine-recipient. And meanwhile…don’t you just love the idea of the government first locking you up, and then “freeing” you with an official seal of approval? “The gate is open for you, sir. You have your papers. But you, sir, you must go back. No papers.”   SHOW DISQUS COMMENTS  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 7, "positive": 12, "negative": 5, "disgust": 2, "joy": 2, "anger": 4, "surprise": 2, "fear": 9, "trust": 7}, "metadata": ["immunity", "epidemic", "virus", "institute", "infectious", "americans", "trump", "infected", "economy", "fauci", "coronavirus", "recovered", "antibodies", "university", "college", "challenges", "introduce", "vaccine"]}, {"text": "tudies show the effect may be so powerful that it can improve our relationships  The bad news seems to come from all directions at the moment.

But as counter-intuitive as it sounds, experts say this crisis – or rather, the experiences gained, and lessons learned during it – might in time give many of us a psychological boost.  Studies show the effect may be so powerful that it can improve our relationships, strengthen our mental fortitude and actually ease many of the anxieties we feel about modern life.  Evidence points to unexpected upsides to tragedy and turmoil – and there is some truth in the old saying: ‘That which does not kill us makes us stronger.’  David Murphy, president of the British Psychological Society and a clinical psychologist for around 30 years, says: ‘I do believe that it’s possible to “grow”, even in challenging times like the current pandemic.  ‘My first job was working with people with spinal cord injuries. Most of the patients I worked with had been fit and healthy and suddenly their lives were turned upside down by an accident that left them paralysed for life.  Pictures posted by the singer during lockdown at home. Sam said: 'I didn’t mean any malice... it hadn’t been picked up very well'  ‘Many experienced depression and hopelessness. Often this improved as time went on. Sometimes it didn’t. But I was inspired by the fact that many patients also discovered strengths in themselves that even they didn’t know they had.’  In fact, in the world of psychology, there is an unusual phenomenon where some victims of physical tragedy become more resilient, have greater self-confidence and look to take on new challenges in life – not shy away from them.   It’s called post-traumatic growth.  But can large populations reap the same kind of benefits from the sort of terrifying crisis we are living through now? The scientific evidence suggests they can.  In 2011, a huge earthquake struck Christchurch, New Zealand. More than 180 people died and thousands of homes were destroyed.  But a study of almost 100 residents, published in the Australasian Journal Of Disaster And Trauma Studies, found many felt stronger as a result of their experience.  They reported improved relationships, a greater appreciation of life and a renewed sense of community – having all lived through the trauma together.  Staying optimistic is key, says American academic Professor Martin Seligman, as is building strong relationships with others and focusing on our strengths (file photo)  And research examining the effect of the 2003 SARS outbreak on people in Hong Kong – one of the areas most badly affected by that pandemic – found similar positive effects on mental health.  More than 60 per cent of respondents said they cared more about family members’ feelings in the aftermath and more than a third found friends and family were more supportive, according to a study published in the Journal of Infection. So could the Covid-19 pandemic make us more resilient?  ‘It’s certainly possible,’ says Murphy. ‘And it’s likely that some people will find a new sense of self-belief – after surviving, or perhaps even thriving, in the face of all this uncertainty.’  This may be particularly true for younger people – often unfairly referred to as the ‘snowflake generation’. It’s true that younger people are more likely to have mental health problems than older people, who – some studies suggest – are generally more resilient.  One theory – albeit a controversial one – for this apparent fragility is that younger generations are overprotected from the harsh realities of life, have a lot of support from their families and, in some cases, haven’t had to face any real adversity.  Now, with restrictions on freedoms and social lives, could more people discover the resilience that helped previous generations through poverty, world wars and strike-induced power blackouts?  Professor Martin Seligman – an American academic known as the father of positive psychology – believes we can all learn to cope better with crisis.  Staying optimistic is key, he says, as is building strong relationships with others and focusing on our strengths, not weaknesses. He suggests doing simple exercises – such as writing down three things that happen every day that you are grateful for – to help with this.  Experts say this crisis – or rather, the experiences gained, and lessons learned during it – might in time give many of us a psychological boost (file photo)  Of course, it is vital not to forget the people who are facing real adversity at the moment.  From the many living in inadequate housing, to those who are juggling their job with caring for a loved one, or trying to cope with mental health problems and domestic violence. And it is very easy, from a position of relative comfort, to skim over this, to get a bit emotionally carried away by the ‘British bulldog’ spirit.  ‘I think it’s important to recognise that we are not all in this together,’ says Murphy.  ‘The realities of the current situation are very different depending on our own circumstances.  ‘However, we are all affected by this crisis in some way. And – for all of us – regardless of our current challenges, there is possibility that we may emerge stronger and more resilient when this is finally over.  ‘We may be able to re-evaluate priorities, appreciate the things that are really important in life and the true value of human connection.’  Most of us – given the choice – would swap this strange world we are living in for our former lives.  But we don’t have that choice.  And while the positives which may come out of this crisis can never make up for all the suffering and hardship, perhaps we can take some comfort in these glimmers of hope.

'It was a suicide mission,' said passenger Jenny Harrell, of Fredericksburg, Virginia. 'It was a mass triage with absolutely no direction and the crew going, 'What should we do now?''  Decisions were left up to the passengers, said Harrell, who had some emergency medical training in the past and helped a physician who was also among the passengers.  The jet carrying 359 people, including hundreds of American and Canadian passengers from a Costa Cruises ship flying home from France, landed at Atlanta's international airport as emergency responders, and health and customs officials deployed to screen them for the coronavirus.  Three people on the flight tested positive for the coronavirus before landing but had no symptoms, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Thirteen others were sick but hadn't been tested, and one passenger was sent to a local hospital.  Harrell, 51, said she isolated two other passengers who were having breathing problems. One had a chronic lung disease and needed to be hooked to a ventilator, she said. Another passenger had an asthma attack and several others fainted, apparently from low blood sugar levels. Harrell said many travelers were coughing and she helped treat people who had a fever.  'There should have been medical personnel on that flight,' Harrell said.  Costa Luminosa passengers also complained they were given no food other than orange juice and crackers in more than 24 hours \" the time it took to disembark in Marseille, France, to fly to Atlanta, and be cleared by officials.  At one point, Harrell said, the flight attendants handed her the cabin microphone.  'I basically took over the plane,' she said. 'I couldn't even make this up for a movie.'  In another instance, the co-pilot asked her and others whether they should land in Bermuda, instead of continuing all the way to Atlanta.  'We didn't have a choice. We had been turned away for the last eight days,' Harrell said.  For many, the flight was a culmination of an already harrowing journey that began on March 5 in Fort Lauderdale. Some passengers said they wanted to cancel the trans-Atlantic cruise, but the company refused to give them a refund, assuring them it was safe to go three days before the U.S. State Department issued a warning for U.S. citizens not to travel on cruise ships.  On March 8, an Italian woman disembarked in Puerto Rico with breathing problems. She and her husband, who also got off the boat, were hospitalized and tested positive for the new coronavirus. Since the new cases came to light, the Costa Luminosa was denied entry to several countries.  The 1,400 passenger ship was finally allowed permission to dock in Marseille, France, under strict quarantine conditions. The local administration for the Marseille region said in a statement that 36 people have tested positive for the new virus.  The screening process for the passengers who got on the flight to the U.S. isn't clear, but Harrell said many of the passengers were visibly sick when they boarded the jet.  'They just wanted us to get home so we could be taken care of here,' she said. 'Everybody, basically, on that flight had medical conditions.\"  After the plane landed, Harrell called 911 because CDC officials wanted to start screening, but she demanded food first. She was afraid they would have to wait for a long process before they had anything to eat.  The CDC said all passengers were screened and 'three passengers who were reportedly tested previously and found to be positive for COVID-19 were separated from other passengers.' Federal officials are working with Georgia authorities to determine a plan for those passengers.  Harrell said officials measured their temperatures, but only certain passengers were tested for the virus. She was cleared to fly back home to Virginia, where she was told to stay home for 14 days.   ___  Gomez Licon reported from Miami.   ___  The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

MONTREAL — The Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre says it will soon conduct the first Canadian test of a robot that uses ultraviolet light to disinfect.  The Montreal institute moved to order the robot just as the COVID-19 pandemic was emerging in China and Europe to see if the technology could be useful to Canada. A first robot arrived Monday for testing purposes.  The robot will also be tested in other Quebec locations — notably the Centre hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal and long-term care homes — before a decision is made on purchasing the $120,000 device.  \"We are going to test its mobility, if it is able to go to our rooms, in all corners, if UV light touches all parts of the room, and in addition if the robot is able to enter the bathrooms (in private rooms) and completely disinfect them,\" said Dr. Bruce Mazer, interim executive director and acting chief scientific officer of the research institute.  The robot can also be used to disinfect an operating room. As part of the test, its effectiveness will also be tested on various objects, such as sheets, stretchers and even N95 masks.  While ultraviolet C rays are able to kill pathogens on surfaces and in the air, they can be dangerous to humans.  \"The problem with UV light is that it is very effective in killing bacteria and viruses, but if you have too much UV, it can burn the skin and it can cause eye problems,\" Mazer said. \"But with this type of UV, if you close the door, even if there is a window, that doesn't happen, so it is safe.\"  The robot, built by the Danish company UVD Robots, is approximately 1.7 metres high and weighs 140 kilograms. It travels at just over 5 km/h and its battery can be fully recharged in six hours. The UV module lasts about two hours, enough to clean a dozen rooms, according to the manufacturer.  Mazer noted that manual room-cleaning takes about an hour, while the robot could do that job in about 10 minutes. A human would be required to do other tasks like changing sheets, but ultimately a room could be ready for the next patient twice as fast.  \"If we have a way of doing things with technology that is fast and efficient, we can save money, we can have rooms faster for other patients and we can avoid risks for our workers,\" Mazer said.  The robot does need guidance for the initial cleaning, but can operate on its own after that.  \"It's an automated robot controlled by GPS,\" Mazer said. \"When the robot goes to a room once, it will put it to memory and it can make up the same room the same way, whenever needed.\"  The robot is also able to spot obstacles and adjust its trajectory as necessary.  Mazer said the robot could be valuable outside the hospital.  \"It could be useful, for example, for planes or subways,\" he said. \"It could be incredible for a metro (subway) car — in fifteen minutes we could clean a whole train.\"  Mazer explained the institute deals with many different illnesses — tuberculosis, HIV and other very resistant microbes — so technology for cleaning hospitals working with patients infected with acute illnesses and a high risk of infection is key.  The Canadian Patient Safety Institute says about 8,000 Canadians die from hospital-acquired infections each year and another 220,000 are infected, which can lead to extended hospital stays or readmissions.  The Danish robot is already being used in China, Asia and Europe, and Mazer is optimistic about its potential. \"It will save lives, it will reduce waiting lists, it will reduce (hospital-acquired) infections,\" he said. \"It can be very useful.\"  This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 29, 2020.

It all just went away. It just felt like I'd been hit by a bus that came out of nowhere. It was a little scary.\"Bridges said he also contracted the virus through community-based transmission. He and Melo both emphasized the importance of continued social distancing to slow the spread.Melo said he's anxious to donate plasma to help others when he's fully recovered.\"I'm a fighter -- 20 years in the Marine Corps,\" he said. \" I have a fighting spirit in me, and I want to do anything I can to help anybody.\"Melo said he believes his wife and daughter also had the virus, but they weren't sick enough to be tested. He said he hopes it gets to the point where everyone can be tested so that more people can donate antibodies.

Email Whatsapp Menu Whatsapp Google Reddit Digg Stumbleupon Linkedin Comment  I recently wrote that practical obedience to God today is far more important than speculation about the mark of the beast tomorrow. I have also made clear that I do not believe that COVID-19 is one of the plagues from the Book of Revelation. At the same time, a number of recent developments help illustrate how quickly a false Messianic figure could emerge on the earth, in both religious and secular circles.  Prepare to read some shocking quotes. But first, let me set the stage.  As I have stated, I do not believe that a potential COVID-19 vaccine, replete with microchip is the mark of the beast. And I do not believe that the virus is part of a larger, nefarious plot hatched by a clandestine one-world government cabal. (For more on all this, see my new book.) Yet the events surrounding the coronavirus have demonstrated how quickly the status quo can be overturned, how dramatically the fortunes of nations can shift, and how a call for one-world cooperation can arise.  And what if there was a worldwide economic collapse, accompanied by plague and famine? Is it too farfetched to imagine that a powerful, problem solving leader could gain an international following?  To say it again, I do not believe we are at that point. But I do believe that, in front of our eyes, we’re seeing how quickly the table can be set, even from an entirely secular point of view.

Jesus famously warned His disciples, saying “Be careful that no one leads you astray! For many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will lead many astray.” (Matthew 24:4–5 TLV) He also warned that, “Many false prophets will arise and lead many astray.” (Matthew 24:11, TLV)  So, from a Christian perspective, before the true Messiah (= Christ) will return in the clouds of heaven, there will be counterfeit Messiahs (= antichrists) who will deceive many.  And this leads us to the promised, shocking quotes.  In the Islamic world, the belief in the Mahdi, the hidden Imam waiting to be revealed, could easily prepare the way for a counterfeit Messianic figure.  To be sure, Muslims believe that Jesus is the Messiah (although, quite plainly, they do not believe in the Jesus of the Bible). So, technically speaking, the Mahdi is not the Messiah. On the other hand, since he functions in Islamic lore as the end-time redeemer, he could be the perfect counterfeit Christ type of figure.  And here’s where it gets very interesting: there are Muslim leaders today who claim to have met the Mahdi numerous times.  Writing in the Jerusalem Post on January 20, Brian Schrauger explained that the Mahdi “is Islam’s messiah, the 12th of 12 Imams who are successors to Mohammed. Said to have been born in 879 CE, the Imam Mahdi is believed by Shi’a Muslims to still be alive, but hidden from mankind in ‘occultation’ until a time of such upheaval on the earth that only his reappearance will rescue mankind and, in fact, usher in an age of global peace; Islamic peace, that is; a kind of peace in which all mankind is living in submission to the Allah of the Koran.”  He continues, “Crazy to Western ears, this messianic creed is the raison d’être for the Islamic Republic of Iran according to its founders and leaders. It is also the basis of Tehran’s foreign and military policies; and it is impossible to overemphasize the Iran regime’s visceral commitment to it. The Imam Mahdi is invoked in every public gathering, both civil and military; he is the singular inspiration for every policy, every tactic, every mission; indeed, he is nothing less than the regime’s reason for its existence and, as such, its singular and unwavering motivation for the future.”  And Schrauger can provide documentation for every single claim he has made.  In the words of Iran’s Supreme leader Ayatollah Khamanei, “The Iranian nation, enjoys a great privilege today: the atmosphere of the country is an atmosphere of Imam Mahdi. . . .” And, Khamanei states, “many of our great scholars have personally met with this beloved [Imam] of hearts of the admirers during his occultation; many have made a pledge to him in person; many have heard from him some heartwarming words; many have been caressed by him and many others have received his kindness, care, and love.”  The Islamic Mahdi is here, he is known to many insiders, and he is about to be revealed. And remember: this article was written before Iran was smitten with COVID-19. What are the leaders thinking today?   But there’s more.  A February 20 headline in Israel Today stated that, “Israeli Rabbi Says He’s Already Holding Meetings With Messiah.” And, “Israel’s biggest rabbis are all afraid to leave the country lest they miss Messiah’s coming.”  The article, by Ryan Jones, cited a three-hour radio interview in which Rabbi Yaakov Zisholtz “told religious broadcaster Radio 2000 that Kanievsky recently told him that he (Kanievsky) is already in direct contact with the Messiah.”  Rabbi Kanievsky, now in his early 90s, is considered to be the leading authority in the ultra-Orthodox (haredi) community in Israel, and he has often spoken of the nearness of the Messiah’s coming. But it seems he is saying even more today.  According to Rabbi Zisholtz, “…the process of redemption is about to start happening very quickly and at a fast pace. It is important that people remain calm and steady to act properly in the right time.  “There is a potential Messiah in every generation and there are righteous men who know precisely who it is. This is, of course, true in this generation.  “Getting the word out now that the Messiah is closer than ever is a matter of life and death. Haven’t you heard of Gog and Magog? That is what is going to happen very soon. Right now, the situation is explosive more than you can possibly imagine. Everyone needs to know whether they are on the inside or if they are going to be left out.”  Yes, these are the words of an ultra-Orthodox rabbi in Israel, not those of an evangelical Christian, Bible in hand, with end-time prophecies heavily underlined.  While Rabbi Zisholtz was careful to say he couldn’t promise anything, he was certainly raising the bar with specific predictions and events. And again, he claimed that certain religious Jews knew exactly who the Messiah was and have even met with him.  Adding to all this was the statement of Israel’s Health Minister, Yaakov Litzman, himself ultra-Orthodox, as reported in HaAretz on March 26 and with reference to COVID-19: “We are praying and hoping that the Messiah will arrive before Passover, the time of our redemption. I am sure that the Messiah will come and bring us out as [God] brought us out of Egypt. Soon we will go out in freedom and the Messiah will come and redeem us from all the troubles of the world.”  The Messiah would be the cure to the coronavirus, and he would come (meaning, be publicly revealed, since in Jewish thought, he could already be here) by Passover.  Well, Passover ended on April 16. And, in case you missed the news, the expected Jewish Messiah did not come.  Ironically, Litzman himself contracted the virus, although he has since recovered. And for a number of reasons, including heavy criticism of his handling of the crisis, he is reportedly considering quitting.  But all this talk about the Mahdi being here, ready to be revealed, along with the traditional Jewish Messiah being here, ready to be revealed, underscores the point I have been making. It would not take much for a counterfeit Messianic figure to arise and deceive many.  And so, while I believe the table has not yet been set for this grand finale, it could clearly be set on very short notice.  Let us, then, keep our focus on the Second Coming of the true Christ (= Messiah). But let us not forget the warnings about that false Messiah (= antichrist) who will come first.

The spring semester will resume on March 23, but classes will be provided only online for a two-week period from March 23 through April 3, Baylor President Dr. Linda Livingstone said in an email to students, faculty and staff.  “We will continue to monitor the conditions around COVID-19 during this time period, and a future decision will be made as to when face-to-face instruction can resume,” she said.  Livingstone advised faculty members to prepare to teach their courses online starting March 23.  All student meetings and activities have been suspended for the next three weeks, she said.  Athletic events will continue “pending the receipt of additional guidance from the NCAA and Big 12 Conference. Enhanced cleaning and communication procedures for these events have been implemented,” she said.  Residence halls and dining facilities will be open during the next three weeks based on demands, Livingstone said.  “However we ask students to determine whether their campus or permanent residence is safest,” she said.  Libraries, the McLane Student Life Center, health and counseling services and the Bill Daniel Student Center will remain open and campus tours for prospective students and their families will continue, she said.  The school’s housekeeping services “have increased the frequency and depth of cleaning and disinfection of residence halls, dining halls, the University Libraries, McLane Student Life Center, Bill Daniel Student Center, common spaces and common contact points, such as doorknobs, elevator buttons, light switches and bathrooms,” she said.  The school is asking anyone who traveled this week domestically or internationally to areas where the new virus is widespread to follow U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and self-quarantine for 14 days.

They are:   Wash your hands  Washing your hands frequently with soap and water - or a hand sanitiser gel as an alternative - will remove viruses and bacteria from your hands.   Advertisement  \"The best thing people can do is make sure they can wash their hands for 20 seconds or more... with soap and hot water,\" Health Secretary Matt Hancock says.  He recommends telling children to wash their hands for as long as it takes to sing Happy Birthday.  England's chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, also urged the public not to touch their faces after touching bus or train handrails.  He said there is \"some risk of transmission\" from touching handrails and hard surfaces for up to 72 hours.  Medical officer coughs during cough advice  \"Just touching it will not give you the virus: it is if you touch it and then touch your face, having not washed your hands between them,\" he said.  \"So, if you go on to the Tube and touch the rail, that's fine, but just be aware of what you do with your hands - don't touch your face. Wash your hands, and then you can do what you like.\"  Prof Whitty said the droplets that lead to the COVID-19 infection would be \"largely gone\" within 48 hours in most cases.  Don't cough or sneeze into your hands  If you have a virus and you sneeze or cough into your hands, the droplets in your sneeze or cough then contaminate your hands, and you will then contaminate objects or people that you touch.  :: Listen to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker  You are advised to instead cover your mouth with a tissue or your sleeve, or to cough or sneeze into a flexed elbow.  Tissues should be discarded immediately into a closed bin and hands cleaned with soap and water or a hand sanitiser gel.  Coronavirus: How many people are at risk?   Keep your distance  Try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell.  The WHO recommends maintaining at least one metre (three feet) between yourself and other people, particularly those who are coughing, sneezing and have a fever.  If you are too close, you can breathe in the virus if an infected person coughs or sneezes.  Don't touch your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean  Your hands may touch many surfaces which can be contaminated with the virus.  If you touch your eyes, nose or mouth with your contaminated hands, you can transfer the virus from the surface to yourself.  Stay home if you feel unwell  If you experience any symptoms such as a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. The WHO advises to follow the directions of your local health authority.  Take care with animals or animal products when visiting markets  The WHO recommends regular hand washing with soap and water after touching animals and animal products when visiting markets, as well as to avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth with your hands.  They also say to avoid contact with sick animals or spoiled animal products and to avoid contact with potentially contaminated animal waste or fluids.  Avoiding consumption of raw or undercooked animal products is also recommended, as well as following good food safety practices.  However, at present, there is no evidence that pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with coronavirus.  Nevertheless, it is always a good idea to wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets to protect against common bacteria.

Does it matter where you sit on an aeroplane?  Howard Weiss, a professor of biology and mathematics at Penn State University in the US, has previously led a team to study the behaviour of passengers on flights.  His 2018 study suggested the safest place to sit on a flight was a window seat, as - if the passenger stayed put - this led to far fewer close encounters with other people than for those in other seats.  However, his team's work also revealed all passengers had a fairly low probability of getting infected with an illness.  Professor Weiss told National Geographic: \"If you're seated in an aisle seat, certainly there will be quite a few people moving past you, but they'll be moving quickly.  \"In aggregate, what we show is there's quite a low probability of transmission to any particular passenger.\"  He also highlighted how it is not yet known how coronavirus is spread.  What if you've travelled to China?  The Foreign Office is advising against all travel to China's Hubei province due to the outbreak.  They are also advising against all but essential travel to the rest of mainland China, not including Hong Kong and Macau.  If you have been to Hubei province in the last two weeks, even if you do not have symptoms, you are advised to call 111.  You are also advised to call 111 if you have been to other parts of China - including Hong Kong and Macau - or Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Republic of Korea or Malaysia in the last 14 days, and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breath, even if it's mild.  You should also call 111 if you have been in close contact with someone with confirmed coronavirus.  If any of the above applies to you, do not go to a GP surgery or hospital.

Also, the Department of Juvenile Justice announced Sunday that an employee at a South Florida juvenile-justice facility had tested positive. The facility is operated by a contractor.  If state workers need to miss work to self-isolate due to COVID-19 exposure, they can use accrued paid time off, whether it be annual, sick, or personal leave.  DeSantis has also directed state agencies to allow employees to donate paid time off to colleagues who run out of paid leave as a result of COVID-19.  “The employee requesting to use donated leave must exhaust all accrued personal leave and have a documented/legitimate reason(s) regarding COVID-19 to be absent from their work location,” officials wrote to state workers in a memo obtained by The News Service of Florida.

The latest reading pointed to the sharpest deterioration in business conditions across the sector since data collection began over 15 years ago.  Commenting on the latest survey results, Eliot Kerr, Economist at IHS Markit, said: \"After making it through March relatively unscathed, the Indian manufacturing sector felt the full force of the coronavirus pandemic in April.\"In the latest survey period, record contractions in output, new orders and employment pointed to a severe deterioration in demand conditions. Meanwhile, there was evidence of unprecedented supply-side disruption, with input delivery times lengthening to the greatest extent since data collection began in March 2005.\"There was a hint of positivity when looking at firms' 12-month outlooks, with sentiment towards future activity rebounding from March's record low. That said, the degree of optimism remained well below the historical average.\"   Stocks in Spotlight :  Shares of auto manufacturers tumbled after weak auto sales in April 2020.

Global Markets:  Overseas, Asian stocks were trading lower as US-China tensions weigh on investor sentiment. Markets in China, Japan and Thailand are closed on Monday for holidays.  In the US, Wall Street sold off sharply on Friday after President Donald Trump revived a threat of new tariffs against China in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has brought global economies to a grinding halt.  The US President announced that his administration was crafting retaliatory measures against China as punishment for the coronavirus outbreak, giving rise to tariff fears that rattled markets through much of the last two years. Trump has reportedly blamed the Asian major for what he says is misinformation when the virus emerged from the Chinese city of Wuhan and then quickly spread around the world.  A mixed bag of earnings, particularly a disappointing report from Amazon.com, along with a fresh round of dismal economic data, also weighed on sentiment.  While Amazon.com expressed the possibility of the company reporting its first quarterly loss in five years due to the coronavirus pandemic, Apple Inc declined to provide current-quarter forecasts despite the iPhone maker posting good quarterly result.  Shares of Tesla tumbled over 10% after company Chief Executive Elon Musk said in a tweet that the electric car maker's stock price was too high.  U.S. manufacturing activity skidded to an 11-year low last month as lockdowns shuttered factories, according to the Institute for Supply Management's purchasing managers index.

US President Donald Trump is allegedly furious about the plunge on global financial markets caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus, The Washington Post reported citing two anonymous sources close to the president. The newspaper said Trump is highly concerned about the situation on stock markets and advised his aides against making forecasts on the disease fearing this may lead to more uncertainty and further destabilise markets.

The pandemic sweeping the globe has done more than take lives and livelihoods from New Delhi to New York. It is shaking fundamental assumptions about American exceptionalism — the special role the United States played for decades after World War II as the reach of its values and power made it a global leader and example to the world.  Today it is leading in a different way: More than 840,000 Americans have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and at least 46,784 have died from it, more than anywhere else in the world.  As the calamity unfolds, President Donald Trump and state governors are not only arguing over what to do but also over who has the authority to do it. Trump has fomented protests against the safety measures urged by scientific advisers, misrepresented facts about the virus and the government response nearly daily, and this week used the virus to cut off the issuing of green cards to people seeking to emigrate to the United States.  “America has not done badly; it has done exceptionally badly,” said Dominique Moïsi, a political scientist and senior adviser at the Paris-based Institut Montaigne.  FILE - Health care workers collect samples at a drive-thru coronavirus testing site in Paramus, N.J., April 7, 2020. The coronavirus pandemic is shaking fundamental assumptions about American exceptionalism — the special role the US played for decades after World War II as the reach of its values and power made it a global leader and example to the world, but today it is leading in a different way: Some 800,000 Americans have been diagnosed with Covid-19 and at least 42,094 have died, more than anywhere else in the world. (Ryan Christopher Jones/The New York Times)  The pandemic has exposed the strengths and weaknesses of just about every society, Moïsi noted. It has demonstrated the strength of, and suppression of information by, an authoritarian Chinese state as it imposed a lockdown in the city of Wuhan. It has shown the value of Germany’s deep well of public trust and collective spirit, even as it has underscored the country’s reluctance to step up forcefully and lead Europe.  And in the United States, it has exposed two great weaknesses that, in the eyes of many Europeans, have compounded one another: the erratic leadership of Trump, who has devalued expertise and often refused to follow the advice of his scientific advisers, and the absence of a robust public health care system and social safety net.  “America prepared for the wrong kind of war,” Moïsi said. “It prepared for a new 9/11, but instead a virus came.”  “It raises the question: Has America become the wrong kind of power with the wrong kind of priorities?” he asked.  Ever since Trump moved into the White House and turned America First into his administration’s guiding mantra, Europeans have had to get used to the president’s casual willingness to risk decades-old alliances and rip up international agreements. Early on, he called NATO “obsolete” and withdrew US support from the Paris climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal.  But this is perhaps the first global crisis in more than a century where no one is even looking to the United States for leadership.  In Berlin, Germany’s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, has said as much.  China took “very authoritarian measures, while in the US, the virus was played down for a long time,” Maas recently told Der Spiegel magazine.  “These are two extremes, neither of which can be a model for Europe,” Maas said.  America once told a story of hope, and not just to Americans. West Germans like Maas, who grew up on the front line of the Cold War, knew that story by heart, and like many others in the world, believed it.  But nearly three decades later, America’s story is in trouble.  The country that defeated fascism in Europe 75 years ago next month, and defended democracy on the continent in the decades that followed, is doing a worse job of protecting its own citizens than many autocracies and democracies.  FILE - Checkpoint Charlie, once a crossing point between East Berlin and West Berlin, March 16, 2020.

(Emile Ducke/The New York Times)  There is a special irony: Germany and South Korea, both products of enlightened postwar US leadership, have become potent examples of best practices in the coronavirus crisis.  But critics now see America failing not only to lead the world’s response but also letting down its own people as well.  “There is not only no global leadership, there is no national and no federal leadership in the United States,” said Ricardo Hausmann, director of the Growth Lab at Harvard’s Center for International Development. “In some sense this is the failure of leadership of the US in the US”  Of course, some countries in Europe have also been overwhelmed by the virus, with the number of dead from COVID-19 much higher as a percentage of the population in Italy, Spain and France than in the United States. But they were struck sooner and had less time to prepare and react.  The contrast between how the United States and Germany responded to the virus is particularly striking.  While Chancellor Angela Merkel has been criticised for not taking a forceful enough leadership role in Europe, Germany is being praised for a near-textbook response to the pandemic, at least by Western standards. That is thanks to a robust public health care system, but also a strategy of mass testing and trusted and effective political leadership.  Merkel has done what Trump has not. She has been clear and honest about the risks with voters and swift in her response. She has rallied all 16 state governors behind her. A trained physicist, she has followed scientific advice and learned from best practice elsewhere.  Not long ago, Merkel was considered a spent force, having announced that this would be her last term. Now her approval ratings are at 80%.  “She has the mind of a scientist and the heart of a pastor’s daughter,” Garton Ash said.  Trump, in a hurry to restart the economy in an election year, has appointed a panel of business executives to chart a course out of the lockdown.  Merkel, like everyone, would like to find a way out, too, but this week she warned Germans to remain cautious. She is listening to the advice of a multidisciplinary panel of 26 academics from Germany’s national academy of science. The panel includes not just medical experts and economists but also behavioural psychologists, education experts, sociologists, philosophers and constitutional experts.  “You need a holistic approach to this crisis,” said Gerald Haug, the academy’s president, who chairs the German panel. “Our politicians get that.”  A climatologist, Haug used to do research at Columbia University in New York.  The United States has some of the world’s best and brightest minds in science, he said. “The difference is, they’re not being listened to.”  “It’s a tragedy,” he added.

(Laetitia Vancon/The New York Times)  Some cautioned that the final history of how countries fare after the pandemic is still a long way from being written.  A pandemic is a very specific kind of stress test for political systems, said Garton Ash, the history professor. The military balance of power has not shifted at all. The United States remains the world’s largest economy. And it was entirely unclear what global region would be best equipped to kick-start growth after a deep recession.  “All of our economies are going to face a terrible test,” he said. “No one knows who will come out stronger at the end.”  Benjamin Haddad, a French researcher at the Atlantic Council, wrote that while the pandemic was testing US leadership, it is “too soon to tell” if it would do long-term damage.  “It is possible that the United States will resort to unexpected resources, and at the same time find a form of national unity in its foreign policy regarding the strategic rivalry with China, which it has been lacking until now,” Haddad wrote.  There is another wild card in the short term, Moïsi pointed out. The United States has an election in November. That, and the aftermath of the deepest economic crisis since the 1930s, might also affect the course of history.  The Great Depression gave rise to America’s New Deal. Maybe the coronavirus will lead the United States to embrace a stronger public safety net and develop a national consensus for more accessible health care, Moïsi suggested.  “Europe’s social democratic systems are not only more human, they leave us better prepared and fit to deal with a crisis like this than the more brutal capitalistic system in the United States,” Moïsi said.  The current crisis, some fear, could act like an accelerator of history, speeding up a decline in influence of both the United States and Europe.  “Sometime in 2021 we come out of this crisis and we will be in 2030,” Moïsi said. “There will be more Asia in the world and less West.”  Garton Ash said that the United States should take an urgent warning from a long line of empires that rose and fell.  “To a historian it’s nothing new, that’s what happens,” Garton Ash said. “It’s a very familiar story in world history that after a certain amount of time a power declines.”  “You accumulate problems, and because you’re such a strong player, you can carry these dysfunctionalities for a long time,” he said. “Until something happens and you can’t anymore.”  ©2020 The New York Times Company  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 33, "positive": 65, "negative": 33, "sadness": 1, "disgust": 2, "joy": 11, "anger": 8, "surprise": 4, "fear": 21, "trust": 14}, "metadata": ["university", "focused", "professor", "european", "oxford", "pandemic", "delhi", "united", "global", "americans", "diagnosed", "donald", "trump", "arguing", "protests", "scientific", "virus", "scientist", "samples", "coronavirus", "strength", "chinese", "lockdown", "america", "willingness", "climate", "iran", "crisis", "china", "germany", "spain", "france", "risks", "economy", "columbia", "antibodies", "french", "economic"]}, {"text": "FREE now SUBSCRIBE Invalid email Make the most of your money by signing up to our newsletter fornow We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon faces a crisis after a report by Oil and Gas UK (OGUK) found 30,000 offshore workers could be out of work after the price of Brent crude dropped to 20-year lows in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. The OGUK warned jobs be lost in the next 12 to 18 months if the industry does not have help to \"weather this storm\".  The news is a massive blow for Scotland, which relies heavily on oil revenue to prop up its economy. Scotland possesses 96 percent of the UK’s crude oil and 63 percent of natural gas production. Ms Sturgeon had pinned her independence hopes on being able to secure sole ownership of the oil fields, which sit in the UK’s territorial waters, to underpin the Scottish economy with the support of the Union.  The North Sea could be brought to its knees  The North Sea oil and gas industry faces a 'bleak future'  OGUK chief executive Deirdre Michie said: \"Like so many industries, our members have been profoundly impacted by Covid-19. \"With historic low oil and gas prices coming so soon after one of the most severe downturns our sector has experienced, these findings confirm an especially bleak outlook for the UK's oil and gas industry.

Congress provided $100 billion for the health care system in the $2 trillion stimulus bill.  Officials say the relief funds will go to hospitals and doctors through Medicare and will be based on their billings to the program last year. Hospitals are supposed to use some of the money to cover COVID-19 treatment for the uninsured, although an independent study earlier this week suggests it may not be enough.

The crash took place after he returned from a trip to Florida for his bachelor party.  His group had travelled on a private plane and Muzzo has previously said he had up to four drinks during the flight and had been drinking until 3 a.m. the night before.  He picked up his car at Toronto's Pearson International Airport and drove through a stop sign while speeding, T-boning the minivan carrying the Neville-Lake family, his court case heard.  Muzzo, who was held at the Beaver Creek Institution in Gravenhurst, Ont., unsuccessfully sought parole in the fall of 2018.  At the time, the parole board panel said he showed a lack of insight into his drinking habits and the risk they pose to others.  The case continues to draw widespread attention and has spurred multiple petitions over the years from those opposed to his release.  Tuesday's hearing was nonetheless closed to observers, including media, due to physical distancing restrictions related to COVID-19.  The parole board said it has enhanced its technology to allow remote participation in hearings but those efforts are focused on victims, their support persons and offenders' assistants.

The Commissioner of Police in the State, E. Ene Okon who confirmed this to newsmen said the operation was carried out by operatives of State Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).

That dedication appears to have cost him his life, with Wuhan's health bureau announcing Tuesday that he became infected and died despite “all-out\" attempts to save him.  Liu is at least the seventh health worker to die of the COVID-19 disease among the more than 1,700 doctors and nurses who have become sick. His death comes as authorities are cautiously cheering a reduction in the number of new daily cases and deaths, along with the results of a study showing most people who contracted the virus experienced only mild symptoms.  China on Tuesday reported 1,886 new cases and 98 more deaths. That raised the number of deaths in mainland China to 1,868 and the total number of confirmed cases to 72,436.  “Now the prevention and control work is at a critical time,” President Xi Jinping told British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a phone call Tuesday, according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.   Confirmed Coronavirus Cases  Japan, meanwhile, announced that 88 more cases of the virus were confirmed aboard a quarantined cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, bringing the total to 542 among the 3,700 initially on board.  The U.N. secretary general told The Associated Pres that the virus outbreak “is not out of control but it is a very dangerous situation.”  Antonio Guterres said in an interview in Lahore, Pakistan, that “the risks are enormous and we need to be prepared worldwide for that.”  The outbreak has caused massive disruptions and China may postpone its biggest political meeting of the year to avoid having people travel to Beijing while the virus is still spreading. One of the automotive industry's biggest events, China's biannual auto show, also is being postponed, and many sports and entertainment events have been delayed or canceled.  Despite strict rules on use of masks and safety suits, medical workers have been prominent among the victims, particularly in the early stage of the outbreak.  In announcing Liu's death, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said he had taken part in the battle against the virus from the start and had made “important contributions in the work of fighting and controlling\" the virus.  During that process, \"unfortunately he became infected and passed away at 10:54 Tuesday morning at the age of 51 after all-out efforts to save him failed,\" the commission said.  As coronavirus continues to spread, lawmakers question why the Trump administration has not asked for emergency funds to fight the deadly disease, and instead proposed cuts to the Centers for Disease Control budget. NBC's Tracie Potts reports.  The Hubei native had graduated from Wuhan University's School of Medicine in 1991 and went on to a career as a chief physician, neurosurgeon and administrator.  Earlier this month, public outrage was stirred by the death from the virus of Wuhan doctor Li Wenliang, who had been threatened by police after releasing word of an outbreak of an unusual respiratory illness in December before it had spread widely and the city was placed under quarantine.  Wuhan and its surrounding cities in Hubei province have accounted for the vast majority of infections and deaths, prompting the government to enforce a travel ban that has spread to other parts of the country and now includes a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine period for anyone traveling outside their home district. Two new prefabricated hospitals have been built to deal with the overflow in Wuhan and thousands of medical staff have been brought in from other parts of the country to help.  A study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention found more than 80% of the cases studied were mild and the number of new infections seemed to be falling since early this month. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was too early to know if the reported decline would continue, however. \"Every scenario is still on the table,\" he said at a news conference.  The seeming drop in the number of new cases follows a large spike last week after Hubei province began counting cases by doctors' diagnoses without waiting for laboratory test results. Health authorities there said the change was meant to get patients treated faster.  Regular surgical face masks are not effective in protecting against the coronavirus. A more specialized face mask known as N95 respirators are thicker than surgical masks and are fitted to a person’s face to keep out any viral particles.  The Chinese study examined 44,672 cases of the disease that were confirmed in the mainland as of Feb. 11. Severe symptoms such as pneumonia occurred in 14% of them and critical illness in 5%. The fatality rate was 2.3% — 2.8% for males versus 1.7% for females.  The death rate is lower than for SARS and MERS, diseases caused by coronaviruses related to the one that causes COVID-19. But the new virus ultimately could prove more deadly if it spreads to far more people than the others did. The COVID-19 cases include relatively few children, and the risk of death rises with age or other health problems and was higher in Hubei province versus elsewhere in China.  The study warned that while cases seem to have been declining since Feb. 1, that could change as people return to work and school after the Lunar New Year holidays, typically the biggest travel period for Chinese travelers. Beijing and other governments have sought to forestall that by extending the holiday break, encouraging telecommuting and self-quarantines and conducting health checks on travelers.  Travel to and from the worst-hit central China region was associated with the initial cases of COVID-19 confirmed abroad. But Japan, Singapore and South Korea have identified new cases without clear ties to China or previously known patients, raising concern of the virus spreading locally.  A non-profit based in Centennial, Colorado, is sending desperately needed medical supplies to doctors treating coronavirus patients in Wuhan, China.The shipments include supplies like personal protective equipment, including masks and gloves. First shipments are directed for doctors and nurses.  The largest number of cases outside China is the 542 among passengers and crew of the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined at a port near Tokyo. The infections have led to heavy criticism of the decision to quarantine passengers on the vessel.  The U.S. evacuated 328 American passengers, with most of them placed in a 14-day quarantine at military bases in California and Texas. Thirteen who tested positive for the virus were taken to a hospital in Omaha, Nebraska, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said any more passengers who show symptoms will be taken to hospitals.   ___  Associated Press writers Maria Cheng in London and Marilynn Marchione, David Pitt, Olga R.

'This is my Dad,' she wrote in the caption of the photo, a black-and-white shot that shows Dr. Fisher, who is a former astronaut, standing in the ER while wearing a surgical mask and gloves. 'He’s a 73 year old Emergency Room physician in Texas who loves his job and will never retire.  Heartbreaking: Fox News correspondent Kristin Fisher shared this image of her 73-year-old ER doctor father while sharing her fears about him working with coronavirus patients  Devastating: The 36-year-old confessed that she broke down in tears when she saw the photo of her father wearing a medical mask and gloves  'He texted me this picture tonight after I’d asked him how he was doing... and I burst into tears the second I saw it.  'My reaction came out of nowhere. I’d been watching Narcos and laughing seconds earlier.  'I called him to say I was worried about him, but could barely speak as I fought to keep my voice steady. I think we all have a moment where the gravity of what’s happening finally hits us. This was mine.'  The post quickly went viral, with thousands of people liking and sharing Kristin's tweet, while hundreds offered words of sympathy and support.  'Praying for your dad and thank you for what you do. It's people like him that'll get us through this,' one person wrote, while another said: 'Your father is a hero, Kristin! At his age and facing a virus that puts him at high risk, nobody would think twice about it if he decided to retire.  'Instead he's gearing up and wading into the trenches to help his fellow Americans. You should be, and I'm sure you are, so proud!'  Others shared stories about their own families and the difficulties that they are facing during the coronavirus pandemic.  Upset: 'I called him to say I was worried about him, but could barely speak as I fought to keep my voice steady,' Kristin said of her former astronaut father  Proud: Both of Kristin's parents worked for NASA during the 80s, and her father went into space on the 1985 shuttle  Emotional: 'I think we all have a moment where the gravity of what’s happening finally hits us. This was mine,' Kristin, pictured with her parents last year, said of receiving her dad's photo  'My daughter is in charge of a large clinic,' one wrote. 'She has two kids...I begged her to find a way to quarantine. She said, “Mom, I’m a nurse...my staff are on the front line...I would never abandon them or our patients!”  'Ppl she’s the norm, not the exception! True American heroes!'  Another person added: 'I had a similar reaction hearing my mother talk to her 100 year old mother on the phone. My grandmother is in a nursing home. They are on lockdown. She has a birthday 19 March 2020. We will not see her.'  As of Thursday afternoon there were more than 11,300 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US, with more than 220 located in Texas, where three people are k known to have died as a result of the illness.  Following the overwhelming response to Kristin's tweet, the TV correspondent and her father appeared on Fox News on Wednesday to discuss the incredible reaction, while Dr. Fisher also shared some insight into what life has been like working in the ER during the coronavirus pandemic.  The medical professional - who is a former NASA astronaut who went into space on the 1985 space shuttle - explained that, while he knows he is working under increased risk, he is determined to do the best job he can.  'All health care workers are at increased risk, but we do the best we can, and every patient that I see with similar symptoms is a potential COVID-19 patient, so we have to treat everybody as though they are infected ... and that is what we are doing,' he said.  Speaking about the overwhelming pressure he and his team is facing, Dr. Fisher compared his work to 'walking into a dark forest with a patient behind every tree'.  Speaking out: Kristin and her father, Dr. Fisher, went on Fox News together to discuss the viral response to the image  Scary: Dr. Fisher compared working in the ER to 'walking into a dark forest with a patient behind every tree'  Family first: The mother-of-one is based in Washington, where she lives with her husband and their young son, who watched his mom and grandfather on TV  But despite the uncertainty and the terrifying prospect of working in such risky conditions, Dr. Fisher was full of praise for the way that the government has handled the pandemic, insisting that officials had done a 'remarkable' job of responding to the crisis, despite his hospital not yet receiving any coronavirus tests.  'The way we have transitioned from a peacetime to a wartime setting in the last two weeks has been remarkable,' he said.  'It took four to six months to get this far after Pearl Harbor. I think an excellent job is being done, it's just the magnitude of the problem is so great, it takes time.'  As for the reaction to his daughter's post, Dr. Fisher admitted that he was stunned after reading her kind words.  'When I read what she said, I teared up, too,' he said. 'I was so surprised. It was such a wonderful thing to read.'  Appearing with her father on the show, Kristin confessed that, while she supports her father and knows that he is in good health, hearing all of the news about the risks that healthcare workers are facing is making her more and more worried for him.  'I know he is the youngest 73-year-old in the world,' she said.  'He has the immune system of somebody who has been working in emergency rooms for 40-plus years, but when you hear the stats about how this virus affects people who are older, it really hit me.'

Trump launched an attack on governors saying that “some of them are being unreasonable” in their management of the coronavirus pandemic. At a White House briefing on Saturday, Trump said: “There are a lot of protests out there, and I just think that some of the governors have gotten carried away.”  The claims come as protests against the stifling lockdown restrictions are starting to spread across the US. In Austin, Texas, where more than one million people have filed unemployment claims since the start of the pandemic, hundreds of protestors gathered on Saturday demanding: “Let us work!”. The rally was organised by a host of Infowars, owned by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who arrived to the Capitol steps in a tank-like truck.

Dr. Shi Zhengli then moved to Wuhan, China.  Today we have proof that the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where Dr. Shi worked was busy experimenting on live animals!  We’ve located a picture of Dr. Shi at the Wuhan Institute of Virology working in the lab:   Via Yaacov Apelbaum  TRENDING: \"Georgia Is the First State I'm Going to Blow Up and Mr. Kemp and the Secretary of State Need to Go With It!\" -- Sidney Powell Releases the Kraken! (VIDEO)  In addition, we’ve identified lab workers experimenting with live animals!  As we reported yesterday, Doctor Shi Zhengli worked with Doctor Ralph S. Baric, and together with others, they published an article in a 2015 edition of Nature Medicine. In the article they discussed bat coronaviruses that showed potential for human emergence. The article was published in 2015.  This report was published shortly after their project was defunded by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The HHS in 2014 sent a letter to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where they announced they were going to defund the program.  Dr. Ralph S. Baric was identified in the letter.  After the work stopped in the US, the Chinese moved forward with the project and ran research and development in Wuhan. From Shi Zhengli’s papers and resume, it is clear that they successfully isolated the virus in the lab and were actively experimenting with specie specie transmission.  It’s also important to note that back in 2017 we had solid intelligence about a viral leak in a high security Chinese virology R&D center that resulted in the SARS virus getting out and killing people.  This information provides a basis that contradicts the theory that COVID-19 is a variant that just magically mutated in a bat in the wild and then jumped to a human when they ate a delicious bowl of bat soup.  From all of the published research papers that relate to this project going back to 2014, it’s clear that COVID-19 was already in a lab. It’s difficult to tell if the release was intentional or accidental.  In 2017, the Chinese had a similar release incident that sickened eight people and killed one. It started when two workers at a Chinese CDC lab independently isolated and experimented in vitro/vivo a SARS virus. In one of these sessions the scientists took a previously unknown variant of the SARS virus and moved it out from a BSL-4 high-containment facility into a low-safety diarrhea research lab where the two were working. Apparently, the virus inactivation process didn’t work properly and both were infected at the lab and then proceeded to infect other people outside of the lab.  Two days ago we noted that the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China was hiring individuals for an ecological study of bat migration and virus transmission in November of 2019.  We now know from Dr. Shi’s resume and papers that she was still working on the coronavirus at that time:   Via Yaacov Apelbaum.  According to National Review, on December 24, 2019, the Wuhan Institute of Virology posted a second job posting.  We now know that the researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were experimenting with live animals and working on the China coronavirus in a lab in Wuhan for years.

Tom Wolf on Monday set May 8 as the date he wants to begin easing some pandemic restrictions, saying Pennsylvania had made sufficient progress against COVID-19 to warrant a gradual reopening of the economy.  All 12.8 million Pennsylvanians will have to stay home at least through that date, said Wolf, extending his existing stay-at-home order by another eight days. But he suggested it might then be lifted areas of the state where the new coronavirus - which has killed more than 1,200 Pennsylvania residents - does not pose as great of a threat.  Pennsylvania will also ease some restrictions on building construction and vehicle sales, Wolf announced at a video news conference as hundreds of protesters, defying a ban on mass gatherings, staged an anti-shutdown rally at the Capitol.  “We are taking small steps toward regaining a degree of normalcy in Pennsylvania,” Wolf said. He suggested that more businesses might be allowed to reopen in early May if Pennsylvania continues to make gains in its fight against the virus.  As Wolf spoke, flag-waving protesters - some with masks, some without - ignored social distancing guidelines to call on him to end the shutdown of businesses deemed nonessential and to get nearly 1.4 million unemployed Pennsylvanians back to work. Other protesters drove around the block, horns blaring.  Kevin Depaulis, 55, a salesman in York Springs who expects to lose 40% of his income this year, said he was rallying to “end this nonsense,” adding that it should be up to local leaders to decide whether it’s safe for businesses to reopen.  Some GOP lawmakers also attended the protest, which was organized and promoted by several groups that recently popped up on Facebook, including one connected to an obscure gun-rights organization. Police were there in force but allowed the rally to go off as planned. It was one of several similar protests in state capitals around the nation.  Meanwhile, both chambers of the GOP-controlled state Legislature returned to session Monday, as Republicans push legislation that would take away some of Wolf‘s power to determine which businesses must remain closed during the pandemic. Wolf, a Democrat, has said he will veto one bill sent to him last week and another that is expected to win House passage as early as Monday.  Wolf has said he would rely on an “evidence-based, regional approach” guided by health experts and economists that will help him decide when it’s safe to reopen.  On Monday he signed online-notary legislation that will pave the way for online vehicle sales. Limited building construction work may resume on May 8, he said. More industry sectors might be opened by then, depending on the availability of virus testing and the capacity of the health care system, Wolf said.  Other coronavirus-related developments in Pennsylvania:   BUSINESS PROTOCOLS  Many commercial buildings that serve the public are now required to make sure customers wear masks - and deny entry to anyone who refuses without a medically valid reason - under an order signed last week by Wolf‘s health secretary.  The order, which took effect Sunday night, is meant to protect critical workers who can’t stay home and are at heightened risk of contracting the new coronavirus, Wolf has said.  Workers at places including supermarkets, home improvement centers, warehouses, manufacturing facilities and other businesses that remain open during the pandemic also must wear a mask.  The mask mandate was included in a wide-ranging order that governs many aspects of how a business operates, from how it arranges its break room to how many patrons it can allow inside at any one time.  Business owners and managers who discover an exposure to someone who is infected must follow certain protocols, including deep cleaning of the premises and temperature checks of employees before they enter. Employees must be sent home if they have a temperature of 100.4 degrees or higher.  Wolf previously closed schools and businesses deemed nonessential, and ordered residents to stay home unless making a trip related to health, safety or some other life necessity.   ___  LIQUOR STORES BEGIN CURBSIDE PICKUP  The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board began telephone orders by curbside pickup at more than 175 of the state’s 600 stores Monday. Each customer is limited to no more than six bottles.  The move follows Wolf’s unpopular closure of the state-owned liquor stores. The state’s online ordering system has been unable to keep up with overwhelming consumer demand.  The liquor board, which has a virtual monopoly on retail sales of hard alcohol in Pennsylvania, has been repurposing some of the stores to help fulfill online orders.  Under the curbside pickup program, each store will take orders by phone from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. - or until it reaches the maximum orders it can fill that day - Monday through Saturday.  Producers, breweries, wineries and distilleries, and privately owned beer distributorships have been permitted to sell during the business shutdown. Beer and wine is also available at grocery stores and convenience stores.   ___   CASES  Pennsylvania’s COVID-19 death toll rose by 92 to 1,204, the state health department reported Monday, with nearly 950 additional people testing positive for the new coronavirus.  It was the first time since April 1 that health officials reported fewer than 1,000 new virus cases, a sign the pandemic’s grip might be easing. Health officials have said that social distancing measures have worked to slow the virus’s spread.  Statewide, more than 33,200 people have tested positive, according to the latest health department statistics.  The virus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people but more severe illness for some, including older adults and people with existing health problems.   ___   REMOTE MEETINGS LAW  Wolf signed a bill Monday that permits municipalities to hold hearings, meetings and other business remotely, through telecommunications devices, for the duration of the COVID-19 emergency.  To the extent possible, political subdivisions should provide advance notice of such meetings on their websites or in local newspapers, and tell the public how to monitor them. The governmental bodies are supposed to provide a means of getting public feedback, including mailed comments.   ___  Rubinkam reported from northeastern Pennsylvania.

The district’s general manager says the increases are necessary to help pay for critical upgrades to aging infrastructure, new equipment needed to keep up with the anticipated tightening of environmental regulations, and rising operating costs, including salaries and benefits.  The district’s board of directors will decide on whether to approve the rate increases on May 11.  If the rates are approved, the annual sewer bill for a single-family home would increase on July 1 to $454.57, from the current rate of $421.37, a nearly 8 percent increase.  Each year after, rates would increase at a similar pace, with annual bills costing homeowners $611.58 by July 2025, according to the district.  Owners of multi-family properties like apartment or condominium complexes will be facing a 47.5 percent increase over the same time frame, according to district figures. Current annual bills are $365.32 per unit, and by July 2025, they would increase to $538.95.  Paul Eldredge, the district’s general manager, said most of the district’s facilities are decades old and need to be upgraded or replaced.  A district analysis projects about $644 million worth of needed upgrades over the next decade across the district’s facilities, which include a 33-acre treatment plant at the western edge of Union City, nearly 840 miles of sewer lines, and pump stations.  “We’ve got several pump stations that pump all the sewage from Union City, Fremont, and Newark to our treatment plant that need to be rehabbed in some form or fashion in the next three to six years. And each pump station…you’re looking at anywhere between $12 to $20 million,” Eldredge said in an interview Thursday.  Eldredge said various tanks at the treatment plant haven’t been upgraded since 1993, and need replacement because of the corrosive and caustic nature of the sewage they process.  Since 2001, the district has never raised rates more than 6.5 percent in a single year, according to district figures provided to this news organization, and Eldredge said the average annual increases have typically been around 4 percent in that time frame.  He said just over half of the current proposed increases would go toward the infrastructure upgrades.  Eldredge also said the district needs to add new equipment, as regulators have signaled they’ll soon require sewer agencies to cut down on the amount of ammonia, nitrogen, and phosphorus that naturally occur in human waste and other sewage before treated wastewater can be pumped into the Bay.  The district currently spends around $20 million of its $77 million annual total budget on infrastructure improvement projects, and nearly $7 million more for debt service and initial studies for those improvements, Eldredge said.  While infrastructure upgrades account for a bit more than half of the proposed increases, the remainder of the increases would go toward operating costs, such as salaries and benefits for the district’s 137 employees, power, and chemicals.  Eldredge said district current staffing levels are lean, as they’ve left a few open positions vacant, and he said no employees can be cut to save more money.  “We really don’t have the ability to reduce headcount because we need the staff that we have to keep the plant operating,” he said. “We don’t have excess staff sitting around doing nothing.”  The district this year has spent about $5.4 million on pensions and benefits, including approximately $3.2 million to help pay down a $46.7 million unfunded pension liability.  Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, which has rocked the national economy and forced millions into unemployment, Eldredge said these upgrades are necessary, and a district analysis estimates that construction costs would only increase if the district waited to make the changes.  “The district is very sensitive to everything that is going on right now. We know there are so many things to be worrying about. An increase to wastewater service is going to add to that worry, and we do not take that lightly,” he said.  “Any delay would result in higher cost to the customers,” he said.  Even as the general construction market is hit hard by the pandemic, Eldredge said only a smaller group of contractors are available to do the kind of specialized municipal jobs the district needs, so the cost of construction could still increase even as other kinds of construction slow down.  So far, he said, the district has not found any kind of emergency funding from the state or federal governments to use for upgrades during the pandemic, which could potentially help delay the proposed rate increases.  “We realize that no one likes a rate increase under any circumstances, and especially now, probably even more so,” Eldredge said.  “However, we do believe it is the most fiscally prudent option as far as looking at today and tomorrow when it comes to the rates ratepayers pay.” .  Anyone in the service area can protest the rate increase by sending an email to rates@unionsanitary.ca.gov, or by calling the district at 510-477-7500. Protests must include the property owner’s name, the street address or assessor’s parcel number, the district said.  The board meeting where the rates will be voted on is scheduled for 7 p.m. on May 11, and due to the coronavirus pandemic, will be conducted via teleconference. The district will provide a link on the upcoming meeting agenda for the public to listen into the meeting online, and a phone number to call and listen.  When posted, the agenda and meeting information can be found on the district website.

The big, art-deco hotel in midtown Manhattan is one of several across the U.S. that have become barracks for an army of health care workers deployed to fight COVID-19.  “You come home, get your dinner, take a shower, get to sleep and then do it all over again the next day,” said physician assistant Shadoe Daniels, through his mask, in a ballroom converted into an intake area, where shoe sanitizing stations are a must-stop before guests head to the elevators.  The Honesdale, Pennsylvania, resident likened his workday to “going to war.”  More than 15,000 of the nation’s 56,000 hotels and motels are now offering rooms for emergency and health care workers, according to Chip Rogers, president of the American Hotel and Lodging Association.  Some health care workers have snagged free rooms at the Sophy Hyde Park hotel in Chicago or the luxurious Four Seasons Hotel New York.  Others, like Daniels, are being put up by staffing agencies hired to quickly bring reinforcements to overwhelmed hospitals.  At another time, hotels packed with out-of-town workers on a shared mission might have been buzzing like a college dorm, with nurses or doctors sharing drinks at the bar after shifts or heading out to a Broadway show.  But several healthcare workers staying at The New Yorker told The Associated Press that they are too exhausted after 12-hour workdays to do much more than shower, eat, exercise, read and sleep. Shuttered bars, restaurants and businesses limit options.  Zuri Longoria, a nurse from Aransas Pass, Texas, said she relieves stress from tending to dying patients by chatting with other medical volunteers like herself.  “You can’t share that type of bond with anybody else,” Longoria said.  In the hotel's ballroom, sanitizing materials rest on a table and prayer cards and handwritten well wishes from the community hang from a bulletin board. “Thank you for helping others in their time of need!\" reads one.  Öne note acknowledged how inadequate words, prayers and small contributions seemed for the workers. “It's not a lot and way less than you guys deserve! Please be safe!\" it said.  Nathan Shapiro-Shellaby, a nurse anesthetist from Seattle, said he runs outdoors and meditates before boarding a shuttle bus for work at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, which has been ground zero for the crisis.  After work, he's sharpening his Facetime and Zoom skills to maintain relationships.  “That’s been one of my favorite things to do to kind of release stress and hear about family and friends from all around the world,\" Shapiro-Shellaby said.  Daniels said immediately after a shift he sanitizes his shoes, wipes down anything he carries with Clorox wipes and drops his clothing in a laundry bag at his room.  “Then I jump right in the shower. My bedroom is like COVID-free, as much as it can be,\" Daniels said.  Daniels, Longoria and Shapiro-Shellaby were recruited to New York by Krucial Staffing, which advertised that three-week stints for 400 nurses starting in mid-April would pay $10,000 per week.  Two weeks ago, the Mariott hotel chain announced it would provide $10 million of free “Rooms for Responders” in New York City, New Orleans, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Washington, D.C. and Newark, New Jersey. In less than two days, 6,200 nights in rooms had been booked, with 53% of them in the New York area and 34% in Los Angeles.  Hilton and American Express also teamed up to donate up to 1 million hotel room nights nationwide.  Rogers estimates that half of the hotels in the country are closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. And most of the rest are operating with skeletal staffs.  Hotel authorities say most hotels still up and running are housing workers, while some have offered space for hospital operations or to provide rooms for the homeless or quarantined individuals.  “It’s a win, win, win,” said Kim Sabow, president of the Arizona Lodging and Tourism Association. She said 300 Arizona hotels had volunteered to house medical workers. “This is just a wonderful way in which the hotels can keep their doors open and give back at this horrific time of crisis.”  Some hotels volunteered after California’s governor threatened to use the powers of the state to take over hotels.  “Hotels were rightfully concerned. At the same time, we had already heard hotels saying: ‘Look, if this starts getting worse, they can use our hotel if they need to,’” Rogers recalled.  Michael Jacobson, president of the Illinois Hotel & Lodging Association, said Chicago and state officials asked hotels in early March to identify locations that could be used.  Some offered free rooms; others at cost. Tight security ensures nobody breaks social distancing rules. Rather than housecleaning, linens and towels are left outside rooms, along with meals.  “Hotels aren’t making a profit out of this. It is allowing them to at least maintain some basic operations and frankly, keep at least a portion of their staff employed,” Jacobson said. “I knew folks would step up, there’s no question about it, but I also knew that every hotel owner I know of is hurting right now, and hurting bad.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 8, "positive": 14, "negative": 6, "joy": 5, "anger": 6, "fear": 3, "trust": 8}, "metadata": ["hotel", "deployed", "physician", "park", "seasons", "college", "shifts", "healthcare", "restaurants", "acknowledged", "elmhurst", "hospital", "los", "las", "donate", "coronavirus", "arizona", "tourism", "illinois", "distancing"]}, {"text": "SAN ANTONIO (AP) - A fifth scheduled execution of a Texas death row inmate has been delayed because of the coronavirus spread around the state.  Carlos Treviño’s execution, which had been set for June 3, was postponed to Sept. 30.  Treviño, 45, was condemned for the 1996 gang rape and fatal stabbing of a 15-year-old girl in San Antonio.  The execution date was changed on Thursday by state District Judge Jennifer Peña in San Antonio.  While Peña didn’t mention COVID-19 in her order, Treviño’s attorneys had argued “the COVID-19 pandemic has created insurmountable obstacles to adequate legal representation, constitutes a substantial public health risk and demands enormous public resources.”  The Bexar County District Attorney’s Office didn’t object to changing the execution date.  Three other executions that had been scheduled this year were delayed by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals while another was delayed by a judge in East Texas.  For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks.

More than 100 went home unknowingly carrying the coronavirus.  The wayward boxing fans led an inevitable rise in infections this month that forced the government to abandon its hesitant approach to combating COVID-19 that failed to inspire public confidence.  As of Saturday, confirmed cases from three boxing stadiums in Bangkok totaled 104, just over a quarter of the national toll of 411. An actor, a major-general, a politician, a boxing trainer and a slew of ordinary fans are among the coronavirus cases from the March 6 event.  It’s feared hundreds more in all corners of the country could be viral time bombs. Health officials take the threat seriously.  “The more people who report themselves, the easier it is for us to track down others with the virus before it’s too late.” said Dr. Thaveesin Visanuyothin, a spokesman for the Public Health Ministry.  But even as Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha this past week announced measures to fight the spread of COVID-19 - including postponing a major three-day holiday, shutting down schools and allowing provincial governors to close any gathering spaces - he insisted the country was not going into shutdown.  He told his countrymen the crisis had not yet reached Phase 3, an epidemic involving significant domestic transmission of the virus that would trigger more radical restrictions. How and when that would be determined is hard to judge, especially because Prayuth’s government has been criticized for a lack of transparency and consistency in releasing information.  Even a crackdown implemented this week on arrivals sends a mixed message. Instead of banning international flights, as several nations have done, foreign visitors must have health certificates affirming they are free of the virus. The requirement is impractical, because in many if not most countries, it’s hard to even get tested without showing symptoms of the illness.  Any illusion that Thailand would somehow avoid a spike in infections was dispelled this month with the discovery of a cluster case from a single discrete source. The infected people were a group of millennials who were reported to have been partying at an upmarket Bangkok nightspot with a visitor from Hong Kong. Health authorities scolded the partygoers for sharing drinks and cigarettes.  Just days later, a local celebrity in Muay Thai circles posted a message on his Instagram account. Muay Thai is the national sport, with a devoted fan base nationwide spanning social classes.  “This is NOT a joke, for those that have been in close contact with me the last few days please take precautions. I have the Covid-19 virus#covid 19,” said the March 13 message from Matthew Deane Chanthavanij, next to a video of him wearing a black surgical mask.  Some people initially derided his post as a publicity stunt, bogus information for which he could be criminally prosecuted. In fact, it exposed a second, potentially more dangerous cluster: the Lumpini Stadium boxing crowd.  Matthew Deane, as he is usually called, is an actor, model, singer and athlete. The Australian-born 41-year-old is also a serious devotee of Muay Thai, and even owns a boxing gym.  He was a master of ceremonies at the Lumpini Stadium match, stepping into the ring to interview boxers and promoters and hand out prizes to winners of a raffle.  The air-conditioned hall was hosting the first big Muay Thai event of the season. Eleven bouts started at 6 p.m and ended just after midnight. The crowd of about 5,000 roared every time punches and kicks were exchanged.  “We were squeezed against each other. Normally the place isn’t that crowded,” said Suwan Jitpinit, who traveled from his hometown in Sukhothai province, a 420-kilometer (260-mile) drive.  “At other regular events, there would be about 1,500 to 2,000 people in the stadium but because this was a special match, there were many more people,” recalled the 37-year-old boxing writer. He stayed in Bangkok for a match at another stadium before going home on March 10.  On the drive home, he began to feel feverish and was shivering so much he had to ask someone else to drive. When he arrived that evening, he went to a local hospital and was diagnosed with tonsillitis. Not feeling any better three days later, he sought help from a bigger hospital in nearby Phitsanulok.  After hearing the news about Matthew Deane, he asked to be tested for coronavirus. The result came back positive. His wife was infected too, and their village in Sukhothai is now under quarantine.  Ordinary boxing fans from other provinces, both near Bangkok and in the north, the northeast and the south, have also tested positive for the disease.  Among them: a local politician who is especially diligent in attending to his constituents in a province east of Bangkok.  According to reports in the Thai media, between the time he attended the Lumpini match and when he tested positive, Kitti Paopiamsap, head of the Chachoengsao provincial administration organization, attended six weddings, six funerals, three community meetings (two of them with the elderly), three Buddhist ordinations, three fairs and at least four other public meetings.  “It is sad that the boxing event has aggravated the situation,” said Pinit Polkhan, who shared announcing duties with Matthew Deane and like him caught the virus. “Certainly, the boxing industry is taking a hard hit, and the whole country as well.”   _____  Associated Press writer Busaba Sivasomboon contributed to this report.

CBS 2 Morning Insider Tim McNicholas has learned the struggling market has even resulted in some furloughs.  Virtual home tours have been around for years, but realtor Jesse Nocon and his team at Müv Real Estate had never used them.  “Let’s face it, a lot of people spending a lot of money on their properties, their homes, don’t want to buy a property via virtual tour,” he said.  Now it’s one of their only options to show off their listings.  “Currently we’re forbidden to do any open houses,” he said  Realtors can still show a property, but just to a few people at a time. When they do that, they’re providing hand sanitizer and leaving doors open, so no one has to touch the handles.  Spring and summer are typically peak real estate seasons, with people buying left and right. But right now?  “Bottom line is slow. The market is slow,” Nocon said.  Tim Mullet is a broker with Dream Town Realty, who recently applied for a small business loan to keep him afloat.  “If we’re not selling and closing homes, there’s no paycheck coming in, right?” he said. “If you can afford the time to wait, maybe wait a few weeks, but if you’re in a position where you need to buy or rent, we are here to help.”  The real estate brokerage Redfin recently furloughed about 40% of its agents.  Nocon said his team works on commission, so no one at Müv will be furloughed. That doesn’t mean they’re not hurting.  “We’re anticipating, hopefully, if this ends around summertime, real estate season will go on past the summer and into the fall and winter season,” he said.  He expects prices to drop slightly, but nothing major. The big change will be getting back to face-to-face tours.

Currently in its second week of a state of emergency, the city has taken steps to mitigate the financial effects of COVID-19.  On Monday, the city temporarily laid off just over 2,000 non-essential employees effective April 14.  Later in the day, at the recommendation of administration, Edmonton deferred property taxes until Sept. 30, as well as Business Improvement Area Tax Levy payment penalties until at least Aug. 31. The deferrals are optional, and taxpayers are urged to make their payments on time if they can afford to in order to help the city \"during these challenging times.\"  The Edmonton Chamber of Commerce said the city's decision to defer property tax payments will help struggling local businesses.  \"We talk to business owners every day about what they need during these difficult times,\" said Janet Riopel, the Edmonton Chamber of Commerce's president and CEO. \"While this is only one of many supports employers desperately need, deferring property taxes for a few months will make a difference for many business owners. Right now, every little bit helps.\"  Business Improvement Areas are parts of the city scheduled for revamp. There are 13 BIAs in Edmonton with north of 4,500 businesses.  Companies who cannot make their payments by the end of Tuesday can defer them and not face penalties.  The Downtown Business Association, one of the 13 BIAs, says it's pleased with the decision that will bring some financial stability to its business owners.   EDMONTON'S FINANCIAL IMPACT  Aside from the decisions made Monday, the city has also suspended transit fares and parking fees and closed its recreation centres.  The City of Edmonton spends approximately $440 million per month: $240 million in operations and $200 million in capital costs. At that rate, the city expects to spend its reserves in six months.  Administration has worked out budget implications for three different scenarios: the COVID-19 pandemic ending at the end of April, mid-June or mid-September.  Best case scenario, the pandemic has a net impact of $27.8 million on Edmonton. If it lasts until mid-June, the city projects to lose $61.1 million, and worst case scenario — $112.3 million.  \"COVID-19 is taking a terrible toll on our city,\" said City of Edmonton Manager Adam Laughlin.

Now in 2020, the IMF is suddenly bailing out half the world. “They really did good job for themselves; they became something in this world from being completely marginalized and worthless.”  Stacy Herbert notes that during this coronavirus pandemic everybody discovered “the magic of the printing press” and that “nobody actually has to work.”  What was all that stuff about Greece then? Why were they forcing austerity on them when, apparently, they have a trillion dollars? the Keiser Report hosts wonder.

Yelich has been keeping busy recently by playing catch with his brother in the Los Angeles area. (Photo: Michael McLoone / USA TODAY Sports)  In these days of \"safer at home\" while waiting out the coronavirus pandemic, what is a baseball player supposed to do to stay ready to play?  Go out in the street and play catch with your brother, just as you did as kids.  That's one of the ways Milwaukee Brewers star Christian Yelich is trying to stay in baseball shape, he revealed in an interview Thursday morning on ESPN's SportsCenter.  Asked by anchor David Lloyd if he is trying to stay in shape, not knowing if and when baseball might resume, Yelich said, \"You try the best you can. It's kind of unprecedented times right now. There's not really places to go to hit or do any of that stuff.  The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin are providing this story for free.

Live Updates: The latest on coronavirus in Wisconsin  Daily Digest: What you need to know about coronavirus in Wisconsin  \"I've got my brother around, so I've been playing catch with him, actually in the street, at some points throughout the day. Just try to do the best you can. It takes you back to being 10 years old, when we used to do that when we were little kids. That's probably the last time we did something like that. You've got to try to stay semi-ready in the event that something goes down, whenever that might be.\"  Folks have been encouraged to stay at home to prevent further spread of COVID-19, particularly in \"hot spots\" such as the Los Angeles area, where Yelich lives. Even so, he was asked what the occasional passerby might think, seeing a baseball star out in the street playing catch.  \"That's happened a few times,\" Yelich said. \"There's a lot of people going for walks, or they'll drive by. It's always a good laugh. It's kind of funny.\"  Yelich didn't say which of his younger brothers was playing catch for him, but it could have been Collin, who was a catcher in the minor leagues with Atlanta (2015-16) and Miami (2017).  As for what an average day has been like otherwise for him, Yelich said, \"Just try to stay busy; find things to do. Obviously, while staying at home. We're just trying to do our part right now, make sure we stay in side, keep away from each other. Try to slow this thing down.  \"Just try to do some at-home workouts; watch some TV shows. Really just do the best you can to occupy yourself throughout the day.\"  Less than a week before exhibition games were halted and spring camps were shut down, Yelich and the Brewers made huge news with the announcement they reached agreement on a nine-year, $215-million contract extension that should keep him with the club for the remainder of his career. Both sides gave a little to reach the deal, which included $188.5 million in new money, full no-trade protection and no \"out\" clauses that would end it prematurely.  Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich answers questions after the announcement of his $188.5 million extension with the team. (Photo: Roy Dabner, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)  \"It's somewhere I love playing,\" Yelich said when asked about his thought process in negotiating that deal. \"It's an unbelievable sports state and city. I have a really good relationship with ownership, the front office, the coaching staff. It's somewhere I felt comfort and wanted to play. I was fortunate to be able to work it out.  \"It's a long process. It's something that went on for a few months. During those things, there are a lot of times when you think it's going to get done, when you think it's not going to get done. It goes back and forth a lot those last few days. Fortunately, we were able to get something figured out.\"  The excitement created by that announcement reverberated from Phoenix to Milwaukee and throughout the baseball world, a rare occasion of a small-market team able to keep a superstar player. In his two years with the Brewers, Yelich has won a pair of batting titles, was named the National League most valuable player in 2018 and the runner-up in 2019.  Not coincidentally, Milwaukee went to the playoffs in both of those seasons, advancing to within a game of the World Series in '18 before getting eliminated by eventual champion Washington last season in the wild-card game. Despite considerable turnover on the big-league roster over the offseason, the Brewers expected to be in the hunt again for the playoffs in 2020, with Yelich leading the way, in his prime at 28.  Instead, as with all sports, major league baseball remains on hold, waiting to see if it will be possible to play even a shortened season.  \"It's definitely been different,\" Yelich said on the SportsCenter segment. \"It all happened really fast on our end. We were in the middle of spring training. Things started to change really quickly. We went from playing games to being at home within, probably, about 48 hours.\"  Christian Yelich heads to the dugout from his spot in left field during the Brewers' game against the Angels.

Researchers from UC-Davis and the University of Oregon published their report in the journal mSystems and came up with some recommendations for healthier work spaces in the age of COVID-19.  Two of their suggestions: opening windows for better air circulation and opening blinds or drapes for more natural sunlight.  Although more research is needed to better understand the impact of natural light on the virus indoors, “daylight exists as a free, widely available resource to building occupants with little downside to its use and many documented positive human health benefits,” the researchers wrote in their paper.  The paper also urges building operators and office administrators to post signs reminding employees to wash their hands with soap and hot water for at least 20 seconds, to provide access to alcohol-based hand sanitizer and to implement new stringent cleaning protocols — especially for areas that are higher risk, such as near sinks and toilets.  The scientists also write that more air entering the building from the outside can dilute any virus particles that are already indoors.  “No filter system is perfect,” the study says. “Recently, it has been found that gaps in the edges of filters in hospitals has been a contributing factor of the failure of filtering systems to eliminate pathogens from the shared air environment.”  They also note that these viruses tend to prefer drier air, so a more humid environment indoors is another way to potentially prevent the virus from spreading or even make it inactive. In addition, all those open-office design plans instituted by tech, media and finance firms over the last decade may not be the best for the current public health crisis.  “Modern buildings are generally designed to promote social mixing — from open plan living areas in homes to open offices where many workers share space. By promoting interaction and chance encounters, these layouts are thought to generate more creativity and teamwork. At the same time, they are probably also really great for spreading viruses around,” a press release accompanything the study states.  As of Monday evening, more than 577,000 people have tested positive for COVID-19 in the US, where the disease has killed 23,078.

In case of emergency, you’d have access to a change of clothes, medications, cash, food, water and other items to help you shelter in place or make the long, unexpected journey home.  Do you still have your bag? Did you ever have one? I don’t know many who maintained them. If they had them, the money paid for a happy hour long ago and the snacks were eaten.  How about a flu shot? Did you get one last year?  Flu shots are a good indicator of our collective preparedness. Twice a year, the world’s top viral experts gather to select the three or four strains that shots will combat in coming months. In 2009, H1N1/swine flu — our last pandemic — was not identified until after shots were made. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that flu during that pandemic caused more than 61 million infections and 12,469 deaths.  But even if H1N1 had been included in the shot, only 41.2 percent of Americans over 6 months old got a shot for the 2009-2010 flu season. To improve access, state governments later eased regulations so pharmacists could give flu shots. That’s why you can get flu shots everywhere these days.  Despite this easier access and promotional campaigns, only 40 percent to 60 percent of Americans are estimated to have gotten shots for the current flu season.  A flu shot will not stop COVID-19, but what the government has done to fight the flu and how the public has responded shows how we must adapt to pandemic culture.  President Trump declared a nationwide state of emergency to try to prevent the spread of the virus. He restricted travel to stop the influx of infected individuals. He convened scientists, healthcare providers and business leaders to find a cure, comfort the sick and stabilize the economy.  In his address to the nation, the president reminded us that “no nation is more prepared or more resilient.” He urged putting politics aside to “unify together as one nation and one family.”  Money was appropriated. But the solution is much more than money.  Like with the flu, regulatory reform is something to rally around. Last year, the Trump administration enacted new rules to reduce paperwork and increase speed and efficiency. New emergency waivers allow hospitals to increase workloads without running afoul of Medicare and Medicaid rules. Restrictions on telehealth options will be lifted. As Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health said, opportunities increase when we “remove the constraints” to fighting the virus.  It doesn’t need to stop there. Before COVID-19 exploded, the White House proposed reforms to the National Environmental Policy Act — regulation that affects major construction and land-use decisions.  These reforms can also help improve healthcare infrastructure. In China, which is reporting gains against the virus, the government reportedly constructed a 1,000-bed hospital in only 10 days. Conversely, the 2016 opening of the 305-bed Stamford Hospital in Connecticut took 50 months. For quality, China’s facility probably can’t compete with Stamford — but America would also not be able to respond so quickly under NEPA’s mandate.  Also in China, communities most affected by COVID-19 are on lockdown with some residents literally sealed in their homes without regard for civil liberties. That will not and should not happen here. But when considering how to personally respond to COVID-19, Americans would do well to heed the words of another president, John F. Kennedy, who urged Americans to “ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country.”  Practice social distancing and self-isolation. Battle through cabin fever and the urge to put yourself potentially in infectious situations like mass gatherings. And be neighborly. If you’re hoarding, spare a roll of toilet paper for the unfortunate in your community. The more conscious we are about preventing the spread of the virus, the faster it can be contained.  This is your opportunity to make up for your neglected go bag or lack of a flu shot.  H1N1 was never eradicated. People still get it, but there’s a vaccine and it’s under control. COVID-19 research is proceeding at breakneck pace with promising leads. The Trump administration is working with businesses like Walgreens and Walmart on testing and containing the virus.  And this, too, shall pass.

But to do so would require commandeering thousands of test kits each week for millionaire pro athletes and support staff, something many view as unseemly, especially when ordinary Americans are waiting in line.  Leagues know it would be a terrible look for them to jump the testing line. Acutely aware of the potential backlash, commissioners and owners are saying that, until the public has more access to testing, they don't want to secure tests for players.  The NBA even told teams in a memo Thursday that it would be inappropriate to test asymptomatic players and coaches for now — but the league does expect to have testing available when it's time to return to practices and games.  The NBA plans to allow teams to reopen some facilities May 8, but only for voluntary workouts and in cities where local governments allow.  And there is no timetable yet for a return to practices and games, in large part because the testing issue remains unsolved.  \"We would have to ensure that testing is widely available and front-line health care workers have access before we begin talking about regular testing in the context of professional sports,\" NBA spokesman Mike Bass said.  The economic impact of sports not happening is beyond enormous: From athletes — NBA players alone stand to lose roughly $850 million in salaries if this season doesn't resume — to the thousands of part-time workers around stadiums.  Broadcasters have lost millions and furloughed thousands of workers, and sports books saw nearly 80% less action this March than they did in March 2019.  All of the above reduces tax revenue to local governments.  President Donald Trump wants sports back for both economic and morale reasons, knowing that once games start getting played again, Americans will have something to cheer for — whether fans are in the stands or not.  Sports leaders have met with the White House multiple times to discuss that goal.  Trump has been told testing availability is critical to any restart plans, a person with direct knowledge of those talks told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because few details of the conversations were to be publicly shared.  \"I don't want people to get used to this because this virus is going to be gone,\" Trump said in a White House coronavirus briefing. \"And when it's gone, you want to get back to normal.\"  Harvard researchers say the U.S. should be testing at least a half-million people daily, while the White House estimates about 200,000 tests are being administered each day.  Some teams were sharply criticized for getting their players tested when the pandemic was beginning to take hold in March.  The leagues want to avoid a similar blowback.  \"The threshold question is the health question. That's where we're spending the most time,\" MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said. \"The ones that are the most worrisome are the ones that are beyond their control.\"  According to Major League Baseball, 3,000 kits would need to be available for players, staff, broadcasters and others for every round of testing to get its season going and keep it going.  Even if the NHL and NBA return with just 16 postseason teams on the ice and courts, those leagues would likely require tests for a minimum of 1,000 players and staff.  And there's no telling how often — Daily? Every few days? Weekly? — the tests would be required to be administered.  With tests still in short supply, that's not a great look.  \"We know that 50% of people are asymptomatic and we need to catch them before they spread the disease,\" Dr. Vincent DeGennaro, the CEO of rapid-test maker Abacus Pharma International, told Miami television station WFOR this week. \"And by testing everybody and having those tests here, we should be able to start to get back to some semblance of normalcy and talk about opening up.\"  Some health care officials have said an equally problematic issue is a shortfall of personal protective equipment — masks, gowns, gloves and the like — that are needed by the people tasked with administering the tests.  \"We don't want to use a disproportionate number of testing resources if it's limited,\" NFL lead counsel Jeff Pash said. \"We want to make sure that we're testing people in an appropriate way if we do it and have clear and consistent standards. I think that we very much would take our guidance on that from the medical and public health experts.\"  Dr. Rebekah Gee, Louisiana's former health secretary and CEO of Louisiana State University's health services division, said reopening of sports should not be considered until the country gets a handle on the sickest people through testing and contact tracing.  \"I'm a huge (New Orleans) Saints fan and I want to go to the Superdome too,\" Gee said. \"But am I willing to risk my life for this? No, I'm not. We've got to be smart and shouldn't be giving people false reassurances.\"  The PGA Tour said it is reviewing what it will need from a testing standpoint before its scheduled return to play without fans in June.  NASCAR is returning later this month, also without fans — and without COVID-19 testing.  Temperatures of everyone accessing the track will be taken and other strict precautions will be in place, but for now coronavirus tests are not part of the restart plans.

Last week, the diocese sent a message to pastors of Rhode Island churches, encouraging them to take steps to avoid the spread of the flu, which is considered widespread in the state. At the time the message was sent, the diocese was not aware of any cases of coornavirus in the state, a spokesperson said on Monday. Because both the flu and COVID-19 are passed by respiratory droplets, the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention encourages taking the same steps to avoid getting sick. \"As pastors committed to promoting and protecting the well-being of our parishioners, we need to be as cautious and prudent as possible in responding to any possible threat, especially for children and the elderly,\" the statement said in part. \"Since conditions vary from one locale to another, the most effective approach is at the level of the local parish.\"  During mass, priests are asked to avoid announcing or exchanging the Sign of Peace. If it is announced, parishioners are asked to avoid shaking hands, embracing or other physical contact. \"A simple gesture, or even a silent prayer, could easily suffice,\" the statement said.  Similarly, churches where parishioners usually hold hands during the Lord's Prayer are asked to avoid doing so. In addition, churches are asked to stop offering wine from a shared chalice during Holy Communion. Those who are giving out communion are encouraged to \"be especially mindful\" of personal hygiene, using hand sanitizer before mass or right before the distribution of communion.  Those who are ill should not attend mass, the diocese said, for the sake of those around them.  \"Parishioners should be reminded that if they have symptoms of serious illness they are dispensed from attending Holy Mass on Sundays and in fact should not attend Holy Mass,\" the statement said. \"This is an obligation in charity that parishioners should take very seriously.\"  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 3, "positive": 13, "negative": 1, "joy": 2, "anger": 2, "fear": 10, "trust": 3}, "metadata": ["coronavirus", "spokesperson", "flu", "respiratory", "encourages", "promoting", "well-being", "children", "announcing", "holy", "ill", "symptoms", "charity"]}, {"text": "More than a billion children are currently out of school with no return date.  As we enter another month with educational institutions around the world in lockdown, it has become clear that the Covid-19 outbreak has the potential to forever change not just how we learn, but how we think about learning.  While the world’s schools, colleges and universities may be closed, education must go on. This is a challenge unlike any we have faced before, but it is also an opportunity to harness the human capacity for learning and to further develop our tools.  In this environment, online systems, data-driven structures, and artificially intelligent algorithms offer critical resources for students, teachers and even parents. But realising the full value of these resources requires re-thinking how our education systems interact with technology, forging a new path and incorporating technology into every aspect of learning.  For several years now education has been one of the fastest growing sectors in technology. According to HolonIQ, a global education intelligence firm, the ‘Edtech’ field is projected to be worth $341 billion by 2025.  This is unsurprising given its obvious potential, not just today, but for the cities of tomorrow, which will need to be agile enough to embrace change and disruption. Those that thrive will be the ones already investing in the wider strategic infrastructure that supports online learning.  Communities around the world have been wrangling with the demands of continued support for education through the Covid-19 lockdown. When Abu Dhabi closed schools on March 9th, the emirate immediately activated an “at home” model, with all of its school children continuing to learn through online platforms.  In a time of social distancing, that means that not only can students continue to learn, they can also continue to engage with their peers and their teachers. And during these trying times, it is clearer than ever just how important these relationships remain for our mental and emotional health.  That shouldn’t be regarded as a replacement for the social warmth of physical classrooms and human interaction, but it is a viable way to foster and maintain connections when the alternatives are not available.  In some areas, we shouldn’t be afraid of also considering how to retain some of these technologies in a post-Covid-19 world. Learning online means students can progress at their own pace, with personalised systems that puts each student at the centre of every class. Instant and ongoing assessments also provide teachers with feedback on individual progress, giving them a chance to adjust, correct and spend additional time on material through one-on-one instruction.  Videos, games and interactivity can also keep the lessons flowing, harnessing an approach known as the “gamification of learning”. This motivates them to learn, practice, and ultimately achieve full mastery of the material. The most successful platforms also allow for streamlined and consistent delivery of lessons, relieving teachers and parents of the time needed to build resources from scratch. This frees them up to focus on the actual delivery of the lessons, maximising their direct engagement with students.  It can be more than just continuing to teach, it can be a qualitative shift in our education systems if we grasp the nettle.  This is not to say that embracing Edtech is without challenge. For example, schools need to be scaled up with the necessary IT infrastructure and hardware, while external systems themselves have to be able to handle the processing demands of home access.  Similarly, the tools we use also have to be based on sound learning principles and properly aligned with national curricula, with the most important stakeholders in mind: the teachers and students. From a design perspective, teachers and students will bring endless varied challenges and Edtech systems must be designed with this diversity in mind, especially for those students with special educational needs.  Lastly, we should not be so arrogant as to assume that teachers and parents can simply be “dropped” into Edtech systems. Software designers may always be confident that their tools are eminently intuitive for all users, but the reality is that scaling up online technologies also means ensuring we provide support in the form of the training required for our students and children, helping them to get the maximum value from these technologies.  These things are not easy. They take time, they take investment and they require a government that is committed to deploying innovative systems in an environment that doesn’t always rapidly embrace change. Abu Dhabi invested heavily over the years, directly and indirectly, to support companies that deliver these programmes as well as a stable infrastructure to support them, giving the emirate and its students flexibility and a way forward.  Ultimately, the most effective providers will be those who keep users at the heart of their endeavours, offering a holistic learning experience which ensures that no student misses a beat, whether inside the classroom or out.  And the education systems that are best placed to thrive in a post-Covid-19 world will be those who retain the technologies and tools that have been tested so fiercely during this outbreak.

The man had underlying health conditions and is believed to have been infected with the coronavirus while traveling, state epidemiologist Angela Dunn said. She declined to provide details about where he had visited.  The man, who had been at home before going to the hospital, tested positive for having the coronavirus Saturday, Dunn said. Health officials are working to identify and contact anyone who may have been in close contact with him. Anyone who did will be asked to quarantine themselves, she said.  She urged those over 60 or who have compromised immune systems to avoid contact with others during the outbreak.  “We are in this for the long haul,” she said.  The family of the man who died followed the correct procedure by calling the hospital before he arrived to report his possible coronavirus diagnosis, Lakeview Hospital CEO Troy Wood said. Workers met him in the hospital’s parking lot in full protective gear, limiting possible exposure.  Utah Gov. Gary R.

It declined in 2016 and in 2015, too. This loss isn’t equally distributed across the male population. Life expectancy in the US has long reflected inequality—the wealthy outlive the poor, and black Americans die younger than whites—but it has generally risen across demographics for a century. This recent decline, by contrast, is strongly tied to a specific group: less-educated white people, particularly working-class white men. And many of the deaths they’re dying early are of a specific type: suicide, drug overdoses, and diseases linked to alcohol abuse. Estimated to number around 600,000 in the past two decades, they’re called “deaths of despair.”  Our response to the new coronavirus will almost certainly multiply such deaths. Stay-at-home orders and social distancing more broadly exacerbate the conditions that foster deaths of despair.  This isn’t an argument for letting COVID-19 run wild—that would be deeply harmful too, as a grimly mounting death toll even with mitigation shows. Yet it’s much easier for someone like me to accept a stay-at-home order as the needful, ethical choice to save lives than it is for someone vulnerable to a death of despair . It’s easy for me, with a job I already did from home and a tech-savvy church and circle of friends, to opine about the necessity of fighting this pandemic. But if you live in a dying coal town in western Pennsylvania where what little work was available has been prohibited for weeks, and your internet connection is too slow to stream Mass, and you haven’t talked to your elderly mother in days because she can’t pay her phone bill, and your kid’s getting into drugs while the high school is closed—well, the value of drastic public health measures isn’t so clear.  There’s no single reason for deaths of despair , but three significant causes reflect both what we observe in communities where these deaths are rising and what Scripture tells us about human nature. All three causes will be intensified by this pandemic.   No Job  The first is economic hopelessness from lack of work. Unlike poverty or income inequality, a “consistently strong economic correlate [to deaths of despair] is the percentage of a local population that is employed,” reports the New Yorker. Research published there from Angus Deaton and Anne Case, a pair of Nobel Prize–winning economists, found “that the places with a smaller fraction of the working-age population in jobs are places with higher rates of deaths of despair, and that this holds true even when you look at rates of suicide, drug overdoses, and alcohol-related liver disease separately. They all go up where joblessness does.”  Of course they do! Loss of work has ramifications far beyond lower income. It affects our conception of ourselves, our worth, and our relationships. God’s design for humanity always has—and always will—include a balance of good work and good rest. God himself modeled this in the creation story of Genesis 1, and immediately thereafter tasked Adam with tending the Garden of Eden (Gen. 2:15). Jesus promised his followers abundant rest and an “easy” yoke (Matt. 11:28–29), not no yoke. And even the transporting vision of the new Earth in Isaiah 65:17–25 describes a humanity that still finds purpose in meaningful labor: “My chosen ones will long enjoy the work of their hands,” God says. “They will not labor in vain … for they will be a people blessed by the Lord.” When there is no good work to do, it is no surprise to find people in despair.   Article continues below   No Friends  The second cause is breakdown of local community. Our country (and indeed much of the Western world) has a crisis of loneliness. We don’t spend time with each other as we are made to do. We have dangerously declining levels of social trust and disintegrating institutions of civil society, as Robert D. Putnam detailed in his seminal book on the subject, Bowling Alone. “Without at first noticing,” Putnam writes, “we have been pulled apart from each other”—only now, the isolation of pandemic forces this reality before us every day, most vividly for those without the emotional insulation afforded by financial stability.   No Faith  Community dissolution is closely related to the third cause of deaths of despair: a decline in religiosity, by which I mean the institutions and shared life rhythms of an active and sustaining faith. “The woes of the white working class are best understood not by looking at the idled factories but by looking at the empty churches,” Timothy Carney argued in his 2019 book, Alienated America. Economics obviously matters, but Carney presents compelling statistical evidence that loss of church life is the most overlooked, important driver of despair.  This too is precisely what Christians should expect. When God declares in Genesis 2:18 that it is “not good for man to be alone,” he speaks of much more than the companionship of marriage. Scripture consistently calls us to a life together—not that there is never occasion for isolation, but that normal human life should be spent in community ordered around following Jesus. Part of the horror of the Crucifixion is Christ’s isolation (John 16:32), and the Epistles bristle with exhortations to be together (Heb. 10:24–25), eat together (1 Cor. 11:33), worship together (1 Cor. 14:26–27), and together “grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ” (Eph. 4:15–16, ESV). When church community dissolves, despair will crystallize.  All three causes of deaths of despair feed each other—“white Americans are less likely to attend religious services when they are unemployed,” Carney notes, and a church with less attendance is more likely to close, removing one more source of healthy community. All three causes are fed by this pandemic, too, and deaths of despairwill rise accordingly. For Christians, the challenge will be to work within the constraints of pandemic response to offer whatever relief, hope, and solace we can; to speak out for the despairing (Prov. 31:8–9); and to fight the evil of loneliness for every inch it tries to claim.

(AP) - Nebraska churches are taking a cautious approach to resuming worship services even though the state will allow them to gather their members again starting next month.  The Rev. Michael McCabe of St. Joseph Catholic Church in Lincoln said he’s looking forward to seeing his congregation again on Sunday mornings, but he’s not sure exactly when that will happen. Gov. Pete Ricketts has announced plans to begin easing restrictions in the state starting May 4, including allowing churches to reopen if they take certain precautions.  The governor’s office said churches will need to refrain from passing items between worshipers and people from different households will have to sit 6 feet apart.  For now, McCabe’s church will continue to worship online.  “Health comes first at this point in time,” McCabe said.  The Catholic Archdiocese of Omaha said services will be allowed again beginning May 4, but the archbishop is leaving the reopening decision up to pastors and their parish councils.  “I am grateful that soon we will be able to welcome parishioners back to our churches for Mass,” Archbishop George Lucas said. “We will work within the necessary restrictions for everyone’s safety.”  At Christ Community Church in west Omaha, the Rev. Mark Ashton said the church hasn’t decided when it will start having services in its worship center again, but it won’t rush to restart services partly because it has a strong online option. The church has about 3,000 members, and its worship center holds about 1,600.  “If we were to do appropriate social distancing, really we’re talking more like about 400 or 500 would be able to fit in there,” Ashton said. “So we’re asking some strategic questions about people’s worship experience and then we would have to expand the number of services to be able to accommodate a similar number of people.”  Nebraska health officials said the number of coronavirus cases in the state increased by 311 this weekend to at least 2,732 cases. The actual number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested and studies suggest people can be infected without feeling sick.  Three additional deaths were also reported in Nebraska on Saturday, so the total of deaths rose to 53.  Hall County, which is home to Grand Island, continues to lead the state in COVID-19 cases with 797. The much more populous Douglas County, which includes the state’s largest city of Omaha, has 382 cases.  For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and death.

On Wednesday San Diego County authorities announced they were extending lockdowns “indefinitely” despite lowering trends and extremely low COVID mortality rates.  As of Wednesday night Governor Newsom plans to force all beaches across the state to close as warm weather approaches.  Missouri is discussing a plan to reopen and Virginia’s governor told residents to expect a full economic reopening to take at least two years.  If it looks like no one knows what the hell is going on anywhere that’s because no one knows what the hell is going on anywhere. At this point the models are bunk, the reporting from hospitals is bunk and the statistics are bunk – mucked up by the promise of federal dollars for every reported COVID death.  Orange County seems to have the best approach – trust businesses and patrons to make the right decisions for their customers and their own safety. But what about everyone else? There seems to be no consensus on what the “right way” to open is. About the only thing people can agree on is that somebody else is wrong.  After being told in early March we needed “15 days to flatten the curve” we were then told we need “30 days to slow the spread” and then every blue state government went insane with power after that. The goal posts keep changing and every day more and more Americans are throwing up their hands in frustration. Everyone wants to know what “reopening” will look like.  Well, I can tell you exactly how America will reopen.  America will reopen when people show up at the beach anyway.  America will reopen when small businesses have been pushed to the point where they have to decide if feeding their families is worth risking arrest.  America will reopen when your neighbor goes ahead with that small birthday party they were planning.  America will reopen when you start meeting in the park for playdates.  America will reopen when performers start playing in the streets for tips.  America will reopen when nail salons start figuring out how to quietly and safely serve desperate housewives and barbershops start figuring out how to quietly and safely serve hairy husbands.  America will reopen when block parties start and Sunday visits to grandma and cocktail dates with your best friend on the front porch or in their kitchen.  America will reopen when the teenagers decide there’s no way they’re living one more day without their friends.  America will reopen when Americans who are ready feel safe to mix and mingle and protect each other where possible and appropriate.  I’m not telling you to be reckless. I’m telling you I trust Americans to be safe because no one loves your family more than you do.  The point is – America’s reopening will not be an act of “permission” from the ruling class. It will be like everything else important in this nation’s history – from the American Revolution to suffrage to the Civil Rights Era. It will be an act of will by the American people themselves. It will be resisted by the elitists in charge and we’ll do it anyway. It will be scolded by our “betters” in government and we’ll do it anyway. It will be ridiculed by the coastal Harvard set and we’ll do it anyway. Everything that has ever been good for the citizens of this country has been demanded and won by the people, not the permanent political class.  We’ll win our freedom (again) by small acts 0f rebellion and autonomy. One by one they’ll pile up – hugging your neighbor, meeting a friend, cutting hair. Civil liberties groups will file their suits and Americans will remind their politicians – big and small – that they serve at the will of the people, not the other way around.  America will reopen when you say it’s time…not when they do.

(Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)  There was a lot of debate and finger-pointing over the last week or so on the wisdom of in-person primary voting in Wisconsin in the midst of a pandemic, whether absentee ballot deadlines should have been extended, etc. The Supreme Court even got involved.  But New York Times columnist Paul Krugman brought his own special brand of stupid into the mix with his hot take on what happened. In a piece with a headline and subheadline that reads “American Democracy May Be Dying – Authoritarian rule may be just around the corner”, Krugman wrote:  Yet the scariest news of the past week didn’t involve either epidemiology or economics; it was the travesty of an election in Wisconsin, where the Supreme Court required that in-person voting proceed despite the health risks and the fact that many who requested absentee ballots never got them. Why was this so scary? Because it shows that America as we know it may not survive much longer. The pandemic will eventually end; the economy will eventually recover. But democracy, once lost, may never come back. And we’re much closer to losing our democracy than many people realize.  He compared not canceling a primary here in the United States to the political situation in Hungary where, he states, the government gave “[Viktor] Orban the power to rule by decree”:  What happened in Hungary, beginning in 2011, was that Fidesz, the nation’s white nationalist ruling party, took advantage of its position to rig the electoral system, effectively making its rule permanent. Then it further consolidated its control, using political power to reward friendly businesses while punishing critics, and moved to suppress independent news media. Until recently, it seemed as if Viktor Orban, Hungary’s de facto dictator, might stop with soft authoritarianism, presiding over a regime that preserved some of the outward forms of democracy, neutralizing and punishing opposition without actually making criticism illegal. But now his government has used the coronavirus as an excuse to abandon even the pretense of constitutional government, giving Orban the power to rule by decree.  We're heading down the path of Hungary. The outrage in Wisconsin was just the latest step https://t.co/m73NGaleJv — Paul Krugman (@paulkrugman) April 10, 2020  So American democracy is soon to be replaced with authoritarian rule because a governor was not allowed to rewrite election law by decree and a primary was not suspended? Krugman’s argument literally makes no sense, as several people pointed out:  This is just amazingly stupid. In Hungry, their leader has been given the power to rule by decree. in Wisconsin, the governor tried to cancel the election *by decree,* was stopped by the courts, and Krugman is complaining that makes us more like Hungary Cc @PolitiBunny https://t.co/AHwhUd9aL0 — (((Aaron “Worthing” Walker))) (@AaronWorthing) April 10, 2020  …we’re headed down the path of Hungary, which suspended elections because we ::checks notes:: refused to suspend elections? — Ian Patrick Hines (@ianpatrickhines) April 10, 2020  Excellent point. The only way for us to avoid a Hungarian style dictatorship is for the federal government to force everyone to stay inside their homes under penalty of law. — Gert B. Frobe (@ThumblessGrasp) April 10, 2020  And on the issue of putting voter health at risk because of politics, there was also Joe Biden’s endorsement of in-person primary voting in Wisconsin even after the DNC decided to postpone their convention, which was scheduled to be held in July in Wisconsin:   https://twitter.com/colinkalmbacher/status/1245853635591802881  Remember this, too: Biden was actually encouraging people to do in-person voting on “Super Tuesday II” in mid-March as the pandemic was spreading, as long as those voters were “feeling healthy, not showing symptoms, and not at risk of being exposed to COVID-19”:  The right to vote is the most sacred American right there is. State election officials are working closely with public health officials to hold safe elections. If you are feeling healthy, not showing symptoms, and not at risk of being exposed to COVID-19: please vote on Tuesday. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) March 15, 2020  This was just days after Trump’s address to the nation announcing Europe travel restrictions and other measures, and well after the CDC declared that even asymptomatic carriers of the virus could transmit the disease.  All of this was conveniently left out of Kruggie’s diatribe, of course, because it didn’t fit his narratives.  I’d advise Krugman to “be better” going forward, but he’s shown time and time again that when it comes to political disagreements, that he is simply incapable of doing so.

A total of 89 people have been put under quarantine after a 19-year-old delivery agent from a restaurant in Malviya Nagar tested positive for the virus on April 14.  Many Delhitees on Thursday woke up to a barrage of messages on their WhatsApp groups strictly advising them not to order food from outside anymore.  \"Our area is largely an open colony, so we cannot check everybody who is coming in. We have circulated the clippings in the whatsapp groups, with a message: \"Bhai, thode din ghar ka bana hi kha lo. Fizool main quarantine hone ka koi faida nahi hai\" (Please for some days eat home-made food only, you won't be serving any purpose being quarantined due to this),\" BS Vohra, East-Delhi RWAs Joint Front told PTI.  \"We have been talking about this in the RWA whatsapp group since morning, but we don't know how to stop this. The government can perhaps take some steps, or at least instruct us to deploy some measures,\" he added.  While many had already bid goodbye to outside food after the lockdown was announced on March 24, there were others who couldn't resist the temptation for a meal from a restaurant at least on a few days.  But not anymore as they realise that hassle-free not always translates into risk-free, especially amid a global pandemic.  \"My daughter is a big foodie. She would always pester me to order momos or burgers for outside. Many times I would try to entice her with home-made snacks. But it won't always work. So there were days when we ordered food online.  \"Today when I watched this news of the delivery agent getting infected, I made it clear to my daughter that we won't be ordering online from now. She understood and agreed,\" said Vandana Thapa, a homemaker in her 40s.  Looking at the severity of the situation and fearing a dip in their online orders, food delivery platforms and several restaurants have reached out to their customers to reassure them of all the precautions taken at their end for their safety and well-being.  Zomato, the online platform service whose partner restaurant's delivery agent has tested positive in this incident, said they are constantly training their delivery partners on safety and hygiene in addition to providing masks to them.  \"Fifty thousand plus restaurants which cover a majority of our order volume have set up hand sanitisation stations for delivery partners. We continue to ramp up our safety practices as we speak,\" a Zomato spokesperson told PTI.  The food delivery platform on Wednesday launched a new safety feature where users can see the body temperature of their delivery partner on its app.  That said, they did acknowledge that despite \"best efforts'' home deliveries of essential services like food and grocery cannot be \"risk-free\".  \"Customers should be cognisant of the risks involved and follow careful package handling practices if they are getting anything home delivered,\" he added.  Pizza giant Domino's or restaurants like The Baker's Dozen, Out Of The Blue and Deli By The Blue also reassured their customers by listing out all the safety measures in place.  \"Understanding the current situation, we have taken some important measures for our staff and senior members and have made them stay quarantined at Hotel Le Sutra to maintain the utmost care and cleanliness discipline,\" said Rahul Bajaj, director and conceptualiser at Out Of The Blue and Deli By The Blue.  But the fear that the incident would dent the food industry business further was palpable among many restauranteurs.  According to Karan Tanna, founder of Ghost Kitchens, there would be a drop of more than 50 per cent in people ordering food online. The sector had already seen a drastic drop due to the spread of coronavirus.  Anurag Katriar, president, National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), too took notice of the event and admitted of \"some impact of the incident on the consumer's mind\".  However, Katriar used the analogy that like medical professionals, anyone working on ground zero can contract the virus and that it was no different for the delivery agent in question.  \"Ideally, if medical services are not getting impacted when their staff is infected, this incident should not impact the restaurant deliveries either, but in the minds of the people the essentiality of the two services is different and rightly so.  \"We have been very steadfast in our advisories to the restaurants, which was reiterated last evening that they need to follow the strictest form of hygiene with services and as well as goods,\" he added.

Testing and diagnosing people who have the disease is critical to tracking cases and managing the pandemic. But countries around the world have been unable to meet the demand to expand testing. Glenda Mary Davison answers key questions.   What’s available?  The molecular based tests used to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, are mostly developed in university research laboratories and manufactured by a number of commercial companies. These manufacturers are urgently ramping up production to meet the worldwide demand.  After the first case of COVID-19 was reported in December 2019, scientists were quickly able to decipher the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and share it with the rest of the world. This led to the development of molecular based tests which are very specific but can take two to three days to process and produce a result.  At the moment, in most parts of the world, this type of test is still the only one available.  How does this test work?  Molecular testing is based on the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). SARS-CoV-2 contains a single strand of RNA which holds the genetic code for the proteins the virus needs to replicate.  Before the test can be performed, viral genetic material must be extracted from the throat or via a nasal swab. The polymerase chain reaction, which is used to expand this genetic material, requires DNA, and so the viral RNA must first be converted to DNA using an enzyme called reverse-transcriptase. Only after this is done can the viral genome be copied millions of times until there is enough to be analysed and detected using a fluorescent dye.  The tests are mostly done in specialised laboratories. They require skilled experienced laboratory professionals and expensive equipment. In South Africa for example, the tests are carried out by the National Institute of Communicable Diseases, tertiary academic laboratories at the National Health Laboratory Service and some private laboratories.  What are the biggest challenges?  Not all laboratories are able to offer these tests. Another challenge is that the tests require skilled professionals and equipment. And there are limited test kits.  In the US the limited availability of tests means that many people who want to get tested can’t. In South Africa both public and private laboratories are struggling to keep up, and test kits are rapidly being depleted.  Because of the shortage of testing kits, the World Health Organisation has advised that tests should only be done when people show symptoms, are at high risk or are suspected of having been infected.  Another challenge is that the tests can take three to four days to process. This is a long time given the highly infectious nature of the virus.   What’s needed? What’s next?  There’s an urgent need for more rapid and widespread testing. In countries such as South Korea, where extensive testing was available, the government was more effective in controlling the spread and infection rate. Widespread testing of individuals – not only those showing symptoms – could reveal the true size of the pandemic and allow epidemiologists to predict and control the spread.  Another major breakthrough would be a test that could be performed at the point where the patient presents, and which can provide results within 15 to 20 minutes.  Many scientists are racing to develop antibody based tests which will produce faster results and are more cost effective. Antibody tests are cheaper and quicker to perform and may provide useful information on how widespread the infection really is.  One possibility is the serology tests which is used to detect other viruses such as HIV and Hepatitis.  Serology tests are positive in those who still have active virus as well as in patients who have already recovered but still have antibodies in their blood. These individuals may not be infectious as the virus has been eradicated. The testing of recovered individuals could provide important information on how the immune system responds and maintains immunity.  This type of testing could also be used as a screening test in the early stages of infection. This may be important as some individuals with few or no symptoms are still contagious.  How are the new tests being developed?  Researchers have begun by isolating and modifying sections of the spike proteins which are part of the outer surface of the virus. These proteins can be multiplied by using cells which are cultured in a laboratory. After this, the proteins are isolated and then fixed onto a solid surface.  The next step would be to add serum, which is separated from a blood sample. If antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are present, they will bind to the viral proteins on the solid surface and can be detected using a chemical that will change colour. This test is called an Enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) and has already been approved for use in some countries. But proper validation is still required. As soon as this is achieved, they will be distributed to other regions of the world including South Africa.  In China, after the massive spread of the infection, a point of care test was developed. It was called the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Kit. This test didn’t have to be performed in a laboratory and could deliver results within 15 minutes. Although it’s available, its results aren’t considered as reliable as the molecular tests. Many countries are therefore wary of introducing it until it has been fully validated.

Iceland Won’t Be Killing Any Whales This Year  Get the latest Waking Times articles delivered to your inbox. Sign up here.  Elias Marat, The Mind Unleashed   Waking Times  Iceland’s notorious tradition of killing whales may be finally coming to an end.  Earlier this week, one of the country’s two whaling companies announced that it would halt its whaling activities for good. The announcement came mere days after Iceland said that for the second consecutive year, all whale hunts would be canceled.  IP-Utgerd, one of the main companies specializing in hunting minke whales in Iceland, told AFP that it would hang up its harpoons mainly due to regulations introduced by the Icelandic government.  The company, which had been considering whaling with only a single boat in late June or early July, decided that it makes the most financial sense to simply abandon the summer season altogether rather than attempt to get around extended no-fishing coastal zones rolled out to protect marine life.  The delineation of such zones had forced the company to go further and further offshore due to the no-fishing zones, making such activities no longer financially viable in Icelandic waters, the company said.  Managing director Gunnar Bergmann Jonsson said:  “I’m never going to hunt whales again, I’m stopping for good.”  One of Iceland's two whaling companies has announced it will stop whaling for good It is now no longer economical to kill Whales Story by Kitty Block of Humane Society . Photo by Christin Khan/NOAA Fisheries pic.twitter.com/FX4MnQB7hN — Robb Edwards 🌱 (@RobRobbEdwards) April 27, 2020  The country’s largest whaling firm called Hvalur, which specializes in hunting fin whales, is also ceasing its operations for the second year in a row due to stiff competition from Japanese whaling firms, among other reasons.  Hulvar CEO Kristján Loftsson also admitted that the coronavirus pandemic would make it “extremely difficult, if not impossible” for his staff to work as normal due to their close proximity and the need to uphold physical distancing guidelines.  Loftsson also said that most of the whale meat it specializes in procuring is sold to Japan, where it is desired as an “iron-rich dietary supplement for anemia patients.” However, he added that his company is unable to compete with the Japanese whaling industry which is subsidized by the country’s government.  According to Humane Society International, a total of 146 fin whales and six minke whales were killed in 2018, the last year during which Iceland’s whaling fleet was active.  Animal rights advocates have warmly welcomed the news and trumpeted it as a signal that the whaling industry in Iceland may have come to an end.  For the second year in a row, neither of Iceland's whaling companies will be hunting this summer. One of them has even told press that they're stopping whaling for good!#OPSociety @RacingXtinction pic.twitter.com/JyeteGUm9u — Oceanic Preservation Society / OPS (@OP_Society) April 28, 2020  Fabienne McLellan, co-director of international relations at Ocean Care, told Mongabay:  “This is indeed terrific news that for a second straight year, vulnerable fin whales will get a reprieve from Hvalur hf’s harpoons, the sole fin whaling company. “This said, fin whaling has been suspended in Iceland in the past, only to resume. While it looks promising that whaling in Iceland might stop for good, the temporary cessation of fin whaling must become permanent.”  However, Arne Feuerhahn, the founder of Hard to Port, warned that whaling could potentially begin again next year – especially if Loftsson is able to figure out a way to get around COVID-19 guidelines and find a solution to the challenges presented by Japanese firms. He said:  “We’re celebrating the moment that there’s not going to be any whaling, but we’re also aware of the possibility that they’re going to resume next year. “We have to look at the past, and I know that with fin whaling, Iceland sometimes takes a pause for two years. “It’s a family business and he [Loftsson] wants to keep it alive, so despite all the problems with the Japanese market, and the problems in Iceland with the [Covid-19] guidelines, he might come up with a solution for it, and we could go back to whaling in 2021.”  Kitty Block, the CEO of Humane Society International, slammed Japan and Norway in a statement for defying the global moratorium on whaling and continuing to slaughter hundreds of animals every year, despite demand for the highly-subsidized whale meat declining.   Nevertheless, she said:  “The news from Iceland marks a major turning point in the battle against whaling. We are happy that the whaling companies there have realized the futility of this enterprise in the modern world.”  By Elias Marat | Creative Commons | TheMindUnleashed.com  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 11, "positive": 14, "negative": 5, "sadness": 1, "joy": 1, "anger": 9, "fear": 4, "trust": 1}, "metadata": ["marine", "japanese", "ceo", "coronavirus", "pandemic", "distancing", "preservation", "vulnerable", "guidelines", "challenges", "global"]}, {"text": "THE WORST of the coronavirus pandemic is still \"ahead of us\", the head of the World Health Organization has warned.

The Whitehouse accused the WHO of favouring China and botching their coronavirus response from the beginning in an attempt to conceal the seriousness of the bug.  President Trump also withdrew the US's $500million worth of funding to the organisation.  Britain and other big donors have made it clear they will continue to fund the organisation.

Most theories around herd immunity, rely on a vaccine to boost immunity levels.  Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19, admitted the organisation had thought the infection rate would be higher.  She continued: \"A number of studies we are aware of in pre-print have suggested that small proportions of the population [have antibodies].  “It is really important to understand how the studies were done.”  The WHO will now examine the test conditions and methods for these individual experiments, and check them for accuracy before releasing any official figures.

A Renters’ Market:’ Power Shifts From Landlords to Tenants With Evictions Off the Table in California  Erin Baldassari, Molly Solomon, KQED, 4/17/20  It was Jamie Bagley’s first apartment without roommates: a newly refurbished one-bedroom in downtown Oakland with sunlight streaming into the living room and a patio for her collection of outdoor plants.  At $2,195 per month, the veteran hairdresser felt like years of hard work were finally paying off. She moved in on February 9.  Then came the coronavirus, and, one by one, clients canceled appointments. Her income dried up. Now, Bagley, 42, is worried she may have to leave the apartment she worked so hard to rent.  “It seemed like I had just landed, that I finally had just come to this point in life where I was starting to get ahead,” Bagley said. “Now when I look into the future, it looks like I might have some hard decisions to make.”  Bagley is one of thousands of Californians who didn’t pay rent this month — a number that’s only expected to grow the longer workers are ordered to stay home. She and fellow renters are safe for now: On April 6, the state Judicial Council suspended new eviction filings for 90 days after the state of emergency is lifted.   Sponsored  It was a decision that tipped the balance of power in favor of tenants, according to attorneys who represent both landlords and renters, and one that property law experts and activists say could have major ripple effects across California’s housing market for months, if not years, to come.  “It used to be a landlords’ market, but now it’s a renters’ market,” said Gustavo Lopez, a realtor and property manager for a dozen rentals in the San Francisco Bay Area. “Nobody saw this coming.”  Tenant rights attorney Joseph Tobener said he’s been getting about 100 calls a week from people who’ve lost their jobs and won’t be able to pay rent.  Tobener said the big shift came after the Judicial Council’s decision to halt eviction proceedings statewide.  “A lightbulb went off,” Tobener said. “I was like, ‘are you kidding me? What are people supposed to do?’”   Power to the Tenants  Tobener’s firm, Tobener Ravenscroft LLP, is recommending tenants negotiate a rent deferment plan — even rent forgiveness — during the health emergency. The firm recently published a legal toolkit for tenants who have been financially burdened because of COVID-19, which also advises tenants with no other options to stop paying rent and refuse to leave.  Tobener predicts tenants likely won’t see an eviction judgement until sometime in 2021, because even when the courts do open, there will be a huge backlog of cases and the potential limitations of holding jury trials.  ‘It’s a real mess… It’s like the perfect shitstorm with the courts being closed.’Joseph Tobener, Tenant rights attorney  “It’s a real mess,” Tobener said. “It’s like the perfect shitstorm with the courts being closed.”  Jeff Woo, a San Francisco-based property attorney who represents landlords with Cooper White & Cooper LLP, also sees a backlog of cases in the courts’ future, and said that means time is now on the tenants’ side. The Judicial Council’s decision was just one more in a bevy of tenant protections cities and counties had already approved, he said.  “What this order has done is, it has shifted the whole timing to at least 120 days longer,” Woo said, “and that is to the advantage of the tenant.”  Evictions were one way to get tenants to negotiate a payment plan if they were not making rent, Woo said. But rent will be due eventually, and Woo is advising clients to work out a deal with their tenants to pay some rent now.  Some property management companies, however, have tried more aggressive tactics to get their tenants to pay. Greg August, of San Francisco, was laid off in March from his job as a hotel convention waiter and bartender. He’s applied for unemployment but still hasn’t received a payment yet.  The property managers for Normandy Apartments in San Francisco, where August lives, slipped a letter under the door asking for a phone number for tenants’ employers to verify they are unemployed. They also requested a statement, under penalty of perjury, declaring the tenant does not have sufficient savings to cover rent. Attorneys for tenants say that it’s illegal to request those items.  August said the letter made him really nervous.  “I don’t feel like getting up in the morning,” he said. “I’m afraid there will be a knock on my door demanding I pay, and I’m worried about someone approaching me in the laundry room.”  David Kimmel, one of the property managers for Normandy Apartments, said they’ve since agreed to only ask tenants for a letter from their employers stating their hours were reduced or that they were laid off. Then, like many other property managers, he’ll try to work out a payment plan when the tenants can go back to work.  “We’re all in the same boat here,” Kimmel said.   Striking a Deal  A recent survey by Apartment List of nearly 1,000 California residents found nearly 11 percent of tenants were unable to pay any rent in April. Another 14 percent of renters could only make a partial payment.  That’s pretty consistent with what Bill Rosetti, the CEO of J & R Associates, an Oakland-based property management firm, said he’s seeing, with about 10 percent of the tenants in the 700 or 800 units his company owns unable to pay rent this month.  Rosetti is offering his tenants a 60-day deferral on rent and is using that time to figure out a payment plan. A five-decade veteran of the industry, Rosetti has seen recessions come and go. But he’s never experienced anything like this.  “This is way worse,” he said, “because in other cycles, it’s just a small percentage of people — 5 or 10 percent of tenants who can’t pay — but in this circumstance, every one of our tenants is impacted.”  He expects 30 percent of his tenants won’t be able to pay come June if the shelter in place continues, which will make it difficult to keep up with maintenance on the buildings and seismic retrofit work he had planned to do this year.  The burden falls especially hard on small landlords who have just a few properties they rent out.  Andy Kim and his wife purchased a four-unit apartment building in Oakland’s Eastmont neighborhood last year. Most of the tenants use Section 8 vouchers to subsidize their rents, Kim said. And two of them couldn’t make payments this month.  Kim said he has no plans to evict his tenants. But he doesn’t know how long he can cover his mortgage without their rent.  “We can do maybe six months, and then we’ll be forced to sell the building,” he said, adding that the time frame includes getting his bank to agree to a forbearance on the mortgage and taking out loans.  “If I don’t pay for April, May and June, my bank won’t charge interest, but come July, I have to pay in full,” he said. “And if I don’t pay anything until then, I will have a really big bill.”   Ripple Effects  If property owners can’t pay their mortgages or maintain their properties, a housing disaster could be looming.  “It’s not just renters that get hurt by this,” said Carol Galante, faculty director for the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at UC Berkeley and the former federal housing commissioner during the Obama administration. “I think people really don’t understand how much of the rent goes to covering the basics of owning and running a building.”  In a worst case scenario, Galante said that if landlords start missing their payments, we could see an extended drop in rents and home values. On top of that, a spike in unemployment and an uncertain economic forecast could spell bad news for the housing market.  “You don’t want to see a dramatic distressed market,” Galante said. “That’s not good for anybody.”  But just as landlords are feeling uncertain about being able to pay their mortgages, electricity bills and maintenance, tenants are uncertain when they will go back to work — or even if they will go back.  Jamie Bagley always thought hairdressing was a recession-proof profession. Even during the Great Depression, some people were getting their hair done, she said. Now, she’s not sure when she’ll be allowed to go back to work or what the economy will look like when she does.  In the meantime, she doesn’t want to use the little savings she has on rent.   Sponsored  “I feel better hanging on to what I have,” Bagley said, acknowledging that landlords are in a tough spot, too. “I feel like there has to be some sort of debt forgiveness here, otherwise everyone is going to end up in a really bad place.”   Resources for Tenants  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 50, "positive": 46, "negative": 23, "disgust": 4, "joy": 5, "anger": 21, "fear": 15, "trust": 10}, "metadata": ["options", "chinese", "shifts", "evictions", "california", "canceled", "san", "timing", "greg", "hotel", "convention", "unemployment", "employers", "requested", "1,000", "ceo", "obama", "spike", "economic", "forecast", "economy"]}, {"text": " Article content continued  And we’re wondering why it’s proving so hard to get people to take social distancing seriously and stay home?  What’s standing in the way of Ontario ramping up its testing to acceptable levels when other jurisdictions have been able to do so? No, I’m not trolling. I’m asking that as a genuine question. Is it a lack of a proper sense of urgency, as Williams’ and Yaffe’s frustrating tendency to speak in cloudy abstractions might lead one to believe? Is it a lack of provincial lab capacity? If so, why, nearly a week after the health minister declared the state of testing “unacceptable,” has Ontario still not enlisted the help of private labs or academic research labs to pitch in?  It’s easy to get tired of saying the same thing over and over, especially when it seems obvious. We need more testing in Ontario. Clearly. No kidding. Everybody knows. But unless someone keeps saying it, preferably loudly, it isn’t going to happen. We’ve seen that over the past six days. And if it doesn’t happen, we won’t know how far or how fast COVID-19 is spreading. And if we don’t know how far or how fast COVID-19 is spreading, we can’t effectively contain it.  Ironically, it’s very possible that greatly increased testing in Ontario could prove reassuring. As of Monday evening, Canada and South Korea had almost identical COVID-19 case fatality rates (the percentage of people diagnosed with the disease who die) — rates that are quite low compared with other countries. But South Korea had tested a significantly greater proportion of its population. Our true “denominator” (the number of people who have COVID-19) is likely to be much larger than we currently know because we’ve been rationing testing, while presumably our “numerator” (the number of people who have died of COVID-19) is pretty accurate (fortunately things aren’t so bad that deaths are easy to miss). So, ramping up testing could expose Canada as having an even lower rate of death from the disease. Yay?

The two-day summit, the 15th meeting of the forum, brought together leaders of economies that account for about 85 percent of global gross domestic product to discuss the most challenging socioeconomic issues.  Saudi Arabia’s King Salman formally handed over the G20 presidency to Italy, which will chair next year’s leaders’ summit.  Delivering a short speech to mark the occasion, Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said a decision had been taken that the focus of the world’s premier forum for economic cooperation would continue to be “people, planet and prosperity.”  Saudi Arabia's King Salman delivering an address during the second session of the G20 summit, held virtually due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, in Riyadh. (AFP Photo / Saudi Royal Palace / Bandar Al-Jaloud)   ​​​​  He told fellow G20 leaders on the concluding day of the summit: “In order to achieve a safe and sustainable world, we must first restore the balance between people and nature. On this basis, we will then support economic recovery, advance women’s empowerment, and address poverty and inequalities, both new and old, so that no one is left behind.”  The G20 will “facilitate energy transition and combat climate change, tap the immense opportunities stemming from digitalization and enhance the multilateral trade system, based on the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and inclusivity, in order to adopt a true and efficient multilateral approach,” he added.  Conte underscored the importance of a joint effort to move to a better future. “The goal would only be attainable if we work together, united as a global community of intentions, cooperation and solidarity,” he said.  “If there is a very clear lesson we have learned in these recent months, it is that no country can win global challenges alone. This pandemic has clearly shown that we cannot do this alone,” he added.  “In today’s world, which is so interconnected and interdependent, multilateralism is not one of the many options — it is the only sustainable option.”  Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte attending the virtual summit. (Twitter photo)  Conte said he is confident that Italy can rely on the support of all G20 member states during its presidency, which will culminate in the 2021 G20 Leaders’ Summit on Oct. 30-31 in his country.  The G20 presidency rotates between member countries. Each presidency typically concludes with the G20 Leaders’ Summit, a powerful gathering of heads of state that made its debut in 2008. Saudi Arabia became the first Arab country to assume the role in December 2019.  The normal G20 calendar was changed due to restrictions put in place across the forum’s membership in response to the coronavirus pandemic.  Leaders and ministers held virtual meetings since March to coordinate the international response to the crisis and put the global economy on a pathway to recovery.  In his closing remarks at the end of the summit in Riyadh, King Salman said G20 countries have succeeded in sending a message of hope and reassurance to their citizens and the global community.  IN NUMBERS $11 TRILLION - Combined G20 support for individuals, businesses during pandemic.  Referring to the final statement, he said: “It is my honor to announce that the G20 members have adopted this communique. This is what the world has been expecting from us. This achievement today is a culmination of our joint efforts throughout this challenge-fraught year.”  He added: “Our joint and individual actions will be critical in overcoming the immediate global challenge we are facing. Looking forward, through empowering people, safeguarding the planet and shaping new frontiers, we will work on laying the foundations to achieve the main theme of our presidency: Realizing opportunities of the 21st century for all.”  King Salman said the G20 countries have upheld their commitment to working together to confront the pandemic and to safeguard lives and livelihoods.  “We have adopted important policies that will achieve recovery all the way to an economy that is resilient, sustainable, inclusive and balanced,” he added.  “These policies will also maintain the momentum to make the global trade system work for all, and create the conditions to achieve sustainable growth.”  King Salman said although it was the first time Saudi Arabia had held the presidency, it was able “to rise to the challenge” amid the pandemic with the support of member countries.  “Due to its unique stature regionally and internationally, interconnecting three continents and lying at the intersection of emerging and developed markets, the Kingdom will continue to play a key role within the G20 to achieve global cooperation and find solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges,” he added.  The summit’s final statement said: “We, the G20 leaders, meeting for the second time under the Saudi presidency, stand united in our conviction that coordinated global action, solidarity, and multilateral cooperation are more necessary today than ever to overcome the current challenges and realize opportunities of the 21st century for all by empowering people, safeguarding the planet, and shaping new frontiers.”  In his closing remarks to the G20 Riyadh summit, King Salman said although it was the first time Saudi Arabia had held the presidency, it was able “to rise to the challenge” amid the pandemic. (Arab News photo by Basheer Saleh)  The G20 leaders also promised to “spare no effort” to ensure the fair distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and medicines worldwide.  “We are taking immediate and exceptional measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic and its intertwined health, social and economic impacts, including through the implementation of unprecedented fiscal, monetary and financial stability actions,” the statement said.  “We recognize the role of extensive immunization as a global public good. We commend the Saudi presidency for initiating discussions on the need for long-term solutions to address gaps in global pandemic preparedness and response.”  Along with tackling the pandemic, the statement called for protecting the planet and continuing to act against climate change.  “Preventing environmental degradation, conserving, sustainably using and restoring biodiversity, preserving our oceans, promoting clean air and clean water, responding to natural disasters and extreme weather events, and tackling climate change are among the most pressing challenges of our time,” the statement said.  During the Saudi presidency of the G20, 170 meetings were conducted involving ministers of finance, trade and investment, health, education, energy, climate, anti-corruption, agriculture, environment, employment, tourism, digital economy, water and foreign affairs.  In addition, civil society and business groups were represented by eight engagement groups: Business 20, Youth 20, Labour 20, Think 20, Civil 20, Women 20, Science 20 and Urban 20.  They held eight summits and issued eight final statements with a view to bringing civil society and private sector views to the policymaking table.   _______________________   Twitter: @LujainBenGassem  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 19, "positive": 50, "negative": 3, "disgust": 1, "joy": 11, "anger": 7, "surprise": 1, "fear": 6, "trust": 8}, "metadata": ["saudi", "arabia", "italy", "global", "minister", "premier", "economic", "cooperation", "coronavirus", "climate", "united", "challenges", "pandemic", "options", "virtual", "crisis", "economy", "commitment", "solutions", "ensure", "medicines", "unprecedented", "promoting", "sector"]}, {"text": "The Daily Star's FREE newsletter is spectacular!

The naked doctors said that outpatient and general practice care for Covid-19 patients was as important as hospital care, putting them on the frontline in the fight to contain the coronavirus pandemic.  The German medics said their protest was inspired by Alain Colombie, a French doctor who last month posted nude pictures of himself to protest the lack of protective equipment.  He described himself and fellow doctors as “cannon fodder” in the fight against the Covid-19.

Messonnier warned that cities and towns should start planning for “social distancing measures,” like dividing school classes into smaller groups of students or closing schools altogether, The New York Times reported. It was also suggested that meetings and conferences may have to be canceled while businesses needed to make arrangements for employees to work from home.  “The disruption to everyday life might be severe,” Messonnier said. “We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare, in the expectation that this could be bad.”  On Tuesday, Congress challenged Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who heads the U.S. coronavirus task force, about his agency’s preparedness for the coronavirus in the U.S., especially in light of its request for $2.5 billion in emergency funding, which was not viewed as enough to fight the disease.  “It seems to me at the outset that this request for the money … is lowballing it,” Sen.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 26, 2020  On Tuesday during the Democratic presidential debate in South Carolina, candidates criticized the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak but the president quickly defended himself on Twitter.  “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus, including the very early closing of our borders to certain areas of the world. It was opposed by the Dems, ‘too soon’, but turned out to be the correct decision,” Trump wrote.  “Democrats talking point is that we are doing badly. If the virus disappeared tomorrow, they would say we did a really poor, and even incompetent, job. Not fair, but it is what it is. So far, by the way, we have not had one death. Let’s keep it that way!”  On Tuesday, financial markets fell for the second day due to concern over the virus’ economic impact, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down nearly 900 points.  On Wednesday, President Trump accused liberal news networks CNN and MSNBC of playing up fears of the virus to panic markets and promised to address the issue at a news conference at 6 p.m.  “Low Ratings Fake News MSDNC (Comcast) & @CNN are doing everything possible to make the Caronavirus (sic) look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible.

Look at the rapes, and the sexual immorality, and the filth on our TVs and our movies. Folks, the Death Angel may be moving right now across the planet. This is the time to get right with God.”  Wiles noted that he is now enforcing his own self-quarantine by only going from home to his Flowing Streams Church in Florida.  Pastor Stephen Ko of the New York Chinese Alliance Church in New York City, who is also a doctor and formerly an infectious disease expert for the CDC, told NPR that pastors need to be helping to fight the stigma and xenophobia surrounding the coronavirus.  While there are no known cases of the coronavirus in New York City, the church is close to New York University which has a large population of Chinese students and some of their families have been infected with the virus.  “We really have a calling as pastors to care for the vulnerable and also combat stigma and xenophobia. The worst thing we can do now is close our doors to a community that is hurting, that is suffering and is in pain from a crisis that is not only mental, physical but also financial,” Ko said after fielding a barrage of questions from his congregation about the virus recently.  “What we are doing is opening our doors and inviting them into a safe place where they can fellowship and share and pray together,” he added.

The gated society, which has 105 flats, was declared a containment zone on April 3—after a resident was brought dead to the Shanti Mukund Hospital, was tested for Covid-19 and his sample tested positive. The deceased person was on dialysis and used to visit the hospital periodically.  “Four weeks after being sealed under operation Shield, Mayurdhwaj Apartment in East Delhi is being de-contained.

In his de-containment order, Mishra said that medical authorities shall continue follow up operations and the usual lockdown restrictions will remain in place.  The HT, on Tuesday, had reported that Mayurdhwaj Apartments could be one of the four containment zones which could be de-contained by May 3 as fresh cases of Covid-19 had not surfaced.

Mumbai is also the Indian city worst hit by Covid-19, with 4,205 cases recorded until Friday morning. Since April 13 (242 cases in 24 hours), Mumbai has consistently recorded the highest one-day increase among Indian cities, with a single exception: April 17, when it reported 12 cases. Even the exception was because of the exclusion of private lab results and not an actual dip.  Here are Mumbai’s single-day jumps for the last 10 days: April 14: 216; April 15: 140; April 16: 177; April 17: 12; April 18: 183; April 19: 456; April 20: 308; April 21: 419; April 22: 232; April 23: 522; April 24: 242.  What explains the financial capital’s high Covid-19 numbers?  Intensive contact tracing, testing and quarantining of high-risk individuals has contributed to the consistently high numbers, according to the health department officials of Maharashtra and Mumbai “Between 40% and 45% of our total cases are [the result of] efforts at contact tracing and fever camps in containment zones,” said Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health officer of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). According to BMC data on April 24, at least 400,000 people have been screened across 813 containment zones in the city (the number of containment zones increased to 930 on April 23), and at the airport since the Covid-19 outbreak. Simultaneously, Maharashtra’s health department has screened 2.726 million people across the affected districts. Nearly 2 million of these are in Mumbai.  A senior BMC officer who asked not to be named said: “We have to consider the remaining 55% as well. These are coming from the untraced population, but the good thing is that many of them are coming voluntarily [for testing] and it is only later that our health officers realise that they are contacts of existing positive patients.”According to data analysis of positive patients by the Maharashtra Medical Education and Drugs Department (MEDD), 81% of the state’s patients are asymptomatic. Mumbai’s numbers are similar (80%).  Notably, although the cases are rising, the mortality rate in Maharashtra is dipping. On April 12, the city’s mortality rate was 7.41%. This reduced to 4.4% on April 23. On April 12, of the 1,996 patients detected, 148 had succumbed to the infection. Until Thursday night, Maharashtra recorded 6,427 cases with 283 deaths.  Mumbai’s mortality rate has fallen too. On April 12, it was 7.09% (92 deaths and 1298 positives). This came down to 3.97% on April 23 (167 deaths and 4205 positives).  “Identification and quarantining of high-risk contacts has been helpful in keeping Mumbai’s numbers realistic. We will see high figures, but there is no reason to panic because these are expected results of the intensive contact tracing and isolation programme in Maharashtra,” a state government health official said. “Besides, we are aggressively testing a large number of high-risk contacts.”  As of April 23, Maharashtra had conducted 96,369 tests, of which 55,000 (or 57.07%) were in Mumbai alone, according to Pardeshi. Maharashtra has recorded 89,561 negative samples. The remainder are repeat tests.  According to data available with states on per million tests till April 22, Andhra Pradesh leads Indian states with 830 tests per million (41,512 total tests till that day), followed by Tamil Nadu (781 per million, 53,045 total tests) and Maharashtra (665 per million tests). Gujarat is on the fourth spot with 604 per million tests (36,829 total tests).  As of April 23, 11pm, the number of home-quarantined people in the state touched 114,398, while 8,702 were in institutional quarantine, according to data provided by the state health department. In Mumbai, a total of 98,000 people are in government-enforced quarantine — 92,000 at home (in containment zones and hot spots) and 6,000 in institutional quarantine facilities (hospital isolation wards, stadiums, sports complexes and hotels).  Mumbai’s municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi said: “A significant proportion of Mumbai’s cases are of people that have already been quarantined and those that are under observation. The ones that are testing positive, BMC had already anticipated in some measure that they may have the virus.”  “On any given day, between 70-80% of the city’s active cases are asymptomatic,” BMC deputy health officer Shah said on Thursday night, soon after the city’s highest one-day jump was announced. “It is a good thing that so many positive patients are asymptomatic, because they don’t easily spread the disease. They don’t cough or sneeze, and transmit it to someone else. In fact, these patients are adding to our collective immunity. It is the symptomatic ones we have to pay attention to. Not only because they spread it, but because they need medical attention, we need to treat their symptoms before they get worse and change into more complex conditions.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 14, "joy": 3, "negative": 3, "disgust": 2, "positive": 13, "anger": 6, "fear": 7, "trust": 4}, "metadata": ["india", "single-day", "indian", "coronavirus", "tracing", "containment", "corporation", "mortality", "deaths", "isolation", "programme", "gujarat", "quarantine", "sports", "cough", "symptoms"]}, {"text": "New Delhi: A single coronavirus patient flouting lockdown rules and social distancing measures can potentially infect as many as 406 people within a span of 30 days, the Health Ministry quoted a recent study during a press briefing on Tuesday.

The order means that people should not leave their home unless it is absolutely necessary – grocery shopping, for example, or someone who works an essential job.  Social distancing at Lady Bird Lake, Austin (Picture: KXAN/Julie Karam)  At time of writing, there are 98 cases of COVID-19 in Travis County and 133 in total in Central Texas.  KXAN has received a number of questions from viewers about the stay at home order, and under what circumstances they are allowed to leave the home.  Here’s what you can and can’t do while the order is in place.  What does the order actually say?  Under the terms of the order, all non-essential businesses should close. Additionally, all gatherings outside a single household, both private and public, are prohibited.  What you can do during the stay at home order  Health and safety: You are allowed to leave your home to get medicine or anything directly involving the health and safety of anyone in your household, including pets.  Necessary supplies and services: You can go to the grocery store for food, get supplies so you can work from home and buy household consumer products including those that “maintain the safety, sanitation and operation of a residence.”  Outdoor activity: If you practice social distancing and stay at least six feet apart from other people, you are allowed outdoors for exercise. Use of the City of Austin’s playgrounds and exercise equipment stations are prohibited, but trails and parks will remain open.  Certain types of work: You can continue to work if your job is deemed essential.  Take care of others: Anyone that needs to leave their home to take care of a family member or pet at another residence can do so.  What is a non-essential business?

Violations will result in misdemeanor crimes with fines up to $1,000 and six months in jail.  Travis County Judge Sarah Eckhardt said that she expects criminal enforcement not to be needed, saying that enforcement is the “last option” and will only happen in the event of “something egregious.”  What will happen to schools?  School districts in Central Texas previously decided to extend spring break, remaining shut until at least April as the coronavirus pandemic continues to take shape.  And they could remain closed for the rest of the academic year.  Dr Mark Escott, the interim health authority for Austin-Travis County, said that closing all schools for the remainder of the school year is a “basic and necessary step” to prevent more people getting sick.

They are called NHS Nightingale Hospitals, and to date there are seven of them, either open or planned. The first one was announced on 24 March by the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, and was opened almost immediately on 3 April at the London Excel Centre. It has a capacity of some 4,000 beds. The other temporary field hospital sites are in Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Bristol, Exeter, Harrogate, and Washington.  Additionally, over the last month, some 8,000 beds in private hospitals have been re-assigned for Covid-19 use, along with other NHS beds in hospitals all over the UK. By the beginning of April, one third of all non-ICU NHS beds had been converted into potential ICU beds for possible Covid-19 patients. Yet, by 12 April, the London Nightingale had treated just 19 patients, and to date, only 41 patients have been treated.  This sudden blitz is both unusual and unprecedented. We regularly have seasonal infectious illnesses spread throughout the population; in fact in recent years, some of these epidemic diseases were also predicted well in advance. Yet no new mega-hospitals, temporary or otherwise, were ever built to cope with them, nor were they seen to be needed. Why now?  According to the King’s Fund, over the last thirty years, the number of ICU beds has declined, at a time when the population has risen. Over that period, around 34% of general and critical care beds in England have been lost.  Peter Donaghy, an independent data analyst, reports that the UK now comes near the bottom of the world league in the number of hospital beds per head of population: in 2019, and across the four UK nations, he found that there are about 5.7 ICU beds per 100,000 of the population [interpolation of his figures mine]. Cyprus has double that number, Germany has 29, the USA 34, and even Kazakhstan and Mongolia do better than the UK.  Bed shortages are not news, however. In 2008, it was revealed that 32,000 beds of all types had been cut in the decade since 1997, when, ironically, the Blair government came into power on a ticket of increasing the number of hospital beds.  Between 2010 and 2017 there were 70,000 fewer intensive care beds in the UK:  In 2016, the Royal College of Surgeons had complained of chronic bed shortages, so much so that the occupancy rates had gone beyond 89%, when 85% is considered the maximum safe level. This complaint was made just before the British Medical Association chimed in, reporting on the shortage of beds being more severe than in other Western countries, and that such overcrowding can lead to the spread of infections.  And in 2018, the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine (FICM) astonishingly reported that across the UK, 80% of intensive care units were sending patients to other hospitals, either because of a lack of beds or a shortage of staff, particularly nurses.  To cap things off, by 2019, it was being reported by the British Medical Association that ICU beds had begun to be used for patients recovering from routine operations, and that when more emergency beds were needed, a policy of “escalation beds” came into force. The BMA drily reported that there was “little sign of this practice ending”.  When one thinks of the NHS, intensive care is at the heart of most people’s perceptions of it. Yet the decline in the number of ICU beds over the last 30 years is so counterintuitive that it’s as if some monster deus ex machina has intervened and decided not only that the general numbers of hospital beds are of little import, but that intensive care beds are even more expendable. But whatever the case, in the event of a mass epidemic, the consequences of ICU bed shortages were indeed grim prior to 2020.  What official policies have the post-Blair governments been maintaining throughout this decline in the number of ICU beds?  To get a general feel, looking back to 2011, the government published the UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy Paper, outlining what the official response to a hypothetical pandemic should be.  This paper appears to have been written largely in response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak. Its precautionary approach stresses that actions following the emergence of a pandemic, which could occur suddenly at any time:   must be evidence based  be proportional to the level of threat   be flexible  be based on ethical principles.  emergency powers must last no longer than 30 days  Significantly, it states that during any pandemic, it should be “business as usual” and notes that its recommendations are in line with an earlier, 2007, National Framework paper’s “defence in depth” approach to a pandemic.  The Pandemic Preparedness Strategy Paper also makes clear that military personnel are not to be redeployed during a pandemic, but must remain on their normal defence duties. So of course, this means that they were not to be used to help build vast temporary hospitals, transport patients, or manage the public.  In fact, the paper is silent on any hospital bed policies; it takes it as read that there would be enough UK ICU beds for the treatment of pandemic disease patients – for in 2009’s H1N1 swine flu outbreak, generally, hospitals may have just coped with finding enough beds for acute H1N1 patients. There were 540,000 cases of swine flu in England, and 138 fatalities at the time, or 0.026% of those infected.   Exercise Cygnus  Following the publication of the 2011 preparedness paper, however, the number of ICU beds continued to fall. Then, five years later, government held an unusual and secretive event called Exercise Cygnus.  It involved all government departments, all local authorities, and the NHS, right across the UK. Its report has not been published for “national security reasons” and so as not to “frighten the public”. However, according to those with first-hand knowledge of the operation, Cygnus’ script contained a scenario of a patent lack of capacity in ICU beds and personal protective equipment.  Based on its given hypotheses, it predicted that thousands more critical care beds would be required, large parts of the NHS would need to be switched off to redeploy staff, frail patients would be denied care, and mortuaries would be overwhelmed.  Was this just an experiment to see how the public sector actors involved would react to each other, like some kind of Grand Guignol? Did the exercise take its inspiration from the memorably twisted 2012 London Olympics ceremony, in which rows of thousands of NHS patients in hospital beds, in a dark auditorium looking like a Nightingale Hospital, were danced around by strange beasts and actors wearing scrubs?  The modelling of Cygnus was done by Imperial College, London, under the aegis of Neil Ferguson, who is also now doing the modelling of Covid-19.  Tellingly, it is said that last month’s Coronavirus Act, the emergency legislation which underpins the lockdown, is based on his modelling in Exercise Cygnus. Ferguson’s involvement in the Coronavirus crisis does raise other questions – for further coverage see Vanessa Beeley’s article: Who controls the British Government response to Covid–19?  Outside of the strange artificial world of Exercise Cygnus, the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Surgeons continued to complain about bed shortages. So why was there no turnaround policy introduced at least by 2016 after these professional outcries?  The Health Secretary at the time was Jeremy Hunt. Simon Stevens was Chief of NHS England. Both had been involved in cutting bed numbers. Yet, since 2016, and prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, with Sir Simon Stevens still at the helm, there appears to have been no general improvement in ICU bed capacity.  Following Exercise Cygnus, in 2017, the NHS Board published a short internal paper called Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response (EPRR). Its approach is centred on three Acts of Parliament: the Civil Contingencies Act (2004), the NHS Act (2006), and the Health and Social Care Act (2012).  Drawn up by Director of Operations and Information for the NHS Board, Matthew Swindells (sic), it asks the Board to agree that progress had been made in EPRR over the last year, and that the NHS was in a state of pandemic readiness. EPRR was rubber stamped, but as we have seen above, the somewhat rosy, self-congratulatory picture that was approved by the NHS Board was shown to be completely incorrect by Statista in 2017, and later, by the Faculty of Intensive Care in 2018, the BMA in 2019, and Peter Donaghy in 2020.  Back to Exercise Cygnus. This was supposed to be merely a computer simulation. So why would it be an issue of “national security”? Why would it “frighten the public”? Perhaps because it was intended to change the real world into its simulated image?  It’s an uncanny coincidence that, after the Coronavirus pandemic was declared, it was announced that there were not enough ICU beds or personal protective equipment, that NHS staff have been redeployed to other areas, that hospitalised elderly patients have been denied care through the use of “Do Not Resuscitate” orders, and large, temporary, mortuaries have also been built up and down the country, just as in the simulation.  Since the first reported UK Covid-19 case, there has been non-stop media coverage propagandising the numbers of cases and deaths, and its threat. All the while, there have been regular reports that many ICU beds are empty, that beds of other sorts are empty, and that although accident and emergency visits are down, people with serious conditions telephoning the NHS advice and triage number, are being told to “Stay at home – Save the NHS – Save Lives”. Many of these callers have then died for lack of care.  It has also emerged that standards in death registration have been lowered by the government, and that there has been encouragement to register anyone who dies, of any underlying condition, as a Covid-19 death. There need be no objective verification of the existence of Covid-19 to register a death as being caused by it.  Despite these efforts to inflate the death rate, actual mortality rates since the beginning of this crisis do not show that we are in the middle of a pandemic, and actual critical case numbers are not overwhelming the NHS’s depleted intensive care units. In that regard, Covid-19 is not mirroring Exercise Cygnus’ computer-generated scenario.  The government response, however, seems to match it exactly.   ***  SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT MEDIA PLATFORM – BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 22, "positive": 41, "negative": 15, "sadness": 1, "disgust": 3, "joy": 6, "anger": 16, "surprise": 4, "fear": 31, "trust": 13}, "metadata": ["uk", "predicted", "epidemic", "nhs", "matt", "london", "hospital", "sites", "beds", "icu", "infectious", "diseases", "england", "league", "100,000", "germany", "college", "british", "reporting", "shortage", "monster", "pandemic", "precautionary", "defence", "flu", "fatalities", "protective", "sector", "react", "olympics", "coronavirus", "crisis", "hospitalised", "elderly", "media", "mortality"]}, {"text": "Top Democrats in Congress are urging the Trump administration to ease sanctions on Iran, Venezuela, and other countries badly hit by the coronavirus pandemic, citing the need to provide medical supplies and humanitarian support, Foreign Policy reported on Friday.  In a stream of several letters aimed at Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other top U.S. officials, Democratic members of Congress including presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are pushing for the administration to grant clearly outlined waivers from American sanctions.  Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy also spearheaded a call by several Democrats to the Trump administration to ease U.S. sanctions against countries, including Iran and Venezuela, hit hard by coronavirus, saying the measures are hampering the free flow of medicines and other humanitarian supplies to the neediest as the pandemic worsens.  “Helping these nations save lives during this crisis is the right thing to do from a moral perspective, but it is also the right thing to do from a national security perspective,” Murphy wrote in the letter sent Thursday to Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.  “By allowing our sanctions to contribute to the exceptional pain and suffering brought about by the coronavirus outbreaks in both nations, we play into the anti-Americanism.”  The letter was co-signed by several Senate Democrats, including Chris Van Hollen, Tim Kaine, and Patrick Leahy.  An early draft of the letter sent by Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez that was seen by Foreign Policy also calls for a temporary suspension of sanctions, including on the banking and oil sectors that have been heavily targeted since President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018. The letter is expected to be sent to Pompeo and Mnuchin early next week.  Murphy is asking the administration to hold off on the enforcement of sanctions for 90 days that could halt “a rapid humanitarian response” to the spread of the coronavirus in Iran. He also wants the Treasury Department to ease penalties against information technology companies that could provide information on treating or preventing the disease.  Over 35,000 cases of the novel coronavirus have spread across Iran. It has also killed more than 2,500 people.  Amid the crisis, Iran has asked the International Monetary Fund for $5 billion in critical funds and for supplies of masks, respirators, and other medical equipment.  The debate over whether to modify U.S. sanctions on Iran spilled out onto the editorial pages of major American papers this week, with the New York Times editorial board calling for the Trump administration to allow an IMF loan to move forward and for technical assistance. The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board ran a rejoinder on Wednesday.  As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on Tuesday called for an easing of sanctions against countries such as Iran to allow their medical systems to fight the disease and limit its global spread.  Michelle Bachelet said humanitarian exemptions to sanctions measures should be authorized for essential medical equipment and supplies to avoid the collapse of any national healthcare system.

The tool is being tested by University of Tor Vergata in Rome and has already been tested on 300 individuals, and has yielded 98 per cent accurate results.  According to the team from DY Patil Institute of Bio Technology and Bio Informatics, Mumbai, the tool is based on a voice-based diagnosis through an app.  The team includes bioinformatics students--Rashmi Chakraborty, Priyanka Chauhan and Priya Garg.  \"While several foreign universities are trying to launch a Voice-Based AI tool for COVID-19 detection, this Indian tool is fully functional and currently in use in Italy to successfully identify COVID-19 patients. The students have a full-fledged working software with a rich database of patients and healthy samples. This tool is being currently used by the University of Rome to detect COVID patients with 98 per cent accuracy,\" professor Santosh Bothe, who supervised the project, told PTI.  \"As someone speaks to the microphone on the app, the tool breaks down the voice in multiple parameters such as frequency and noise distortion. These values are then compared to a normal person's values and the patented technique then determines if the patient is positive or not,\" he added.  A team at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, is also working on a diagnostic tool based on analysis of cough and respiratory sounds.  According to Giovanni Saggio, Professor at the Rome university's Engineering department, the audio-based disease diagnosis tool can find coronavirus from timbre of the voice.  \"Each human voice has 6300 parameters, and only a few units, less than a dozen, specifically characterize individuals. The human ear, apart from colds, is not able to distinguish them, but artificial intelligence does. Each one of our internal organs is sort of a resonator, so if we have a problem with our lungs or our heart, this is reflected in our voice,\" Saggio told PTI.  \"The same person has one voice when they are healthy, and another if they have a pathology. Since the coronavirus compromises lungs and airwaves, the voice is definitely affected. The current novel coronavirus cases could be picked this way,\" he added.  Student researcher, Priya Garg believes this tool can be of great impact in doing the first level of screening to identify positives and only those who tested positive can go for the lab tests.  \"This can reduce the current bottleneck on the medical infrastructure, help the government to identify hot spot regions in advance through location tracking integration and is possibly the best way to reach out to the remotest part of India by testing through a smartphone.  \"When the country's medical infrastructure and the whole medical community is under immense pressure, this might be a great solution to reach patients remotely, without the risk of exposure, both to the patient and the lab personnel. While we don't propose the tool to replace current testing methods, the simplicity of this test can be used to screen and identify the COVID-19 positive cases at a very early stage of inception and hence contain the spread further,\" she added.  COVID-19 has killed at least 1,31,319 people around the world, with Europe accounting for more than two-thirds of the deaths. Europe has reported 88,716 deaths, while the United States has the single highest toll at 26,950. The US is followed by Italy with 21,645 deaths, Spain with 18,579 and France with 17,167.

(Sarahbeth Maney/The Flint Journal via AP)  Calvin Munerlyn was shot Friday at the store just north of downtown Flint a short time after telling Sharmel Teague’s daughter she had to leave because she lacked a mask, according to Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton.  Teague, 45, argued with Munerlyn, 43, before leaving. Two men later came to the store.  Teague; her husband, Larry Teague, 44; and Ramonyea Bishop, 23; are charged with first-degree premeditated murder and gun charges.  Larry Teague also is charged with violating Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s executive order mandating that all customers and employees must wear face coverings inside grocery stores, Leyton said.  Larry Teague (Genesee County Prosecutor’s Office)  Witnesses identified Bishop as the man who shot Munerlyn in the back of the head, Leyton said.  Sharmel Teague has been arrested. Police were looking for her husband and son.  No information has been released about the daughter, who has not been charged in the shooting.  “It is important that the governor’s order be respected and adhered to, and for someone to lose their life over it is beyond comprehension,” Leyton said earlier Monday in a statement.

They don’t necessitate acts of defiance, and we simply cannot devolve into an us versus them mentality.”  About 150 people attended a candlelight vigil Sunday night.

Here's what that actually means. USA TODAY  The fallout from the coronavirus continues to reverberate across the nation and the world. At least 20 states have closed or made plans to close all schools, keeping more than a quarter of U.S. schoolchildren out of the classroom. Saturday evening it was announced that President Donald Trump has tested negative for the coronavirus. Large grocery chains are trimming their open hours to make more time for cleaning. All of Europe – including the United Kingdom and Ireland – is now under U.S. travel restrictions.  Trump spoke at the White House with his virus task force one day after declaring the coronavirus pandemic to be a national emergency.  Some highlights of the press conference:  Trump praised a late night deal between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that would provide economic relief to Americans affected by the crisis and provide for free testing for the virus.  The U.S. is extending its Europe travel ban to cover the United Kingdom and Ireland so that residents of those countries will not be allowed to travel to the U.S. for 30 days, beginning Monday.  Trump said the administration is considering some domestic travel restrictions from areas hard hit by the pandemic.  At least 50 people have died in the U.S., where there have been more than 2,100 confirmed cases of the virus. Worldwide, cases were nearing 150,000 on Saturday with more than 5,500 deaths.

The president’s physician, Sean P. Conley, said in a memo released by the White House that Trump decided to get tested on Friday after they conferred about the matter.  Trump announced at a press briefing on Saturday that he had been tested for coronavirus following his recent exposure to two Brazilian officials who later tested positive for the virus.  Trump, who said his temperature was “totally normal,” told reporters he took the test Friday night but that it would take a few days to get the results because the test was sent to a lab.  Trump took the test around the time a White House doctor issued a statement saying the president does not need to get tested or self-quarantined for coronavirus because he had not exhibited any symptoms.  — Michael Collins, Courtney Subramanian, Deirdre Shesgreen  Stores trimming hours so they can clean  Retailers across the nation are trimming store hours to focus on deep cleanings and to restock store shelves.

Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said in a statement Saturday that in-person early voting, which began statewide March 2, will be halted and the election will be moved to May 19, when Georgia’s other 2020 primary elections are being held.  Election officials said in addition to the safety of the public, one of the biggest considerations was the risk the virus posed to poll workers, who are often older.  On Friday, Louisiana became the first state to push back its presidential primaries.   — Associated Press  Soldiers returning from 9 months in Afghanistan now under quarantine  More than 300 paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division’s 3rd Brigade Combat Team started a 14-day quarantine Saturday after being deployed for nine months in Afghanistan.  The move is a precautionary measure, division officials said.  Col. T.J. Rainsford, a spokesman for the 18th Airborne Corps, said that as of Saturday morning, there were no positive cases of the new coronavirus at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the largest Army installation in the country.  The quarantining of the soldiers was directed by the Army, which said that troops leaving areas that are labeled Level 2 or higher by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should stay in quarantine for two weeks.  While in quarantine, the paratroopers will be monitored for health and get appropriate medical treatment, according to the division.  – Rachael Riley and Steve DeVane, The Fayetteville (N.C.) Observer  At least 20 states close all schools  Twenty states and a number of large urban school districts – including Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest – are shutting down all K-12 schools as part of a sweeping attempt to contain the spread of the coronavirus.  Alabama, Alaska, Delaware, Florida, Kentucky, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin have made plans to close all schools.  In addition to Los Angeles, major metropolitan districts in Atlanta, Austin, Denver, Miami-Dade County, San Francisco, San Diego and Washington, D.C., have also shuttered. A growing number of smaller districts around the country have also chosen to close.  According to a count updated mid-afternoon Friday by Education Week magazine, about a quarter of American schoolchildren had been or were scheduled to be affected by a school closures – and that was before some states announced their actions.  The magazine said at least 46,000 schools were closed, are scheduled to close, or were closed and later reopened, affecting at least 21 million students.  Customs intercepts fake virus tests  U.S. Customs and Border Protection is advising Americans to be aware of “bogus home testing kits for sale either online or in informal direct to consumer settings” after officers at Los Angeles International Airport intercepted a package containing suspected counterfeit COVID-19 test kits arriving from the United Kingdom, the agency said Saturday.  The officers discovered six plastic bags containing various vials while conducting an enforcement examination Thursday. The vials were filled with a white liquid and labeled “Corona Virus 2019nconv (COVID-19)” and “Virus1 Test Kit,” the agency said. The agency turned the shipment over to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for analysis.   – Grace Hauck  Trump adds UK, Ireland to travel restrictions  Trump on Saturday said the United Kingdom and Ireland will be added to the Europe travel restrictions that went into effect late Friday. This means residents of those countries will not be allowed to travel to the United States for 30 days beginning Monday.  U.S. residents and legal permanent residents won't be banned but they will face airport screenings upon their return and will be asked to self quarantine for 14 days.  In response to the broadened ban and the resulting falloff in travel demand, airlines are likely to sharply cut flights between the U.S. and London and Ireland. Delta Air Lines and American Airlines suspended all flights between the U.S. and the 26 European countries covered by the initial ban.  Meanwhile, Trump said he is considering domestic travel restrictions \"specifically from certain areas\" after the Pentagon restricted service members' domestic travel. \"If you don't have to travel I wouldn't do it ... we want this thing to end.\" Read more here.   – Dawn Glibertson   Census deadline could change  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Saturday the deadline to respond to the 2020 Census is still the end of July, but that could change if the coronavirus crisis impacts the national operation.  Civil rights groups and community activists had called for the Census Bureau to consider extending the July 31 deadline as concerns increase about the impact of the outbreak on the decennial count.  Ross said the agency has a $2 billion contingency budget and will adapt its plans to deal with the coronavirus crisis, including deadlines. Households have until July 31 to respond to the population survey.  Civil rights groups said they’re worried about the safety of census takers and are concerned communities that have long been under counted may not respond.  Census officials have been scrambling to meet deadlines, including recruiting and hiring thousands of workers who will knock on the doors of people who don’t respond to the survey. The deadlines are critical as the Census is required to provide information to Congress. That information is used to distribute billions in federal funds and determine the number of members of Congress for each state.   — Deborah Berry  NCAA had, spent rainy-day fund  The cancellation of the NCAA’s Division I men’s and women’s basketball tournaments is likely to wreak financial havoc on colleges and universities that depend on the millions of dollars in revenue the games bring in.  It turns out the NCAA did have the foresight to begin planning for an unknown catastrophic event that would threaten its biggest and most lucrative event.  By 2014, the association had accumulated a nearly $400 million cushion as a hedge against a massive loss of revenue from the tournament.  Then, at the direction of its governing board of college presidents, the NCAA distributed that money to schools to help them with increasing costs and spent it on their behalf in other ways, including a $208.7 million legal settlement.  “The NCAA will be fine,” said Barbara Osborne, a sports administration professor at the University of North Carolina. “But all schools will be having huge belt tightening because of this.” Read more here.   – Steve Berkowitz  Mnuchin says more bills coming on cruise, hotel, airline assistance  Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin praised the legislation passed by the House early Saturday morning and said the next round of legislation would address the cruise, hotel and airline industries.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday in a letter to lawmakers the House would start work on a third legislative package to \"protect the health, economic security and well-being of the American people.\"  The House passed a bill early in the morning to provide paid sick leave and free coronavirus testing, and Mnuchin told reporters the bill \"delivers on what the president announced in his speech the other night.\"  \"People who need to be quarantined, we want them at home and we don't want them to fear not getting paid,\" he continued.  Mnuchin said there was language agreed to with Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy that did not make it into the final bill, \"so there will be a technical correction Monday morning.\"  - Nicholas Wu and Courtney Subramanian  CLOSE President Donald Trump declared a national emergency, a move that would enable federal officials to direct billions of dollars to fighting the virus. USA TODAY  Trump: Federal Reserve should be ‘more proactive’  Trump again slammed the Federal Reserve on Saturday, saying the central bank hasn’t done enough to calm financial markets amid the coronavirus pandemic.  At an unusual Saturday news conference, Trump offered praise to Congress, the American people and even the press for their response to the coronavirus scare. But the Fed – one of his favorite targets – got only presidential scorn.  “I thought the Fed would be and should be much more proactive,” Trump said. “Our Fed is following.”  Trump is frequently critical of the Fed and Chairman Jerome Powell, whom he appointed to the chairmanship in 2017. Trump claims that interest rate hikes have slowed economic growth.  The Fed cut interest rates two weeks ago in a rare emergency move in response to the threat the coronavirus posed to the economy and financial markets. But Trump thinks it should be doing more.  “Our Fed is not doing what they should be doing,” he said, arguing the U.S. shouldn’t have a rate higher than competitor nations such as Germany and Japan.  Asked whether he intends to fire Powell, Trump said he has the authority to do so, “but I’m not doing it.”   – Michael Collins  France closes all schools, restaurants, Eiffel tower; Spain locks down 46M citizens, Israel bans gatherings  France and Spain followed Italy's lead with tough new measures, leaving the Eiffel Tower and Louvre shuttered and 46 million Spanish citizens in a lockdown.  Italy also invoked sharp new measures, including closing playgrounds and parks.  France's orders closed cafes, restaurant and cinemas. The government has banned all gatherings of more than 100 people, ordered all schools closed and asked companies to allow workers to stay home.  In declaring a two-week state of emergency Saturday, Spain prepared to close all schools, universities, restaurants, bars and hotels nationwide.  Spain’s declaration comes as coronavirus cases soared to over 5,700 with 136 deaths. The declaration also would allow the government to limit free movement, confiscate goods and take over control of industries and private facilities, including private hospitals.  Residents of Madrid, which has around half the infections, and northeastern Catalonia awoke to shuttered bars and restaurants and other non-essential commercial outlets as ordered by regional authorities.  In Italy, mayors of many cities, including Rome and Milan, decided to close public playgrounds and parks as European countries fashion different polices to try to combat the spread of the virus.  Elsewhere, Denmark and Poland became the latest countries to shut their borders to most travelers.  Israel on Saturday banned gatherings of more than ten people and ordered that restaurants and movie theaters close. Supermarkets, banks, pharmacies and gas stations are allowed to remain open.

Department of Transportation issues emergency declaration  Truckers hauling loads of emergency supplies and commercial drivers transporting relief personnel due to the coronavirus outbreak will no longer be subject to federal rules regarding maximum number of work hours, the Department of Transportation said Saturday in issuing a national emergency declaration.  The declaration waives otherwise strict rules governing driving and rest period times, intended to reduce highway deaths. It is intended to cut red tape that otherwise might hold up emergency relief, officials said.  It will apply to drivers hauling critical medical supplies like masks, hand sanitizer, soap and disinfectants needed by health care workers. Also mentioned are sanitation supplies for communities. Included, too, is food for emergency restocking of stores, workers and supplies for temporary housing or quarantine facilities related to COVID-19 and transportation of medical or other emergency-service personnel.  \"This declaration will help America’s commercial drivers get these critical goods to impacted areas faster and more efficiently,\" said Jim Mullen, acting administrator of the department's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.  The order requires truckers be allowed to rest for a minimum of 10 consecutive hours if they say they need time off before returning to work at the terminal or their normal reporting location. Normally, truckers are subject to elaborate rules that limit them to 11 hours of driving a day during a 14-hour period after 10 hours of rest.  The administration's order includes stipulations to prevent abuse. It won't apply to commercial deliveries, for instance, or to mixed loads – items both considered part of the emergency relief shipped along with general cargo.   - Chris Woodyard  Ahead of Pence briefing, White House checks temperatures for those around Trump, Pence  Ahead of a press briefing Saturday with Vice President Mike Pence, a member of the White House Physicians Office took the temperature of reporters and television crews.  \"Out of an abundance of caution, temperature checks are now being performed on any individuals who are in close contact with the President and Vice President,\" said White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere.

Civil rights groups and lawmakers – already concerned about health disparities in communities of color – worry there may also be a slow response to the coronavirus crisis, including access to tests and treatment. Democrats and advocates have criticized the Trump administration for not doing enough to address the crisis.  “I’m extremely concerned that our lack of preparedness ... would result in a Katrina-like response where there was vast inequities between who receive services and who did not receive services and that line was drawn based on race, primarily, and class,’’ Derrick Johnson, president of the national NAACP, told USA TODAY.  Former President George W. Bush and his administration came under fire in 2005 for the slow response to Hurricane Katrina. The hurricane left more than 1,800 dead in the region and devastated communities, many of them African American.  The tele-town hall scheduled for 8 p.m. EST will focus on how to identify symptoms and how to prepare. It aims to provide listeners with information on “how to navigate in this current reality,’’ said Johnson.  You asked, we're answering:Specific answers to readers' coronavirus questions  Sen. Kamala Harris, a Democrat from California, who will be part of the town hall,said she’s concerned about the impact of the coronavirus on communities of colors and about whether there are enough tests. “As it connects to every other public health issue our folks are the last to have access to what is needed to allow them to be diagnosed and treated,” she said.  Johnson said while all communities will be impacted, he’s worried about different response in communities of color.  “I think our president has undermined the ability of our medical health professions both in government and outside of government from implementing an aggressive plan to address this pandemic,’’ said Johnson, adding that Trump hasn’t listened to medical professionals. “He is the problem on top of the problem.”  Separately, members of the congressional Tri-Caucus, called on health officials to provide information in languages other than English.

He also highlighted a new one-time payment being offered to Ontario families as part of the province's COVID-19 response.  Premier Doug Ford said this morning Ontario has about a week's supply of masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) in its stockpile after the U.S. blocked a shipment of three million masks to the province yesterday.  Speaking with Global News Toronto, Ford said a shipment of three million medical masks bound for Ontario was stopped at the border on Sunday.  “We had three million masks stopped at the border this weekend coming up to Canada. That's unacceptable. Absolutely unacceptable that they're doing this,” Ford said in an interview with Global News.  This blocked shipment means Ontario only has about a week's supply of masks and other PPE for health care workers.  Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump used the 1950 Defense Production Act to direct the government to buy up N95 respirator masks from 3M and its subsidiaries, and asked the Minnesota company to stop exporting masks outside the U.S.  The company disagreed with this, saying the consequences could have \"significant humanitarian implications.\"  Ford said Canada is working with the U.S. to try to come up with some kind of exemption to the U.S. move, so PPE can still flow into Canada from south of the border.  Today, Ford said Ontario is doing everything it can to source PPE.  \"Our supplies are strained right at this moment. As demand escalates, getting supplies from other countries is becoming increasingly difficult,\" he said.  \"We are doing everything in our power, exhausting every avenue available to us, turning over every single stone. But the hard truth is our supplies in Ontario are getting very low.\"  This makes it all the more important for the public to follow the direction of medical experts, the premier said: stay home; go out only when you need to; don't gather in groups bigger than five people.  Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, is now recommending people wear masks, even homemade ones, when out in public, particularly when going into stores.  While homemade masks offer minimal protection for contracting the virus, they are effective at preventing symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, from spreading the virus.  Today Ford also unveiled the Support for Families initiative, a one-time financial assistance the province is providing to families of young children and families of children with developmental disabilities.  The new initiative is a one-time payment to families of $200 per child 0 to 12 years of age, and $250 for those 0 to 21 years of age with special needs.  \"During this extraordinary time, we're doing everything we can to support parents to keep everyone safe and ensure our children continue to learn and stay mentally active,\" said Ford.  \"This one-time funding will allow parents to access additional tools for our kids to use while at home and studying remotely. I want to remind everyone to stay at home and only go out if absolutely necessary. It's the only way we are going to defeat this terrible virus.\"  Families can complete a simple online application at Ontario's Support for Families web page here (https://www.ontario.ca/page/get-support-families) to access this financial support.  If you are already receiving Support for Parents payments (https://www.ontario.ca/page/education-contract-talks-stay-updated) through direct deposit, you will be automatically eligible for this financial support and do not need to submit a new application.  E-learning for Ontario students has also begun.  Public schools will remain closed to teachers until May 1 and to students until May 4. Private schools, licensed child care centres and EarlyON programs will also remain closed until April 13, according to the Declaration of Emergency, which only allows closures to be extended for one 14-day period at a time.  Ontario launched the second phase of Learn at Home (https://www.ontario.ca/page/learn-at-home) and Apprendre Ã la maison, a new online portal that provides resources for families so students can continue their education while schools are closed due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation.

The scenes that met them were nothing short of devasting. Despite the British Army’s best efforts, more than 13,000 of the at least 50,000 prisoners died within weeks of liberation from rampant disease. Many of those who survived were children, with no-one left in the world to look out for them.  Mala Tribich MBE always recalls the moment of liberation. Inmates who could hardly shuffle, were running. Lying in her bunk, suffering with typhus, she was incredulous. Many, looking back, speak of not understanding what liberation meant at all. Starved, alone and on the brink of collapse, there was not a sudden or spontaneous celebration.  Freedom means something very different when you have nowhere to go. They knew the Germans had gone and the British had arrived, but not how that would change their lives. For those who survived as young children, they knew no different but a life under Nazi rule. Perhaps the same could be said of when the Jewish people were liberated from slavery in Egypt. So many generations had suffered that they knew not what they went towards, only what they gladly left behind.  Many of those who survived the Holocaust were the only surviving members of their families, so they came together to create their own sort of family. And to a large extent it was the British who enabled that. Whether it was The Boys who came to Lake Windermere, or those who banded together in the Bergen-Belsen Displaced Persons’ Camp, they recall British support as they united towards a revival of Jewish life, culture and religion.  We always knew that the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Belsen would be different to all those which have already passed. As time moves further on, the Holocaust moves from living history to just history, making our mission to educate all the more pressing. Some of our beloved survivors, who did so much to tell the world of what they had experienced, have passed away. I think of Gena Turgel with particular affection, who meant so much to me and inspired all those she met.  But, none of us could have foreseen the circumstances in which we will mark this momentous occasion; the voices of those we need to hear the most are quieter than we’d hope as survivors are rightly shielding themselves from the devastating affects of COVID-19.  At the Holocaust Educational Trust, we have been working hard to innovate through online and digital resources, and to ensure that even during lockdown we can engage, educate and discuss questions of faith, hope and resistance. And whilst visits to Belsen were cut short, we are glad that nearly 1000 students and teachers were able to visit the camp, and teachers across the country have accessed educational resources.  We have also been encouraging our support network to #SendSomeLove to Holocaust survivors who do so much for our cause. It’s been heart-warming to see messages pour in and their messages to us have been equally uplifting. They of all people know about hardship, but the swell of support and love for them has been heart-warming. In tough times, the best of humanity often shines through.  Susan Pollack MBE speaks of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen and the British soldier who lifted her up and put her on a stretcher, the first act of kindness and gentleness she’d seen since the Nazis invaded Hungary and her life changed forever. At this difficult time, it is right that we recognise the bravery and kindness of those who are sacrificing their personal safety for the good of others. And as we mark Pesach, and the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen, we should take time to reflect on, remember and be thankful for the freedoms we share. Let us celebrate, virtually with loved ones, and together, as a community.

The 36-year-old posted an open letter on his Instagram page, captioning the post 'I swear, I'm fine', as he remembered his 'sweet' relative.  His post gained thousands of reactions in minutes, including one from fellow comedian Amy Schumer, as he advised people to watch what they eat and of the dangers of 5G.  'My grandmother passed away from the coronavirus. I'm doing ok, considering,' Che - who is based in New York – began.  Michael Che (left) revealed on Instagram Monday that his grandmother died from coronavirus on Sunday night. But comedian Amy Schumer (right)criticized him after he referenced the origin of coronavirus being someone who wanted to try eating a bat  'I just refuse to believe I lost my sweet, beautiful grandma because some n***a ate a bat one time. I'm sorry,' Che wrote online after saying he was sticking with the theory 5G has been harmful and brought on the pandemic  Amy Schumer commented: 'I'm so sorry honey. They don't eat bats because they're adventurous. They eat them because they are poor. At its most basic level this is about imbalance of wealth'  New York is so far the hardest hit state in the US with over 130,680 cases and 4,758 deaths as of Monday afternoon.  Opening up that he was 'angry she had to go through all the hurt and pain alone', Che was honest about an array of complex feelings he had regarding his loved one's passing, considering other people were going through similar grief in the world right now.  Touching on a theory that the virus was caused by mass introduction of 5G to the world's major cities, he admitted that his belief in the conspiracy in part is helping him deal with the grief.  'I just refuse to believe I lost my sweet, beautiful grandma because some n***a ate a bat one time. I'm sorry,' Che wrote online. 'Even if that is in fact how that all started. I'm just not willing to accept that right now. I need a better story. I'm sorry.  'I just wanna tell everybody to watch what you're eating at this time. And not just the 'n***as that still eat bats.'  Experts have advised that vitamins B, C, D and the likes of Zinc and magnesium can help ward off viruses and repair the immune system after illness.  The Saturday Night Live star advised followers to increase their intake of vitamins in order to help fight the virus  He warned not to snap up offers of free fast food delivery during the coronavirus pandemic  Che added: 'OK maybe you don't sell us bat but then maybe you do! We don't know where the f**k they're getting all this dollar meat from. It ain't the butcher!'  In keeping with health advisories, Che asked his followers to ensure their water intake is up, that they are taking the required vitamins and that they 'eat dark leafy greens'. He continued: 'And all that other good stuff I never thought twice about up until the last two weeks so you can boost your immune system and help fight this awful virus in the unfortunate event you get it'.  Che also shared what he deemed another conspiracy theory as he warned against taking up offers of free delivery from fast food companies during the pandemic. Many brands were urged to get rid of their fees to encourage social distancing while restaurants are closed for dine in amid lockdowns.  But the SNL star believes it will only contribute to underlying health issues such as diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure.  Medical experts and congress members last month urged the CDC to start looking into the correlation between race and the COVID-19 death rate, as data has indicated in the likes of Louisiana and Michigan. Che suggested fellow black people may have a higher risk of dying from the disease as he wrote on Instagram: 'Why is it that black people are some of the most athletic people on the planet yet we lead the world in diabetes and heart disease? How is that possible? C-o-n-s-p-i-r-a-c-y that's how.'  'I see fast food companies offering to deliver food during the pandemic?! When their food is killing us in the first place!' he continued. 'OK maybe you don't sell us bat but then maybe you do! We don't know where the f**k they're getting all this dollar meat from. It ain't the butcher!'  Later in the post after he shared a positive message that those who had lost loved ones would get through it, Che reverted back to the bat.  Che encouraged followers to stop watching Tiger King on Netflix and to start reading up on how to boost their immune system  Above shows the number of coronavirus cases and deaths in New York as of Monday afternoon  'Can you believe that n***a ate a bat though? That's so f**king infuriating. I bet somebody tried to warn him like \"that bat smells a little funny\" and his dumba*s was probably like 'ehhhhh, what's the worst that could happen?'  His comments garnered a response from fellow comedian Amy Schumer – who recently shared a video of herself waving to her father from the street beneath his nursing home window as they adhered to social distancing measures.  'I'm so sorry honey. They don't eat bats because they're adventurous,' Schumer commented. 'They eat them because they are poor. At its most basic level this is about imbalance of wealth.'  Elsewhere in his post, Che encouraged the media to share more information about what foods to avoid and how to better prepare one's immune system in the case someone should get the virus.  Referencing the popular new Netflix series Tiger King, the stand-up comedian added: 'If we can spend 6 hours watching some tweaker raise tigers, then we can spend a few minutes finding out how not to poison ourselves. Right? Right.'

For the rest with symptoms, the best medication could be paracetamol, as this controls fever and pain. In order to help rebuild the immune system post-virus, experts recommend antioxidants which can be obtained from a variety of foods, such as berries, garlic and onion. Vitamin Injections London founder Bianca Estelle has recommended cocktails of vitamins and minerals, intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) injection, as an alternative to oral supplements which can be harmful to the stomach in high doses. The UK-based clinic administers high doses (dependent on factors including age and health condition. The antiviral concoctions are also great for preventing free radical damage and reducing inflammation caused by viruses. According to Chinese data, one in five patients with COVID-19 may be ill enough to need medical intervention. File image B VITAMINS B Complex vitamins also help boost the immune system after a viral infection. 'Specifically B6,' Estelle says. 'It gives cells the energy they require to communicate effectively and function.' B6 supports red blood cell production and reduces inflammation. It cannot be made by the body naturally. VITAMIN C Coronavirus victims have reported symptoms of fatigue, body aches, fever, coughing and sneezing. Vitamin C is a natural antioxidant that protects the body against the effects of harmful agents (internal and external) and can negatively affect metabolic processes, leading to tiredness and fatigue. Chinese studies have been treating some infected people with high doses of vitamin C due to its anti-viral properties. Since it has a very low toxicity level, there is no risk of damaging vital organs, as long as the correct dose is administered for an individual as recommended by a health expert. VITAMIN D According to a WHO study on respiratory tract infections, 'Vitamin D deficiency may affect the immune system as vitamin D plays an immunomodulation role, enhancing innate immunity by up-regulating the expression and secretion of antimicrobial peptides, which boosts mucosal defenses'. Magnesium is also found in vegetables, milk and fish (pictured) According to a World Health Organization study on respiratory tract infections, 'Vitamin D deficiency may affect the immune system as vitamin D plays an immunomodulation role, enhancing innate immunity by up-regulating the expression and secretion of antimicrobial peptides, which boosts mucosal defenses'. Airborne illnesses such as coronavirus can get into the system via mucous membranes; eyes, nose and mouth. Estelle hails the antibacterial and antimicrobial properties of D3, otherwise known as the 'sunshine vitamin'. Darker skin tones have more difficulty obtaining the benefits of vitamin D but slow-release adhesive skin patches provide 12 hours of continuous D3 supplementation, delivered directly into the bloodstream. 'The Vitamin D Shot is a safe treatment,' VitaminInjections.co.uk states. 'Rarely, however, Vitamin D injections can lead to a number of side effects - the most common of which are stomach discomfort and nausea.' Darker skin tones have more difficulty obtaining the benefits of vitamin D but slow-release adhesive skin patches provide 12 hours of continuous D3 supplementation MAGNESIUM Magnesium helps reduce inflammation in tissues and regulates the immune system response. Notably it helps keep organs, bones and nerves healthy. Found in vegetables, milk, fish, pulses, and grains, about 15 percent is absorbed via oral supplement and it's absorbed at a much higher rate via IV. ZINC Zinc helps flush out damaged cells and fight infection. According to VitaminInjections.co.uk, the trace mineral, stimulates the activities of nearly one hundred enzymes and is necessary for the healthy functioning of the body. Individuals lacking in this nutrient may be more susceptible to illness, meaning that an adequate amount of Zinc should ideally be present in the body’s cells. Zinc is recommended for supplementing pre-existing deficiencies in order to enhance the body’s natural ability to defend itself against foreign invaders.

Over the past few weeks, the Trump Administration has ramped up its rhetoric against China, accusing it of being non-transparent and holding it responsible for the spread of coronavirus across the world.  The virus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan before turning out to be a pandemic,  China spun that virus. They hid it for six weeks. They could have contained it in Wuhan. They didn't. They seeded the world with this, with hundreds of thousands of Chinese getting on aircraft to Milan, to New York and other places, Peter Navarro, director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing and National Defense Production Act Policy Coordinator, told Fox  During that six-week period, what they did was they vacuumed up the world for personal protective equipment, over two billion masks, depriving public healthcare workers around the world from the defences they need. And today China's profiteering basically from this situation, he said.  Navarro was responding to a question on comments made by Microsoft founder Bill Gates that it is not the time to blame China for this.  It's not time to talk about that. This is the time to take the great science we have, the fact that we're in this together, you know, fix testing, treatments and get that vaccine. Minimise the trillions of dollars and many things that you can't even dimensionalise in economic terms that are awful about the situation that we're in. So, that's a distraction, Gates told CNN in an interview.  I'm all for innovation, but we have to hold China accountable. And now China is even flooding us with these bad tests,\" Navarro said.  \"So, Mr Gates and I will differ on the need to hold China accountable. That's certainly the case because the Chinese Communist Party basically inflicted this virus on the world. And we should never forget that here in America, Navarro said.  Navarro said that while the US economy is shut down because of the coronavirus, the Trump administration is engaged in the most rapid industrial mobilisation that the country has had since World War II.  Struggling to scale up the testing, India has also imported the antibody kits from China.  India's apex health research body ICMR on Monday asked states to stop using the COVID-19 rapid antibody test kits procured from two Chinese companies and return them to be sent back to the suppliers.  In an advisory sent to chief secretaries of all states and Union Territories on Monday, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said it \"evaluated the kits of Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech and Zhuhai Livson Diagnostics in field conditions. The results have shown wide variation in their sensitivity, despite early promise of good performance for surveillance purpose\".

(AP) - North Carolina reported its first two COVID-19 deaths on Wednesday as local governments in several higher-populated areas ordered their residents to stay at home. Gov. Roy Cooper says additional state directives are coming to slow the virus spread.  Cooper announced the coronavirus-related deaths were a person from Cabarrus County and another person from Virginia who was traveling through the state. The Cabarrus County patient was over 70 years old with underlying conditions, while the Virginia patient was over 60, according to a news release, which did not include further details about them.  The deaths came as overall positive cases of the virus reached more than 500 statewide, according to a state tally Wednesday. About 30 people were hospitalized, authorities said, and some were in critical condition.  “Today is a stark reminder that we must take this disease seriously - all of us, young and old, employers and employees,” Cooper said at a news conference while asking for privacy for the families of those who died. “This virus can be deadly, and that’s why our daily lives have had to change so dramatically. I know it’s hard, but it’s necessary.”  More local governments announced stay-at-home orders on Wednesday, including the cities of Durham and Winston-Salem; Buncombe County in the Asheville area; and Greensboro and surrounding Guilford County. Mecklenburg County announced one on Tuesday that takes effect Thursday morning.  Wake County, which includes Raleigh and ranks No. 2 in population behind Mecklenburg, planned to roll out a similar order very soon, said county commission Chairman Greg Ford.  North Carolina government has not issued a statewide shelter-in-place order but has gradually reduced allowable gathering sizes, ordered some nonessential businesses to close starting Wednesday and shuttered K-12 schools until mid-May. Trade groups representing hospitals and doctors have written Cooper asking him to issue more statewide restrictions.  Without giving specifics, Cooper said further guidance and orders would be upcoming. He urged people to stay at home and businesses to get their telecommuting options in order.  “Local communities are doing what they think is right and I understand that. It’s important for (state officials) to make sure we are deliberate and that we get this right,” Cooper said. “We will be issuing additional orders soon.”  Durham Mayor Steve Schewel said at a Wednesday news conference that the city’s order covering more than 265,000 residents goes into effect Thursday and lasts through the end of April. Similar to other jurisdictions, the order includes exemptions for people going to get food or medicine or completing other essential tasks. Schewel said Durham County has 74 cases, including at least eight cases of community spread. The area ranks among the counties with the most cases in the state.  “What we know about this virus is that it spreads easily and fast,” he said. “Once cases begin multiplying, as they have in Italy and New York, the rise in the number of cases is exponential. And that is exactly what we are trying to avoid and to stop here in Durham.”  For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.  The tighter restrictions came as General Assembly members held their first formal meeting to determine what lawmakers can offer to buttress the state’s response. GOP House Speaker Tim Moore created four COVID-19 working groups, led by both Republicans and Democrats, that could recommend bills to the full legislature when it reconvenes.  The annual session is set to begin April 28, but there’s been talk that the governor would call lawmakers back sooner. Cooper has said his administration is compiling legislative action and spending requests. Moore and one House colleague were the only members to attend the economic work group meeting in person at the Legislative Building, with the rest participating by video conference.  The speaker said chamber leaders were looking at ways to reduce the spreading threat should they reconvene. Moore said one way would be to expand the time period to complete floor votes, currently 15 seconds for the House, to an hour, so that members can avoid close contact with each other. The state constitution requires a majority of legislators in a chamber be “actually present” to complete public business.  “This is an unprecedented time in our state, and it’s an unprecedented time here at the legislature,” Moore said, adding that his chamber is prepared to convene before late April if necessary.  GOP Senate leader Phil Berger and Minority Leader Dan Blue said Wednesday in a joint statement that fellow senators would collect ideas with a goal of coming to a consensus with Cooper and the House on “how to help all North Carolinians.”   ___  Follow Robertson at www.twitter.com/GaryDrobertson and Drew at www.twitter.com/JonathanLDrew   ___  Follow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.

Nursing homes have been the sites of some of the earliest — and deadliest — outbreaks of COVID-19. Some people who run such facilities are understandably leery of accepting new patients who might spread the virus.  Nonetheless, some of the largest states are now ordering nursing homes to accept patients who have been discharged from the hospital but are still recovering from COVID-19.  These state directives have been strongly condemned by the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine. Dr. Sabine von Preyss, chief medical officer for Avalon Health Care Group and president of the society's Washington state chapter, says that a distinction must be made between nursing homes that have suffered COVID-19 outbreaks and those that are still virus-free.  \"The question is, should we be forced to introduce a disease with such deadly potential into a population that has been sheltered?\" says von Preyss. \"And my experience tells me that would be ill-advised.\"  Also, it won't even help overcrowded hospitals, says Dr. Michael Wasserman, who heads the California Association of Long Term Care Medicine.  \"If you push folks out of the hospitals to make space and you push them into nursing homes a couple weeks later,\" Wasserman says, \"for every one of those you send to the nursing home, you may get 20 back in the hospital.\"  New York and New Jersey both have ordered nursing homes to admit patients regardless of their COVID-19 status. California had a similar directive. And then suddenly, as of March 30, it didn't. After a couple of days of outcry from the medical community, the state softened its instruction.  It now says that a nursing home \"can be expected\" to receive residents who test positive for the virus if it is able to follow the infection control guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Tony Chicotel, a staff attorney with California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, isn't satisfied with the change. That's because the state let stand the emergency waivers that allow nursing homes to temporarily expand capacity and reduce staff.  \"We're going to have, potentially, a lot more residents crammed into nursing homes,\" says Chicotel. \"You're going to cut the staffing minimums at the same time. And then you're going to introduce perhaps the most efficient killer of older adults into the building? You've got a recipe for disaster in nursing homes.\"  Despite requests from NPR, neither New York nor California officials made themselves available for interviews to discuss the policies.  Some other states are taking a different approach. Some are reviving closed nursing homes or empty wings to exclusively treat coronavirus-positive patients.  In Louisiana, which has clusters of COVID-19 patients in more than 60 nursing homes, a facility is prohibited from admitting people who have tested positive for the virus or who were treated for respiratory problems, unless it can show it has the capacity to care for them.  \"What we were looking at is really what makes the most sense for the patients themselves and the other residents,\" says Dr. Alex Billioux, the assistant secretary for Louisiana's Office of Public Health.  Louisiana has what he calls Tier 2 hospitals, as well as new care facilities, such as the one at the convention center in New Orleans. (Tier 2 facilities don't have emergency room capabilities and are more likely to be specialized facilities, such as psychiatric or rehabilitation hospitals.)  \"Individuals who were still too ill to return back to a nursing home could be sent to those Tier 2 facilities — where they're still getting nursing care and attention,\" says Billioux. \"And we know that the majority of these individuals will recover and then be able to be moved back to a nursing facility.\"  That's the ultimate goal, say public health officials, because those skilled nursing facilities aren't just where patients receive medical care. They're often also the place patients call home.  Copyright 2020 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.   NOEL KING, HOST:  Some of the earliest and most deadly outbreaks of COVID-19 Have been in nursing homes. But some states are ordering nursing homes to accept patients who've been hospitalized for COVID-19 because there are not hospital beds anywhere else. Here's NPR's Ina Jaffe.  INA JAFFE, BYLINE: The state directives ordering nursing homes to admit patients regardless of their COVID-19 status have been strongly condemned by the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine. Dr. Sabine von Preyss is the president of the Washington state chapter. She says that a distinction must be made between nursing homes that have suffered COVID-19 outbreaks and those that are still COVID-free.  SABINE VON PREYSS: The question is, should we be forced to introduce a disease with such deadly potential into a population that has been sheltered? And my experience tells me that would be ill-advised.  JAFFE: And it won't even help overcrowded hospitals, says Dr. Michael Wasserman, the head of the California Association of Long Term Care Medicine.  MICHAEL WASSERMAN: If you push folks out of the hospitals to make space and you push them into nursing homes, a couple weeks later, for every one of those you send to the nursing home, you may get 20 back.  JAFFE: New York and New Jersey have both ordered nursing homes to admit patients regardless of their COVID-19 status. California had a similar directive, and then suddenly it didn't. After a couple of days of outcry from the medical community, the state softened its instruction. It now says that a nursing home can expect to receive COVID-positive residents if it can follow CDC infection prevention guidelines. But advocates for nursing home residents aren't satisfied.  TONY CHICOTEL: You've got a recipe for disaster in nursing homes.  JAFFE: That's Tony Chicotel, a staff attorney with California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform. The problem, he says, isn't just whether California nursing homes will accept COVID-positive patients - the state has also waived regulations so that nursing homes can temporarily increase capacity and reduce staff.  CHICOTEL: We're going to have, potentially, a lot more residents crammed into nursing homes. You're going to cut the staffing minimums at the same time, and then you're going to introduce perhaps the most efficient killer of older adults into the building?

Akinsehinwa, who said this in a statement on Sunday, urged the nation’s leaders to take the lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic to prioritise local health care delivery by investing more in the sector.  He said, “Our people should please cooperate with the Federal Government as well as the state governments on all the efforts to curtail the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.  “I also advise that anybody who is sick with any of the symptoms of the virus to go to the hospital; after all coronavirus is not a death sentence if those who contracted it reported to the medical doctor early.  “I think the people in government should learn from this global pandemic to build good hospitals, good schools, and provide employment for our youths.  “This pandemic has taught us so many lessons in leadership. One is that before you do father Christmas, feed you immediate family first. By this I mean that before we help other nations, our people should come first; before you go on medical tourism abroad, build good hospitals for your people at home because you may need the hospital at a time like this.

The design of safety studies makes it difficult to spot problems.   Safety monitoring is inadequate.   Vaccine adjuvants increase risk.  “The FDA receives 45% of its annual budget from the pharmaceutical industry.  The World Health Organization (WHO) gets roughly half its budget from private sources, including Pharma and its allied foundations.  And the CDC, frankly, is a vaccine company; it owns 56 vaccine patents and buys and distributes $4.6 billion in vaccines annually through the Vaccines for Children program, which is over 40% of its total budget.” — Robert F. Kennedy, Jr  1) An admission that adjuvants can multiply the toxicity of vaccines:  “Adjuvants multiply the immunogenicity of the antigens that they are added to, and that is their intention. It seems to me they multiply the reactogenicity in many instances, and therefore it seems to me that it is not unexpected if they multiply the incidence of adverse reactions that are associated with the antigen, but may not have been detected through lack of statistical power in the original studies.” — Stephen Evans, BA, MSc, Professor of Pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM)  2) Warnings about long-term systemic toxicity from vaccine adjuvants:  “You are correct. As we add adjuvants, especially some of the more recent adjuvants, such as the ASO1, saponin-derived adjuvants, we do see increased local reactogenicity. The primary concern, though, usually is systemic adverse events rather than local adverse events. And we tend to get in Phase II and Phase III studies quite good data on the local reactogenicity. Those of us in this room that are beyond the age of 50 who have had the pleasure of having the recent shingles vaccine, will know that this does have quite significant local reactogenicity. If you got the vaccine, you know that you got the vaccine. But this is not the major health concern. The major health concern which we are seeing are accusations of long term, long term effects. So, to come back to this, I’m going to once again point to the regulators. It comes down to ensuring that we conduct Phase II and the Phase III studies with adequate size and with the appropriate measurement.” — Martin Howell Friede, PhD (Biochemistry) – WHO coordinator for the Initiative for Vaccine Research  3) An admission that the WHO and Big Pharma are panicking because of some doctors and cover-up of vaccine injuries:  “There’s a lot of safety science that’s needed, and without the good science, we can’t have good communication. Although I’m talking about all these other contextual issues and communication issues it absolutely needs science as the backbone. You can’t repurpose the same old science to make it sound better if you don’t have the science that’s relevant to the new problem. So, we need much more investment in safety science…The other thing that’s a trend and an issue is not just confidence in patients but the confidence of health care providers. We have a very wobbly health professional front line that is starting to question vaccines and the safety of vaccines. When the front-line professionals are starting to question (the safety of vaccines) or they don’t feel like they have enough confidence about the safety to stand up to it to the person asking them the questions. I mean, most medical school curriculums, even nursing curriculums, I mean in medical school you’re lucky if you have a half-day on vaccines. Never mind keeping up to date with all this.” — Heidi Larson, Ph.D. (in Anthropology – and therefore likely to be vaccinology-illiterate!) and Director of the Big Pharma-funded Vaccine Confidence Project  4) An admission that vaccine clinical safety trials are flawed and that vaccines damage children far more than they damage adults:  “One of the additional issues that complicate safety evaluation is that if you look at, and you struggle with the length of follow-up that should be adequate in a, let’s say a pre-licensure or even post-marketing study if that’s even possible. And again, as you mentioned pre-licensure clinical trials may not be powered enough. It’s also the subject population that you administer the adjuvant to because we’ve seen data presented to us where an adjuvant, a particular adjuvant added to a vaccine antigen did really nothing when administered to a certain population and usually the elderly, you know, compared to administering the same formulation to younger age strata. So, these are things which need to be considered as well and further complicate safety and effectiveness evaluation of adjuvants combined with vaccine antigens.” — Marion Gruber, Ph.D. – Director, FDA Office of Vaccines Research and Review (OVRR) and the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)  5) A warning about the lack of vaccine safety monitoring systems:  “I think we cannot over-emphasize the fact that we really don’t have very good safety monitoring systems in many countries, and this adds to the miscommunication and the misapprehensions because we’re not able to give clear-cut answers when people ask questions about the deaths that have occurred due to a particular vaccine, and this always gets blown up in the media. One should be able to give a very factual account of what exactly has happened and what the causes of the deaths are, but in most cases, there is some obfuscation at that level and therefore, there’s less and less trust then in the system.” —Soumya Swaminathan, MD, WHO Chief Scientist and non-practicing Pediatrician (involved in academics and research ever since her medical training)  6) An admission that viral fragments don’t work and that adjuvants are responsible for the toxic inflammatory responses to vaccines.  “Every time that there is an association, be it temporal or not temporal, the first accusation is it is the adjuvant. And yet, without adjuvants, we are not going to have the next generation of vaccines. And many of the vaccines that we do have, ranging from tetanus through to HPV require adjuvants in order for them to work. So, the challenge that we have in front of us is: How do we build confidence in this? And the confidence, first of all, comes from the regulatory agencies (I look to Marion). When we add an adjuvant it’s because it is essential. We do not add adjuvants to vaccines because we want to do so. But when we add them, it adds to the complexity. I give courses every year on “How do you develop vaccines?”, “How do you make vaccines?” And the first lesson is, while you’re making your vaccine, if you can avoid using an adjuvant, please do so. Lesson two is, if you’re going to use an adjuvant, use one that has a history of safety. And lesson three is, if you’re not going to do that, think very carefully.” — Martin Howell Friede, WHO Coordinator for the Initiative for Vaccine Research and member of the Strategic Advisory Committee for Hilleman Labs – a vaccine research company co-owned by US drugmaker Merck and Britain’s Wellcome Trust.  7) An admission that vaccine safety tracking systems don’t exist.  “Now the only way to tease that out is if you have a large population database like the vaccine safety datalink as well as some of the other national databases that are coming to being worthy. Actual vaccine exposure is trapped down to that level of specificity of who is the manufacturer? What is the lot number? Etc, etc. And there’s an initiative to try to make the vaccine label information bar-coded so that it includes that level of information. So that in the future when we do these type of studies, we are able to tease that out. And in order to be – each time you subdivide them, the sample size gets becoming more and more challenging and that’s what I said earlier today about that we’re really only in the beginning of the era of large data sets where hopefully you could start to kind of harmonize the databases for multiple studies. And there’s actually an initiative underway… Marion (Gruber) may want to comment on it to try to get more national vaccine safety database linked together so we could start to answer these types of questions that you just raised.” — Robert Chen, MD – Scientific Director, Brighton Collaboration The motto of the Brighton Collaboration was “We build trust in the safety of vaccines through rigorous science”  8) An admission that the WHO doesn’t understand the mechanisms of vaccine toxicity.  “So in our clinical trials, we are actually using relatively small sample sizes, and when we do that we’re at risk of tyranny of small numbers, which is, you just need a single case of Wegener’s Granulomatosis, and your vaccine has to, solve Walt’s, How do you prove a Null Hypothesis? …And it takes years and years to try to figure that out. It’s a real conundrum, right? Getting the right size, dealing with the tyranny of small numbers, making sure that you can really do it. And so I think one of the things that we really need to invest in are kind of better biomarkers, better mechanistic understanding of how these things work so we can better understand adverse events as they come up.” — David Kaslow, MD, VP of Essential Medicines, Drug Development program PATH Center for Vaccine Innovation and Access (CVIA) Dr. Kaslow has been a non-clinical researcher for decades with past relationships with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Merck.  9) A naïve question directed to WHO experts (and not answered by them) that points out the reality that Big Vaccine corporations have NEVER done studies on the synergistic damage vaccine toxicities that happen when more than two vaccines are injected at the same office visit.  “I cast back my mind to our situation in Nigeria where at six weeks, ten weeks, fourteen weeks, a child is being given different antigens from different companies, and these vaccines have different adjuvants and different preservatives and so on. Something crosses my mind… is there a possibility of these adjuvants, preservatives, cross-reacting amongst themselves? Have there ever been a study on the possibility of cross-reactions on from the past that you can share the experience with us?” — Bassey Okposen – Program Manager, National Emergency Routine Immunization Coordination Centre (NERICC).

His column often deals with various unappreciated health issues, including those caused by Big Pharma’s over-drugging, Big Vaccine’s over-vaccinating, Big Medicine’s over-screening, over-diagnosing and over-treating agendas and Big Food’s malnourishing food industry. Those four sociopathic entities can combine to even more adversely affect the physical, mental, spiritual and economic health of the recipients of the vaccines, drugs, medical treatments and the eaters of the tasty and ubiquitous “Franken Foods” – particularly when they are consumed in combinations, doses and potencies that have never been tested for safety or long-term effectiveness.

The CDC sent test kits earlier in the outbreak to public health labs around the country, but those kits were problematic and potentially inaccurate, CDC officials have since said.  McCarthy, a staff physician at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, says he still does not have access to test kits.  “I’m here to tell you, right now, at one of the busiest hospitals in the country, I don’t have it at my finger tips,” he said. “I still have to make my case, plead to test people. This is not good. We know that there are 88 cases in the United States. There are going to be hundreds by middle of week. There’s going to be thousands by next week. And this is a testing issue.”  In contrast to McCarthy’s “in the field” analysis, TV Doctor Drew Pinsky claims it’s “overblown press created hysteria.”  As Summit News’ Steve Watson notes, David Drew Pinsky, otherwise known as ‘Dr Drew’, has slammed the media for over-hyping the coronavirus, leading people the world over to panic buy provisions and medical supplies.  Speaking with Daily Blast Live, Dr. Drew said  “Let me frame it this way: we have in the United States 24 million cases of flu-like illness, 180,000 hospitalizations, 16,000 dead from influenza,” “Why is that not being reported? Why isn’t the message: get your flu shot?” he added.

The new cases announced brings the total cases in the county to 14.  Jeffrey Duchin, a health officer for Seattle and King County, said during a press conference that the county had confirmed 4 new cases on Monday, bringing its total to 14. Of these 4 new cases, two had died, while 1 previously reported the patient had also passed away.  The Seattle Times reported that the F5 Office Tower in downtown Seattle had closed for cleaning after an employee had contact with a coronavirus patient.  In other recent news, Oman has become the latest Middle Eastern state to ban travelers from coronavirus-impacted countries, joining Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.  Senegal has become the second country in sub-Saharan Africa to confirm a coronavirus case, joining a growing list of countries and cities that have reported their first cases on Monday. In Northern Africa, Algeria reported two new cases, bringing its total to 5.

The WHO Director-General made the remark in response to a question about the culpability of certain governments for the global spread of the coronavirus.   Mr.WorthLess  The outbreak only kills roughly 2% of those it infects, Dr. Tedros said. Because of this, he said, Dr. Tedros believes that “the stigma, to be honest, is more dangerous than the virus itself,” he said. “Let’s really underline that. The stigma is the most dangerous enemy, for me, it’s more than the virus itself.”  Translation: The WHO is prioritizing defending Beijing’s actions – i.e. ‘battling racism’ – over its responsibility to combat the virus.  “Concerns and worries are understandable. It’s fine to be concerned and worried, but let’s calm down and do the right thing,” he added later before ending the briefing.  WHO’S TEDROS SAYS HUMANITY NOW HAS A COMMON ENEMY  WHO’S TEDROS SAYS STIGMA IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN VIRUS ITSELF  Dr. Tedros then launched into a defense of the WHO’s decision to delay the decision to declare the virus a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), before pointing out the fact that in 55 countries have confirmed less than 100 cases.  “Even if it’s more, it can be contained.”  So, Dr. Tedros started the press conference explaining why it’s not appropriate to describe the outbreak as a pandemic, before declaring it a “common enemy” of the human race.  We seem to have lost the thread.  The truth is that all of the warnings of alleged ‘conspiracy theorists’ have turned out to be correct The word translated “pestilence” is often translated as “plague” or “disaster” …  The godly are jealous of those believers in Christ, who are living in wickedness, idolatry, and immorality. They are jealous for them with a godly jealousy, and with a desire to see them walk in holiness and to worship Jesus Christ as their ONLY Lord. The ungodly tolerant (appease, accept, allow for, and indulge) evil. The godly oppose, disallow and expose evil for what it is. The ungodly test the godly with lies, deceptions, manipulations, tricks, schemes, the twisting of truth, and with their false testimonies (slander) in order to try to trip them up, or to get them to give up and back down….  None of which is to suggest that we do not suffer from a “long train of abuses and usurpations” that do amount to a grave constitutional crisis. We do. But much of the crisis stems from our failure to acknowledge it as such.  By “constitutional crisis” is meant that the Constitution itself — and, by extension, the constitutional order that has served America well for 230 years — is under threat of destruction. This is assuredly not the case when a president is impeached or a scandal-ridden Congress sees some of its own investigated, indicted, or even forced to resign. Such sensational events are unfortunately used as distractions to divert popular attention from the very real damage being inflicted on the Constitution by elected and unelected government officials who refuse to acknowledge limits on their power.  A case in point is the abandonment of Congress’ constitutional authority to declare war, last exercised in 1941 when the U.S. Congress declared war on Japan, Germany, and their allies upon entry into World War II after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. With the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, President Truman cited the UN Security Council as his authority to commit U.S. forces to the war on the Korean peninsula. The UN treaty, Truman averred, was superior in authority to the U.S. Congress, and therefore the congressional authority of declaring war was no longer necessary. In 1973, Congress formalized its abdication of war-making authority by passing the War Powers Act, which grants the president essentially unlimited power to start and wage war, provided he report to Congress within 48 hours after initiating hostilities.  Elites Known These Days as “the Ungodly”  In the Bible, the word translated “perversion” is used to define a deviation from righteousness in sexual behavior (Leviticus 18:23; Romans 1:27; Ephesians 4:19; Colossians 3:5), speech (Proverbs 10:31), or justice (Ecclesiastes 5:8). In each case, there are warnings against using for evil something that God created as good.  Satan twists things. Every good thing that God created, Satan works to pervert. God created sexuality and called it good (Genesis 1:27-28, 31). Sexual union has a dual purpose—procreation (Genesis 1:28; 9:1) and joining marriage partners as “one flesh” (Genesis 2:24; Mark 10:8; 1 Corinthians 6:16).  Evil is usually thought of as that which is morally wrong, sinful, or wicked; however, the word evil can also refer to anything that causes harm, with or without the moral dimension. The word is used both ways in the Bible. Anything that contradicts the holy nature of God is evil (see Psalm 51:4). On the flip side, any disaster, tragedy, or calamity can also be called an “evil” (see 1 Kings 17:20, KJV).  Evil behavior includes sin committed against other people (murder, theft, adultery) and evil committed against God (unbelief, idolatry, blasphemy). From the disobedience in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 2:9) to the wickedness of Babylon the Great (Revelation 18:2), the Bible speaks of the fact of evil, and man is held responsible for the evil he commits: “The one who sins is the one who will die” (Ezekiel 18:20).  Essentially, evil is a lack of goodness. Moral evil is not a physical thing; it is a lack or privation of a good thing. As Christian philosopher J. P. Moreland has noted, “Evil is a lack of goodness. It is goodness spoiled. You can have good without evil, but you cannot have evil without good.” Or as Christian apologist Greg Koukl has said, “Human freedom was used in such a way as to diminish goodness in the world, and that diminution, that lack of goodness, that is what we call evil.”  1. Evil hearts are experts at creating confusion and contention.  They twist the facts, mislead, lie, avoid taking responsibility, deny reality, make up stories, and withhold information. (Psalms 5:8; 10:7; 58:3; 109:2–5; 140:2; Proverbs 6:13,14; 6:18,19; 12:13; 16:20; 16:27, 28; 30:14; Job 15:35; Jeremiah 18:18; Nehemiah 6:8; Micah 2:1; Matthew 12:34,35; Acts 6:11–13; 2 Peter 3:16)  The silencing of the American people before 2020?  “The human heart is an idol factory.”  The Un-Godly — Those That Suppress the Truth, the social media giants built multi-billion dollar empires by giving everyone a voice, but now that they have such a dominant position on the Internet they have decided that many prominent conservative voices should be completely silenced.  The Left, a broad term for Liberal Socialist Democrats that can only be explained fully by using the Bible explanation of the human race is as follows. A servant of Satan, because you are either saved or lost. This election has brought out the true nature of who you serve. Simply put, it’s Donald Trump, Conservatives, and Christians against the rest of the world. The Left’s Love applies only to those who believe as they do. They Love evil and commit Anarchy against those who love good. They are governed by lies and never tell the truth. On this Friday, Inaugural Day for the swearing-in of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States the Left wants to commit widespread Anarchy to shut down the swearing-in ceremony. Their goal of transforming America, which was founded in Judea Christian values into a Pagan Nation is almost complete. Their goal has always been the total removal of God from American society and the downfall of America. Donald Trump says he is a Presbyterian, but he left off the USA, an apostate church.  Everything done in dark will be brought to light, being biblically bankrupt will not exclude the elitist.  Watchmen, of today, are called to speak the word of the Lord from within the court, mounting an internal critique. The pressures on Nathan to keep silent after David seized Bathsheba and sent her husband to his death must have been enormous. He could have vented himself in a scathing editorial and then kept his head down. From all appearances, though, Nathan had free access to the court, was a friend of David, and a close adviser. It is said that prophets spoke truth to power, but that goes beyond cliché when we realize that prophets spoke the truth face to face with power, to powerful men and women whom the prophets knew intimately, frequently from their own position of power.  People’s hearts are troubled, their minds are in a state of confusion, the Bible tells us a time of great delusion that will come upon the people, that time has arrived, the politicians must come up with more significant and more believable lies in order to bring on the antichrist, we have entered the doorstep Tribulation.  This Is Where We Are Today, Pay Close Attention Going Forward, There Are Those High-Tech/Corporations That Want to Mislead You in the Path of Darkness  In this very important story over at Activist Post titled “YouTube Just Purged 17,000 Channels For Hate Speech, Some Broke NO RULES AT ALL“, Steve Quayle left an absolutely crucial note while linking to the story: “You are watching the assassination of free speech in America in real-time!”  “All political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable.” Just look at some of our modern-day examples: torture is “enhanced interrogation techniques”; murder is “collateral damage”; the aggression initiation of war is a “pre-emptive strike”; the theft of taxpayers’ money is a “bailout”, and the theft of depositors’ money in a bank is a “haircut” or “bail-in”.In a blatant example of Newspeak, the New World Order controllers (through the psychiatric DSM V) have tried to rename pedophiles as “minor-attracted persons” and redefine pedophilia as “sexual orientation”. This makes no sense since sexual orientation has to do with gender, not age, with whether you are attracted to males or females, not how old they are. There are even organizations (like B4UAct.org) which are claiming that pedophiles are being unfairly stigmatized for their feelings! Psychiatry, it should also be noted, has a history of inventing fictitious diseases such as ADHD (as admitted by its inventor on his deathbed by Leon Eisenberg).  Wow, Don’t You Feel Better, the Roprobate’s at the CDC, and Who Has Spoken to the Little People, Pres. Trump, Rush Limbaugh and Politicians Agree. It’s Just the Flu Bro…  As humanity struggles to “adapt” to the coronavirus outbreak, which has suddenly introduced a patina of sinister risk to mundane activities like greeting a friend or visiting the supermarket, the Yon Loo Lin School of Medicine has published a ‘new greetings’ guide to help people in virus-stricken communities learn new greetings like the “elbow tap”, “foot shake” and, of course, the “wave.” WHO and the CDC, are clueless as always.  Liberty is better, not perfect. And governments, including the WHO and the CDC, are clueless as always.  Dr. Sylvie Briand, the WHO’s director of epidemic and pandemic, tweeted a screenshot of what appears to be a new WHO guide to these ‘alternatives’ to the cheek-kiss and the handshake, popular greetings throughout the world.  Force is now the only rule remaining in deep state-controlled America. Everything has collapsed, no free speech, no fair trial, no system of justice, no reasonable expectation of human rights anywhere, no fair elections, no trustworthy news, no legitimate Wall Street operations, no real public education, no clean food, and threats from the elitist.  Coronavirus Criminals: The CDC Deliberately Released Infected Patient in San Antonio While Positioning Itself to Financially Benefit From an Exploding Epidemic  The CDC just deliberately released an infected coronavirus patient in San Antonio, Texas. The number of “accidental” releases of infected patients, the nearly four-week withholding of diagnostic test kits and the downplaying of the severity of the outbreak can no longer be explained away as coincidence. This appears to be a deliberate, planned strategy to spread the coronavirus across America, cause nationwide chaos and get more funding and medical martial law powers for the CDC itself.  “The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a patient from isolation in San Antonio, Texas, after two tests returned negative for the new coronavirus, but the person later tested positive,” reports The Epoch Times.  So the CDC messed up yet again, failing to make sure the person was truly cleared of coronavirus before releasing him into the general public. The CDC later attempted to cover this catastrophic error by saying, “Following the patient’s release, results of a subsequent sample were received, and determined to be weakly positive. Out of an abundance of caution, CDC decided to bring the individual back into isolation at a local medical facility.”  The CDC is now using transgender-like language to describe virus test results  For starters, from a virology point of view, there’s no such thing as “weakly positive.” Testing for the coronavirus produces a binary result. It’s either positive or negative. Is the CDC seriously going to start telling us people are now “sort of positive” or “kinda negative” or other such nonsense? Suddenly the CDC sounds like a transgender high school student explaining how he/she fluidly transitions between 47 different genders by merely wishing for socially acceptable virtue signaling transitions.  This latest mistake is on top of the CDC deliberately withholding coronavirus testing kits from the entire country for nearly four weeks, allowing the virus to exponentially multiply with near-zero surveillance about which communities are already infected.  According to truly bombshell new research that studied the mutation rate of the coronavirus in the wild, the coronavirus has been spreading for six weeks in Washington State, infecting as many as 1,500 people in that state alone.  It was only the independent media — like NaturalNews.com — that sounded the alarm on the near-total lack of coronavirus testing across the country, pointing out that it’s impossible to detect infections if you don’t test for them. I even coined the term, “Don’t Test, Don’t Tell,” which has since been echoed by many others. (Source: My article from Feb. 25)  Former FDA director Gottlieb warns “thousands” are already infected in America  We’ve now reached the point where, according to former FDA director Scott Gottlieb, there are “thousands” of infections in America right now. Before Gottlieb said that, I publicly estimated anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 coronavirus infections in the United States right now. Gottlieb says it’s “low thousands.” Via ZeroHedge:  Former FDA Director Scott Gottlieb, who has been far more vocal than the current FDA director thanks to his regular appearances on CNBC and other cable news channels, warned during an interview on CNBC Monday morning that the public shouldn’t trust the administration’s rhetoric.  The fact is, things are far from ‘okay’, Gottlieb said. Now that the government is expanding testing, the US case count will ‘grow rapidly’. The public should start stocking up on supplies and preparing for widespread disruptions. Gottlieb warned that the number of cases in the US has probably already reached the ‘low thousands’. Hundreds could be confirmed by the end of the week.  Note the stark contrast between Gottlieb and current FDA / CDC officials who are universally lying to the American public and even telling people it’s bad to buy food, hand sanitizers or medical masks.  The Trump administration is floundering over this issue and U.S. government propaganda currently appears almost indistinguishable from communist China’s own propaganda parade. (Will the U.S. soon start hiding coronavirus deaths? Probably…)  The CDC stands to receive billions in new funding as the coronavirus explodes across America  Every U.S. government agency prioritizes its own survival and expansion over everything else. Throughout U.S. history, events have been staged to rapidly increase federal funding as part of a problem-reaction-solution cycle that’s often rooted in deliberately staged “emergencies.”  For example, the ATF received a huge influx of new funding after staging the David Koresh / Waco, Texas raid in the 1990s. The entire thing was rigged, staged for CNN’s camera and carefully controlled to create an emergency where none existed. Koresh could have easily been arrested on the street while out shopping for groceries, but instead, the ATF staged a murderous raid that deliberately killed dozens of women and children.  Similarly, the Oklahoma City federal building bombing was quite literally plotted by the FBI to increase funding for the FBI. They recruited the scapegoat, provided the explosives, evacuated their own offices and even planted explosives in the federal building there, all to create blood and gore for the cable news cameras so that more funding could be approved to combat “extremists” in America, all under Bill Clinton of course. To this day, the FBI is the single most prolific source of terror plots across America, and that fact is openly confirmed by the New York Times, the Kansas City Star and other mainstream media outlets.  Similarly, the Disneyland measles outbreak from a couple of years ago was staged to push for mandatory vaccines in California (SB 277, Richard Pan), and now the CDC is actively allowing coronavirus to escape confinement as part of a malicious plot to cause infections to spread across America. The primary beneficiary of the outbreak? The CDC itself, which could receive billions in new funding. (Apparently, a $6.5 billion annual budget isn’t enough.)  What’s even more insane is the fact that this covid-19 coronavirus is the product of biological weapons development programs that were funded by the NIH itself to the tune of nearly $700 million.  So the taxpayers funded this weapon system, and now that it has been unleashed upon the world, the very same “death science” government bureaucrats who caused the problem will demand billions in new funding to solve it.

I wanted “The Great Disruptor.” I wanted the swamp drained. But, above all, I wanted America to truly become great again. It didn’t happen, none of it. Instead, we’re in a far worse far more dangerous spot than we were just two years ago.  Taking Away Guns Is Essential for Tyranny.

Source: HNewsWire NewsTarget ZeroHedge   StevieRay Hansen   Editor, HNewsWire.com  This day is here– get ready, the virus WILL spreads throughout the US and Europe, governments will respond the same way China’s government has; martial law and full-blown concentration camp culture. This would lead to civil war in the US because we are armed and many people will shoot anyone trying to put us into quarantine camps. Europe is mostly screwed. The establishment then suggests that paper money be removed from the system because it is a viral spreader. China is already pushing this solution now. Magically, we find ourselves in a cashless society in a matter of a year or two; which is what the globalists have been demanding for years. Everything goes digital, and thus even local economies become completely centralized as private trade dies. “AntiChrist Is On His Temporary Thorne”   StevieRay Hansen  The truth is that all of the warnings of alleged ‘conspiracy theorists’ have turned out to be correct The word translated “pestilence” is often translated as “plague” or “disaster” …  The Bible predicts the rise of this type of societal control within the frightening prophecies about the Antichrist, the final world empire called the Beast, and the final economic system using the Mark of the Beast. The electronic tyranny of technocracy that is now being developed and implemented throughout the world is in preparation for the Antichrist’s rise to power. As we see this final empire taking shape in our day, we can know for certain that the End Times is upon us and the Coming of Christ is drawing near.

In order for sin to work, there has to be a “suppression of the truth.”  The World leaders Are Having Trouble With The Truth, and The World Has been “Quarantined” Tribulation Is Here…  Thousands of People Are Basically Trapped in a Petri Dish of Disease   Demon Virus  Asked about the virus while traveling abroad last week, Trump said: “We have it totally under control”. In a separate Twitter posting, he offered reassurance but scant detail for his confidence. By Associated Press Updated On: 05:53 PST, Jan 31, 2020  Yes, are we seeing a slowdown in new virus cases reported this morning. We now have 31,481, which does show a day-to-day decline away from an exponential rate of growth if accurate. Yet for those market participants merrily saying this is “just the flu” (there are some) we also have 4,824, 15% of the total, in critical condition and 638 deaths. Further, one arguably cannot measure the death-rate of any virus against the number of currently sick people: you surely measure it against those who eventually recover vs. those who don’t. Given we have 1,563 who have recovered vs. 638 dead (and 4,824 critical) that is a worrying ratio of 29% dead as an end-outcome, which is right up there with the MERS virus from a few years ago – although, yes, there is real reason for us all to hope that number will decline sharply as milder cases will be fully curable. But the simple flu this is not.  WASHINGTON: Wuhan coronavirus: Donald Trump says deadly outbreak ‘very well under control’ as WHO declares a global emergency. President Donald Trump regaled a friendly New Jersey campaign crowd with his thoughts about impeachment, the economy, the border wall, local politics and much more.  But he was conspicuously quiet on January 28 about one big issue keeping much of the globe on pins and needles: the spread of a deadly new type of coronavirus. It has killed more than 170 people in China, sickened thousands more there and led to a handful of confirmed cases in the US, including the first US case of person-to-person transmission reported on by health officials. The State Department on January 30 advised all US citizens against traveling to China.  Trump, a self-described germaphobe, generally has discussed the virus in broad terms, but he offered some of his most extensive comments on the issue to date during an appearance on January 30 at a Michigan manufacturing plant. “Hopefully, it won’t be as bad as some people think it could be, but we’re working very closely with them (Chinese) and with a lot of other people and a lot of other countries, he said. “We think we have it very well under control.”  The Birth Pains Are Growing Stronger….  One of the signs of ruling class collapse is when they can no longer enforce the rules that maintain them as a ruling class. When the Romans started making exceptions to republican governance, it was a matter of time before someone simply decided the rules no longer applied to them. Perhaps the robot historians will consider Obama our Marius or Sulla. Maybe that person is in the near future. Either way, the rule of law is over and what comes next is the rule of men.  “Man will ultimately be governed by God or by tyrants.” as in Nancy Pelosi (D-San Fran-feces)  Our government has been overthrown. As evidenced by Trump’s capitulation on the border, his recent servitude to the GMO industry and his acquiescence to the warmongers, our President has been compromised. Our liberties are being eliminated one by one. Gun confiscation is next. The Constitution is gasping its last breaths. Our borders are destroyed and our culture has been turned upside down by every perversion known to man.  The watchman does not confuse truth with consensus.

Some patients may have lungs showing some areas of cloudiness, though most of it is black - indicating that they are filled with air.  Dr Kyle-Sidell, of the Maimonides Medical Center, explained that it was because patients were slowly being starved of oxygen.

The medic has been vocal in social media where he has called for ventilation techniques to be used in a slightly different way.  He says that Covid-19 doesn't act in the same way as another type of respiratory illness known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).  Therefore, he believes that means that treatment should be different too.  1 These X-rays, of a 44-year-old man who died from coronavirus, show damage to his lungs Credit: RSNA  Dr Kyle-Sidell tweeted: \"Everyone in the medical field... Patients need oxygen not pressure. Covid-19 is not ARDS.  \"Protocols MUST change. The time is NOW! Save 100,000 lives!\"  Dr Luciano Gattinoni, one of the world’s experts in mechanical ventilation, said that while the devices help patients breathe better they could cause lung damage due to the high pressure.  He urged doctors to take extra care when diagnosing patients, adding that ventilators should only be used when needed and as sparingly as possible.  As far as the variation in lung X-rays goes, Dr Gattinoni said he thinks that the problem may lie in the intricate vessels of the blood vessels of the lungs.  He said that when lungs become damaged, the vessels that carry blood through the vital organ shut down.

Here are five events that ran the risk.  Football – Atalanta vs Valencia, Italy, February 19  The city of Bergamo has been one of the cities hit hardest by the devastation wreaked in northern Italy, making the memory of the match that attracted 40,000 people to Atalanta's Champions League home in Milan a chilling one.  The hosts’ goals may have exacerbated the problem on what should have gone down as a momentous night courtesy of their 4-1 win over Valencia, with whom around 2,500 fans travelled to the San Siro from virus-hit Spain.  “I’m sure that 40,000 people hugging and kissing each other while standing a centimetre apart four times – because Atalanta scored four goals – was definitely an accelerator for contagion,” said Luca Lorini, the head of intensive care at the Pope John XXIII hospital in Bergamo.  “When peacetime comes, I can assure you we will go and see how many of the 40,000 people who went to the game became infected. Right now we have other priorities.\"  The contagion was reported in Valencia almost simultaneously, and a journalist from Spain who attended the round of 16 first leg duly became the second person to be infected in the region, which is now in one of the world’s strictest lockdowns.  Both squads also suffered as a consequence of what has been dubbed “Game Zero” by local media, with more than a third of Valencia’s squad becoming infected and goalkeeper Marco Sportiello providing Atalanta’s first positive case.  Also on rt.com 'I could hardly breathe': Paulo Dybala details coronavirus struggle after Juve ace and girlfriend Oriana Sabatini infected  One of Lorini’s colleagues, chief pneumologist Fabiano di Marco, told Corriere della Sera that the game had been “a biological bomb.”  Rugby Union – England vs Wales, England, March 7  England’s Six Nations trip to Italy the following Saturday had already been called off when more than 81,000 people descended on Twickenham, finding the home of the nation’s rugby union team dotted with hand sanitizer dispensers as fears over the impending outbreak increased.  Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister who subsequently enforced the lockdown before testing positive for the virus, was in attendance with his pregnant fiancee, and prop Mako Vunipola was left out of the England squad because of his recent trip through Hong Kong, although his appearance for club side Saracens on the same day underlined the confusion surrounding health measures.  Also on rt.com No idea when coronavirus-positive Boris Johnson will come out of isolation, UK health minister says  Lions coach Eddie Jones, who has now taken a pay cut of more than 25% as the Rugby Football Union reels from a projected loss that could exceed $60 million over the next 18 months, is currently stranded in Japan as a result of the pandemic.  His employers suspended all rugby within a fortnight of the narrow victory over Wales, bringing the county championship to a premature end for the first time outside of wartime since its inception in 1889.  Horse racing – Cheltenham Festival, England, March 10-13  Even the most casual followers of news and sport bulletins questioned whether the photos of crowds cramming to watch the key event on the UK horse racing calendar looked wise.  At least 60,000 fans thronged the grandstands on each of the four days of the festival in the small Gloucestershire town, peaking at almost 70,000 for headline race the Cheltenham Gold Cup on Friday the 13th.  Almost 20,000 enthusiasts are thought to have visited from Ireland, although no deaths have yet been directly linked to the event with the highest attendance of the immediate run-up to the national lockdown, which was implemented four days after the festival finished.  New reports have suggested that former royal family member Andrew Parker Bowles and ex-Premier League footballer Charlie Austin are among those to have reported symptoms of Covid-19 since attending Cheltenham.

Football – Liverpool vs Atletico Madrid, England, March 11  Jurgen Klopp was visibly furious with fans who held their hands out in the hope of a high five with him before the Champions League round of 16 second leg which packed more than 52,000 people into Anfield, including thousands from Madrid.  Also on rt.com Jurgen Klopp has shut down idiotic coronavirus questions – and he’s right, it’s really not important what famous people say  The severity of the situation was such that the wisdom of letting the match proceed was raised in the UK Parliament, meeting no suggestion from government figures that one of the final games played in England before sport was suspended should not have taken place.  Atletico’s own home matches were taking place behind closed doors as the impact of the virus became more evident in Spain than England at the time, although the 21 deaths in Liverpool from Covid-19 reported yesterday – only one had previously been recorded – suggest the game may have been a contributing factor.  “Some of these deaths certainly fit the timeline from the match,” public health expert Professor John Ashton told the Liverpool Echo.

The governing body is now rumoured to be contemplating a condensed, single-site conclusion to the season.

We know that for many of our people it will not be safe to be out in public in September. This will be true for some of the people who most savor the High Holy Days in shul. We could decide that a time of year that is the most palpable experience of oneness, we will be in full solidarity.  We know that wearing masks, minding distance from people whose voices they are supposed to be joining, and paying attention to hygiene around prayerbooks and yarmulkes and door handles would all be distracting from the intensity that the holy days require. We have reason to believe that singing itself, in fact, is one of the more potent pathways for transmitting coronavirus across distance and into an enclosed space.  We know that if the capacity of our spaces has to be reduced to one-sixth, or one-sixtieth, we would not have the experience of large community, and our clergy won’t be able to lead six services each day with presence and kavanah.  We are learning how people recently did Seders, which are enormous and textured Jewish productions. Even if they had never prepared or led them before they found ways to do something alone, or connect with others, or stream a virtual guide in real time. They drew on our help and coordination, but did it without our presence.  We know that pikuach nefesh (saving lives) and practicing V’ahavta l’re-acha kamocha (love your neighbor as yourself) are foundational to Judaism, and we have been learning how to label everything we do, don’t do, and do differently with those names.  So, what if we decided right now that we will reengineer the High Holy Days of 5781, using every tool at our disposal that is not a large in-person gathering?  We would bring to the surface that the point of the holy days is teshuvah — individual and collective reorienting and renewal and repair — and that’s not done anyway in a few days in sanctuaries. This wouldn’t be a matter of just simulating our services in a different modality. We could make teshuvah the center in ways we usually don’t. Instead of the workshops and the study groups and the discussions being add-ons, they would become the core.  At a time of year when the most powerful prayers ask, “Who will live and who will die?” we would be demonstrating that we take responsibility for life and death, in our synagogues and the wider community.  We would challenge ourselves to make community large and inclusive and tangible, but in different ways than before.  We would spare ourselves the thought of having temperature checks and turning people away, or fighting with people who refuse to wear masks. Or can you imagine having to decide who, especially among our most dedicated participants, has the privilege of attending the large service? What kind of hurt, what kind of statement about community, would people be taking away from that?  We would be acknowledging that every decision around how COVID-19 affects our synagogues has been time-consuming and exhausting, for our professionals and lay leaders. We could marshal that energy toward not a single annual happening but a two-month season, in ways that would not end but would actually generate the new year in our institutions.  And how would we do this?  Instead of a few days, the whole period of Elul and Tishrei would become our canvas.  We would present people with roadmaps for the teshuvah process — readings and prompts and practices for themselves and the people in their immediate lives.  We would set a goal of connecting with every single member and prospective member through a personal conversation.  We might set up shofar tours, the way school teachers are now going around neighborhoods today, so that the sound is heard by every last person at their home. We might organize group gatherings by rivers and streams for Tashlich ceremonies.  We would bring people together in small groups, in person if possible or on Zoom if necessary – for mussar reflection and work, for Torah learning, to listen and talk to a caring professional about a theme or practice related to change or renewal.  We would relaunch our Chesed (caring) Committees to refocus on our connection to the most vulnerable — the people who would still be confined because of medical condition or age, the people who have lost income, the people suffering from ongoing stresses or the aftereffects of this spring and summer.  We could have online traditional services and alternative services on the days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. We could create pre-recorded guides that people would bring in their homes or outside to the woods to lead them through a service, with the best of our music and teaching. We could have smaller prayer gatherings on the model of Selichot, through the month of Elul, throughout the days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, in and around Sukkahs during Tishrei.  We could as leaders spend the month of Elul talking to our congregants and asking what they are thinking these days about friendship, connection, community and quiet.  Some people might choose to gather in safe groups wearing masks — to make that a shared experience and grapple with that, meditate on what it has done to us. Others might choose individual experiences or online ones. Given a whole month, many might do some of each.  We wouldn’t do all this alone, congregation by congregation. It’s not possible. We could get to work now developing collaborations: the communities in a city or region, or groups around the country or the world with similar philosophies. These collaboratives could partner with Jewish musicians and teachers and online providers based anywhere. We could build together Elul platforms of daily and even hourly online events and resources.  We could finally all do the work we have been avoiding, of getting to the core of what our communities are about and for — or could be.   Do we dare?  Of course there are also good reasons not to give up our gatherings if we are allowed to have them. We might be able to do teshuvah work on our own — but there is power in the large communal gathering, and there is music that moves us that can’t be entirely replicated for everyone on an individual basis or even in small groups.  We didn’t say after Tree of Life that we would refuse to gather until we could reduce all risk to zero, or until everyone felt safe.  And let’s be honest — the High Holy Days are part of the business model for most of us — whether through ticket fees for guests or the value our members perceive in the annual services.  But the thought experiment would challenge us to question even some of these assumptions. Are our large services actually community-building for people beyond the regulars — and what do we have to do to make them more so? Could we provide two months of “value” so compelling that the financial situation of the synagogue would in fact be transformed for the better?  Even if we can and do have large High Holy Day services this fall, there are other things we can and ought to do. They will make whatever Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur we do have better, and at the same time equip us to be better synagogues year-round.  So join me in the thought experiment, even if where you land is to have big services if that’s possible:  What if we decided right now that we will not have large gatherings for the High Holy Days this fall?

The World Health Organization raised the threat level on Friday, the U.S. government cancelled a summit meeting scheduled in Las Vegas, an increasing number of companies are instituting travel bans and restrictions, border health checks are becoming more restrictive and there is growing concern about large conferences with people coming from different parts of the world,” IHS Markit said in a statement.  The firm said it had spent the past few weeks focused on safety measures, including setting up medical partnership with one of Houston’s leading hospitals and consulting with experts on infectious disease. But the firm decided the conference — one of the most important annual gatherings for the U.S. energy industry — could not go forward.  “Our number one concern is the health and safety of delegates and speakers, our partners, our colleagues and vendors,” IHS Markit said.

(Big League Politics) – Following the implosion of the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), his far-left supporters are getting desperate, and that includes New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio.  De Blasio is one of the most prominent public officials to endorse Sanders, and he wants other lefties to stick their necks out and lend their support for the hardcore socialist during his time of desperation.  “I deeply respect [Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts]. Our nation + our party are better + more progressive because of her leadership. Now our progressive movement needs her more than ever. Senator, if the shoe was on the other foot [Sanders] would have endorsed you already. Please join us!” he wrote in a pleading tweet on Tuesday morning.  De Blasio also hammered former Vice President Joe Biden in an MSNBC interview on “Morning Joe” on Tuesday morning, claiming that Biden “hasn’t been vetted.”  “Joe Biden hasn’t been vetted. He was in a perfect position: Early front-runner and then everyone thought he wasn’t gonna make it, turned their attention to [Mike Bloomberg], Bernie [Sanders], even to [Elizabeth] Warren for a while,” the mayor said while speaking with former Congressman Joe Scarborough.  “Joe Biden has a lot of issues he needs to speak to. If we don’t deal with it now, in the family, and have that blunt discussion, Donald Trump will,” he added, mentioning Biden’s positions on supporting the Iraq War, cutting social security and supporting Draconian criminal justice policies as being particularly problematic.  De Blasio’s recommendations have not been particularly well-received and have caused him to earn the scorn of his party’s establishment.  “Respectfully, I think a lot of people would think dealing with the coronavirus is a full time job for the Mayor of New York. Maybe stop telling a woman what to do and focus on that,” former Hillary Clinton aide Neera Tanden wrote in a tweet responding to De Blasio.  “Sir, we’re gonna need you to stop tweeting about your crush on Bernie and start addressing COVID-19 in the city for which you are *mayor,*” tweeted Eleanor’s Legacy, an identity politics group that promotes female candidates in New York.  “It assumes that she somehow owes him something here, and that Bernie doesn’t also owe her something, that Bernie doesn’t have responsibility in this equation — responsibility for his win or loss,” Democratic consultant Alexs Grenell said.  “That to me is what’s sexist — Elizabeth Warren is somehow responsible, by failing to provide an endorsement, for how Bernie performs as opposed to Bernie himself,” she added.  Bernie Bros such as NYC Mayor De Blasio only dig their hole deeper as they try to save Sanders’ fledgling campaign.

The decision has been taken to tap into the best practices and key resources that helped India win its war against polio, as per the WHO’s official release.   Vital role  Speaking about the initiative, Dr Harsh Vardhan, Minister of Health and Family Welfare stated in the official release: “Time and again the Government of India and WHO together have shown our ability, competence and prowess to the whole world. With our combined meticulous work, done with full sincerity and dedication, we were able to get rid of polio.”  He further added: “Today I would like to remind you of your potential and ability, and the big things we can do together. All of you in the field – IDSP, state rapid response teams and WHO - are our ‘surveillance corona warriors’. With your joint efforts, we can defeat the coronavirus and save lives.”  The Minister, along with Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia, was addressing WHO and other field staff, simultaneously connected from over 10000 sites all over the country – from capital cities to the remotest corners.  “The National Polio Surveillance Project (WHO-NPSP) played a critical role in strengthening surveillance for polio that generated useful, timely and accurate data to guide policies, strategies, and interventions until transmission of the poliovirus was interrupted in the country,” Dr Khetrapal Singh said. She added that the other WHO field staff involved with the elimination of TB and neglected tropical diseases and hypertension control initiative were also significant resources.  The Regional Director mentioned: “It is now time to use all your experience, knowledge and skills, with the same rigor and discipline that you showed while monitoring polio activities, to support districts with surveillance, contact tracing, and containment activities.”  She also urged the field staff to support the state and district governments.  She further commented that in the fight against the Covid-19, we have entered a stage where surveillance is going to play a vital role in making future strategies for containment.   Sharing information, best practices  The strengths of the NPSP team – surveillance, data management, monitoring and supervision, and responding to local situations and challenges – will be utilized to supplement efforts of NCDC, IDSP, and ICMR to strengthen Covid-19 surveillance.  WHO stated that the NPSP team will also support in sharing information and best practices and help states and districts calibrate their response based on transmission scenarios and local capacities.  WHO further informed most importantly, the WHO field staff will continue to support immunization and surveillance and elimination of TB and Neglected Tropical Diseases.

When tested in mice, the vaccine -- delivered through a fingertip-sized patch -- produced antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 at quantities thought to be sufficient for neutralizing the virus, said the team in a paper appeared on eBioMedicine which is published by The Lancet.  The authors are in the process of applying for an investigational new drug (IND) approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in anticipation of starting a phase I human clinical trial in the next few months.  If successful after human trials, the vaccine will still take more than a year to reach the market.  The team had previous experience on SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2014.  \"These two viruses, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, teach us that a particular protein, called a spike protein, is important for inducing immunity against the virus. We knew exactly where to fight this new virus,\" said co-senior author Andrea Gambotto, associate professor of surgery at the Pitt School of Medicine.  \"Our ability to rapidly develop this vaccine was a result of scientists with expertise in diverse areas of research working together with a common goal,\" added study co-senior author Louis Falo, professor and chair of dermatology at Pitt's School of Medicine and UPMC.  Compared to the experimental mRNA vaccine candidate that just entered clinical trials, the vaccine called \"PittCoVacc\" (short for Pittsburgh CoronaVirus Vaccine) follows a more established approach, using lab-made pieces of viral protein to build immunity.  When tested in mice, PittCoVacc generated a surge of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 within two weeks of the microneedle prick.  The researchers used a novel approach to deliver the drug, called a microneedle array, to increase potency.  This array is a fingertip-sized patch of 400 tiny needles that delivers the spike protein pieces into the skin, where the immune reaction is strongest.  The patch goes on like a Band-Aid and then the needles - which are made entirely of sugar and the protein pieces - simply dissolve into the skin.  \"We developed this to build on the original scratch method used to deliver the smallpox vaccine to the skin, but as a high-tech version that is more efficient and reproducible patient to patient,\" Falo said.  The system is also highly scalable, said researchers.  Mass-producing the microneedle array involves spinning down the protein-sugar mixture into a mold using a centrifuge.  Once manufactured, the vaccine can sit at room temperature until it's needed, eliminating the need for refrigeration during transport or storage.  \"For most vaccines, you don't need to address scalability to begin with,\" Gambotto said. \"But when you try to develop a vaccine quickly against a pandemic that's the first requirement.\"  The researchers point out that mice who got their MERS-CoV vaccine produced a sufficient level of antibodies to neutralize the virus for at least a year, and so far the antibody levels of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated animals seem to be following the same trend.  Importantly, the SARS-CoV-2 microneedle vaccine maintains its potency even after being thoroughly sterilized with gamma radiation - a key step toward making a product that's suitable for use in humans.  \"Testing in patients would typically require at least a year and probably longer,\" Falo said.  \"This particular situation is different from anything we've ever seen, so we don't know how long the clinical development process will take. Recently announced revisions to the normal processes suggest we may be able to advance this faster,\" the authors wrote.  It is the first study to be published after critique from fellow scientists at outside institutions that describes a candidate vaccine for COVID-19.

Ohio Chancellor of Higher Education Randy Gardner said universities would pursue policies to move nearly all students out of dormitories, except those who are former foster care youths, international students and those who have no place to move to. Ohio State University this week told students to begin moving out of its residence halls.  The latest numbers of confirmed cases in Ohio rose to 13: eight men, five women, ranging in age from 34- to 66-years-old. No one had died from the coronavirus in Ohio.   RELATED  What symptoms should you watch for  What steps to take to prevent illness  Explore What steps to take at home and how to plan  The Butler County General Health District on Friday announced that four of seven members of a family tested for coronavirus received positive results. The four who tested positive are quarantined at home, two awaiting test results are quarantined at home and one awaiting a result is in a local hospital.  Jenny Bailer, the health district’s director, said five of the family members are in their 30s and two are in their 70s. Officials said they are not classifying the cases as the result of community spread, and they’re working to learn more about how the virus was contracted.   Stopping spread  Dr. Acton said numerous interventions are being taken now to slow the spread of the virus so that Ohio’s health care system isn’t overwhelmed with a caseload spike.  “Somebody has this famous quote — on the front end of a pandemic you look a little bit like an alarmist, you look a little bit like a Chicken Little, the sky is falling. And on the back end of a pandemic, you didn’t do enough. That is your fate in my world.  Dr. Amy Acton, director of the Ohio Department of Health, and Gov. Mike DeWine gave an update Wednesday afternoon on the importance of the state’s coronavirus outbreak mitigation efforts. LAURA BISCHOFF/STAFF  That will be the fate of all of this because whenever a pandemic has come and gone or any infectious disease, a preparedness also has an end evaluation,” Dr. Acton said. Learning from previous pandemics informs what to do in future ones, she said.  Dr. Acton said there are four simple rules of what’s being implemented now:  — if you’re sick, stay home and isolate.  — if someone in your household is sick, you stay home too.   — practice social distancing.   — closing schools.  In the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918, St. Louis took early, aggressive action while Philadelphia waited two weeks to take the same measures, Dr. Acton said.  RELATED: Coronavirus Coverage: Get the latest on what to know   Working together  DeWine had a message for Ohioans who are hoarding toilet paper and other supplies. “I would tell people to be prudent. We’re all in this together. If you go in there and wipe out a whole shelf of whatever something is, it’s probably not helpful to your friends,” the governor said.  Ohio law gives the state Department of Health extraordinary powers when it comes to quarantine and isolation and the preservation of life and health. The state department as well as local health districts can rely on a long list of authorities, including police officers, to enforce quarantine and isolation orders.  Ohio has 114 local health departments that work in concert with state and federal public health authorities. Temporary boards of health were first established to respond to cholera epidemics in the 1830s in Ohio.   Getting a test  Sarah Hackenbract, president and CEO of Greater Dayton Area Hospital Association, said there have been people coming to area hospitals requesting a test for the coronavirus and that puts hospitals in a difficult position because it is not something an individual can request.  “People really need to work with their primary care provider, who knows them, who knows their health history, to know whether they need this particular test,” Hackenbract said.  Local hospitals are tracking capacity and monitoring supplies and information can be updated in real-time.  The board of trustees activated a regional task force for COVID-19. It includes the executive leadership of all of the hospitals in the region and their designated clinical leaders. The hospitals have activated their incident command systems.  She said capacity is not an issue at this time. She said it is a potential for concern with community spread, which is why hospitals are preparing for this and why officials are emphasizing that people keep a social distance to reduce the spread.   In Montgomery County  Health Commissioner Jeff Cooper of Public Health - Dayton & Montgomery County and other public officials provided said a number of steps are being taken to help the less fortunate in the county.  As the virus grows rapidly and unfolds across the country and globally, Cooper said, “we believe that as a system of partners gathered here today, that it is important to speak with one voice, one location and update our community so they don’t have to search multiple venues to get up-to-date information.”  RELATED: ‘Unprecedented’: Ohio makes sweeping changes to slow coronavirus spread  Jennifer Wentzel, director of the Montgomery County Environmental Health, said her group is working with restaurants and businesses to let them know what extra precautions they should take, including keeping point-of-sale areas clean as well as restrooms and areas where customers come into contact with. She noted that employers must be vigilant and recognize that sick employees must stay home.  Louis Connelly, a bartender at Lock 27 Brewing in downtown Dayton, hands one-time use paper menus to guests Wednesday. The disposable menus are a response to the concerns about the coronavirus. The restaurant has also removed communal salt and pepper shakers and mustard and ketchup bottles from the tables and offers plastic cups and cutlery. LISA POWELL / STAFF  She added that Public Health has recommended that salad bars and buffets at restaurants shutdown.  Dayton Municipal Court Clerk of Courts Mark Owens said municipal court judges issued an administrative order on Thursday to postpone eviction cases. The cases will not be heard until after April 30.  Mayor Nan Whaley said the city will suspend water shutoff to April 30 and help with food delivery to those in need. City officials are also working on strategies to help businesses that are hurting financially due to ramifications from the virus.
