In a Tweet shared on microblogging site Twitter on May 1, Friday, the Education Minister had urged students to send their education-related queries to him through the comment section of his tweet using #Educationministergoeslive.  A number of students raised their concerns in response to the education minister’s invitation on Twitter.  Some students suggested the minister to cancel all the board exams and asked him to promote the students on the basis of their internal marks. Some raised concern regarding the NEET UG entrance exam. “When are CBSE 12th boards and NEET 2020 going to happen? Will NEET be offline or online and will it be in phases?,” wrote a user. Some students from overseas also raised their concerns regarding the pending NIOS senior secondary examination.   Respected @HRDMinistry @DrRPNishank.

With more than 337,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus spread throughout 192 countries - including 1,642 in Australia alone - the nation has taken steps toward a total shutdown.  Brendan Murphy, Australia's chief medical officer, on Monday spoke of a new reality amid closures of pubs, bars, cinemas, gyms and restaurants.  'We are now in a different world,' he said.  'This world could last for some time... This is the world of social distancing. This is the new way of us interacting with each other all of the time.'  There have been 1,642 cases of coronavirus confirmed in Australia. This map shows the states which have closed off the borders to one another amid the crisis  Under the new social distancing and self isolation policies, Australians will have limited choices on activities in public.  Visiting most beaches, holding a play date in the park or throwing birthday parties and christenings will all be discouraged for at least the next six months while authorities try to wrangle the virus.  Similarly, stage one lockdown proceedings are underway across the nation, closing all restaurants, pubs and bars, as well as cafes, cinemas, places of worship and gyms.  For now, people are able to visit retail stores, hair salons and beauticians, however these may be restricted again if the government is forced to impose stricter lockdowns.  Another major difference in the 'new world' is the restrictions on interstate and international holidays. With school holidays fast approaching, families will no longer be able to take a quick trip away to celebrate.  Almost every domestic border has implemented strict control policies, including mandatory 14 day self isolation for any new arrivals.  SOCIAL DISTANCING: THE DOS AND DON'TS OF SELF ISOLATION DO: Create Home Workouts: With gyms closed, people are encouraged to keep active by working out at home. If you're not quarantined, you're able to go for a walk outside for exercise as long as you abide by the 1.5m social distancing policy. Get Creative: With the government encouraging people to spend more time indoors than ever before, it's a perfect opportunity to catch up on tasks you want done around the house. For little ones, its a great opportunity to do some arts and craft or baking. Contactless Delivery: Many delivery services are now giving people the option to choose a 'contactless delivery' - the best option for social distancing. Walk The Dog: Unless you've been ordered to stay indoors and self isolate due to concerns you could be carrying coronavirus, you should still take your dog for a walk - on your own. DON'T: The Beach: Any beaches where the government determined 500 or more people usually congregate have been temporarily closed. Walks along the beach, sandy picnics or going for a surf are not acceptable during self isolation. The Park: Parents should avoid taking their children to the park to play on any equipment or meet up with other friends during social distancing. Birthday Parties: People should refrain from throwing or attending parties until the threat of COVID-19 passes. Unnecessarily Travel: Unless there is an urgent need to leave home, or your suburb, it is best to stay put to avoid contracting the virus or passing it on to someone more vulnerable. Go To Appointments While Sick: At the moment, hairdressers and beauticians are still open. It is best to reschedule appointments if you're feeling unwell. Advertisement  Beachgoers are seen at Bondi Beach on Friday (pictured) despite the threat of coronavirus, leading to the temporary closure of the beach  Mr Murphy said it is imperative to public health that Australians begin taking social distancing policies more seriously.  Poll SHOULD AUSTRALIA ENTER A TOTAL LOCKDOWN AMID CORONAVIRUS CRISIS? YES NO SHOULD AUSTRALIA ENTER A TOTAL LOCKDOWN AMID CORONAVIRUS CRISIS? YES 1254 votes  NO 372 votes Now share your opinion  On Friday, thousands flocked to Bondi beach despite government orders to remain at a safe 1.5m distance from one another.  In response, Prime Minister Scott Morrison closed the beach - and many others - for the foreseeable future.  'Most Australians do the right thing but it is no longer acceptable to people to breach that,' Mr Murphy said.  He said the 'draconian measures' that were introduced overnight to close non-essential places of gathering, including places of worship, were agreed upon by all state leaders after concluding that Australians weren't taking the crisis seriously enough.  'There may be minor differences in interpretation, but the message is very clear. Do not get close to people other than your family, and do not go to gatherings where you are close to people.'  Mr Murphy discussed a 'social responsibility' to slow the spread of the virus by following public health advice.  'This is serious business now. Nobody can approach this in a cavalier way... I'm not directing that at young people, I'm directing that at all Australians.  Empty tables at a restaurant in Circular Quay in Sydney on Saturday. Bars, restaurants and cafes have all been forced to close dine in services  'You are putting the lives of vulnerable people at risk if you don't toe the line.'  In response to the growing threat of COVID-19, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced the state would join the Northern Territory, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania in closing the borders.  The ban will likely mean that anyone entering Queensland will have to isolate for 14 days.  Australia closed the borders to non-residents last week, but anybody returning home will be required to 'rigorously quarantine for 14 days,' Mr Murphy said.  'If you know anyone who has returned from overseas and is not quarantining, please come down very hard on them.  'The imported cases will slow down but the challenge in the coming weeks and months is to slow the transmission of the virus.'

An April Fools' Day prank that targeted Missouri schoolchildren in the middle of a global pandemic did not have state education officials laughing.  A letter circulating on social media Wednesday claimed public school students will not be able to move on to the next grade level during the 2020-21 year because of school closures and the cancellation of state-mandated exams.  The fake letter appeared to be on Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education letterhead. Late Wednesday, DESE responded.  The Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education posted this image late Wednesday to refute the April Fools' Day prank. (Photo: Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education)  \"We could not be more disappointed that someone chose to use their free time to create this document, illegally using our department logo, and make a joke about something as serious as students' education,\" DESE officials posted on Facebook.  \"This is particularly insensitive given the anxiety and uncertainty so many students and families are dealing with right now.\"  Missouri school districts closed last month to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. Area districts are hoping to reopen April 27, but a growing number of states have closed for the remainder of the 2019-20 year.  The fake letter signed Candice B. Fureal was addressed broadly to parents and stated state law makes it clear if students are unable to take the necessary final exams at the end of one school year, they will not be allowed to move onto the next.   The fake letter stated:  \"We are saddened that in these extraordinary times an exception could not be made to graduate each student to their next grade level & realize that this will be upsetting to most students, that's why we notified parents right away to discuss this with their children,\" the letter stated.  \"Be looking forward to a follow-up email from your school district regarding extra resources including additional services for counseling during this difficult time.\"  DESE officials were worried families might believe the letter, which looked official and reached out to the News-Leader and other media outlets.  Mallory McGowin, communications coordinator for DESE, refuted the letters' claims.  \"That is not true,\" she said, by email. \"This letter is fake and, unfortunately, part of an insensitive and disappointing April Fools' Day joke.\"  Claudette Riley is the education reporter for the News-Leader.

The problem can affect those using Windows 10 May 2019 Update, or November 2019 Update, and is caused by Microsoft’s KB4535996 cumulative update (which is an optional update deployed late February).  The bug may prevent Office 365, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Teams – and other software besides, including Microsoft’s web browsers – from connecting to the internet, with obvious issues therein for those working from home using these apps in these troubled times.  Microsoft notes that any software which uses WinHTTP or WinInet might (and note that use of the word might – the problem isn’t guaranteed to manifest) experience issues reaching the internet.  The caveat is that many of those affected by this issue are using a VPN, and these are the folks most likely to be hit by the gremlin. But of course those working from home, and having to log on to remote systems and work with sensitive business data, are those most likely to be using a VPN for the better security it provides.  Apparently the problem can happen when either connecting to, or disconnecting from, a VPN.  Microsoft explains: “Devices using a manual or auto-configured proxy, especially with a virtual private network (VPN), might show limited or no internet connection status in the Network Connectivity Status Indicator (NCSI) in the notification area.  “This might happen when connected or disconnected to a VPN or after changing state between the two.”   Fix imminent?  In terms of a fix, Microsoft is prioritizing this as you might imagine, rushing a patch out the door before the usual scheduled monthly release, and it should be available in early April we are told.  Meantime, the more positive news is that there is a very easy potential workaround, and that’s simply to reboot your machine. This may or may not work, but at least it’s not a difficult thing to do.  On the other hand, if you have to keep doing it throughout the working day, that could obviously be pretty frustrating, and you’ll potentially be wasting a fair amount of time looking at the boot screen or the desktop loading up. And of course this isn’t a guaranteed solution – although at least it’s a low-effort mitigation.  The update that Microsoft has acknowledged as the origin of the problem, KB4535996, applied a number of fixes including a solution for a problem where the Windows search box doesn’t render properly, and it also improved battery performance for laptops in Modern Standby mode.  Sadly, as too often seems to be the case with Microsoft’s cumulative updates for Windows 10 these days, it gave with one hand, and took with another, introducing this fresh net connectivity bugbear.  The timing of the emergence of this Windows 10 flaw is obviously problematic, but with any luck those who are suffering at the hands of this bug will get a solution perhaps as soon as next week, depending on exactly how early in April Microsoft is targeting for a resolution.

(Eric Gay/AP Photo)  Oil Futures Fall Below Zero for First Time in History  Oil futures prices fell below zero for the first time in history, as a market glut fueled by the economic fallout from the pandemic drove a selloff by traders desperate to avoid taking delivery of physical supplies of the commodity.  May futures contracts of U.S. crude, which trade as West Texas Intermediate (WTI), fell $55.9, or 306 percent, to settle at a discount of $37.63 a barrel after touching an all-time low of minus $40.32 a barrel.  When a futures contract expires—which takes place on Tuesday in the case of May contracts of WTI—traders must decide whether to take delivery or roll their positions into an upcoming contract.  “If you don’t have storage, you have to get out,” explained oil economist and consultant Phil Verleger.  WTI crude futures contracts are typically settled financially, but those that haven’t been closed out after expiry and failing special arrangements are liquidated by physical delivery. These would typically go to America’s key crude oil storage hub and delivery point at Cushing, Oklahoma, which is rapidly filling up.  Crude oil storage tanks are seen from above at the oil hub, in Cushing, Oklahoma, on March 24, 2016. (Nick Oxford/Reuters)  “The storage is too full for speculators to buy this contract, and the refiners are running at low levels because we haven’t lifted stay-at-home orders in most states,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.  With much of the global economy at a standstill due to the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus, a novel coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19, physical demand for crude has dried up, leading to a supply glut. This despite the fact that some OPEC countries and Russia recently agreed to production cuts.  Meanwhile, the difference between the expiring May WTI contract and the coming June WTI contract widened to a record at more than $60 a barrel intraday Monday. This suggests that traders believe that as the pandemic runs its course, demand for oil—and its price—will jump later in the year.  “If you can find storage, you can make good money,” said Reid I’Anson, economist for market-data firm Kpler Inc., in remarks to The Wall Street Journal.  The extreme price move showed how much excess supply there is compared to available storage capacity in the U.S. oil market, for which WTI is a proxy.  Brent crude, the international benchmark, also fell on Monday, but those moves were minor compared to WTI because more storage is available worldwide.  Meanwhile, crude oil volatility, or OVX, which is a measure of price fluctuations in this commodity, spiked by over 128 percent intraday Monday to previously unseen levels of over 220.

In some cases, yes.  “Isolation for public health purposes may be voluntary or compelled by federal, state, or local public health order,” the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say on its website.  People with high risk of exposure to the virus causing COVID-19 – for example, they’ve traveled to China’s Hubei Province or live with a symptomatic person without taking the recommended precautions – could face quarantine or isolation under public health orders, the CDC says.  Isolation occurs when a person is known or believed to be infected with a disease and potentially infectious. It’s the process of separating known sick people from those who are known to be not sick. An isolated person is usually told to stay in a separate room from other people in their homes and use a separate bathroom.   - ADVERTISEMENT -  Quarantine occurs when a person may have been exposed to a disease but is not yet symptomatic. It restricts their movement to see if they become sick.  Like the Missouri case, many cases of quarantine or isolation amid the coronavirus outbreak have been recommended or done so without the force or law. Breaking these does not mean jail time or fines.  St. Louis County Executive Sam Page said the man and his family were asked to self-quarantine when his daughter became symptomatic. Page said officials relied on “common sense and goodwill,” assuming the whole family would comply.  However, the father and his other daughter went to a school dance. According to KTVI-TV, the two left the dance after they learned of the presumptive positive test result that day.  Who has the authority to impose quarantine or isolation?  According to the CDC, the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution grants the federal government isolation and quarantine authority.  The Secretary of Health and Human Services can take actions to prevent the spread of communicable disease from foreign countries into the United States and between states.  For example, American passengers on Princess Cruises’ Diamond Princess were evacuated and brought to U.S. military bases for 14-day quarantines.  Within states’ borders, state and local health officials have quarantine and isolation enforcement power, the CDC says.  “These laws can vary from state to state and can be specific or broad. In some states, local health authorities implement state law. In most states, breaking a quarantine order is a criminal misdemeanor,” the CDC writes.  In New York, for example, mandatory or precautionary quarantines or isolations may be imposed amid the coronavirus outbreak. According to the Staten Island Advance, under a mandatory quarantine or isolation, local health officials must visit the home at least once a day and be in electronic contact once a day. Precautionary quarantines only require electronic communication.  “When we say you are on precautionary quarantine that is a serious situation. We are assuming that you will act in good faith and that you will be following the rules of voluntary quarantine,” Cuomo said, per the newspaper.  According to a 2018 paper in the Journal of Public Health Management and Practice, most states allow for a person to have a hearing concerning a mandatory quarantine, though few allow for the person to choose their medical provider.  So what actually happens if you break a quarantine or isolation?  Fines and imprisonment are possible punishments for breaking a federal quarantine, the CDC says; however, federal quarantines are rarely used.  On state and local levels, the laws vary. Just over half of states have “police powers” to enforce public health actions, according to the Journal of Public Health Management and Practice paper.  For example, violating Michigan’s Public Health Code means a person could face fines up to $200 and up to six months in jail, or both, said Lynn Sutfin, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.  “The penalty for a violation of the Code, an order of a local health officer, or an order of the Department is a misdemeanor,” she said.   ___   © 2020 USA Today  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 16, "joy": 4, "negative": 9, "disgust": 1, "positive": 10, "anger": 12, "surprise": 1, "fear": 17, "trust": 5}, "metadata": ["self-quarantine", "coronavirus", "virus", "province", "precautions", "quarantine", "isolation", "cdc", "infected", "outbreak", "united", "princess", "diamond", "criminal", "mandatory", "precautionary", "cuomo", "violating", "michigan"]}, {"text": "Authored by Nick Hankoff via The Libertarian Institute,  Cash has been the target of the banking and financial elites for years. Now, the coronavirus pandemic is being used to frighten the masses into accepting a cashless society. That would mean the death of what’s left of our free society.  CBS News, CNN, and other mainstream outlets are fearmongering again. Alarmism is nothing new in the media world, but this time, it’s not about triggering panic buying or even pushing a political agenda.  The war on cash is about imposing a new meta-narrative. As economist Joseph Salerno explains, the cashless society forces all payments to be made through the financial system. It doesn’t end with monopoly control over transactions, though.  Being bound to computers for transactions kicks the door wide open to hardcore surveillance of personal activity and location data. Being eternally on the grid means relentless taxation and negative interest rates, which the Federal Reserve is already gearing up for.  None of this bothers the well-heeled boosters of a cashless society or their lackeys in the media. They want Americans reading about the threat of coronavirus cooties on their cash, which is absurd.  Germs, of course, can loiter all over credit and debit cards, smartphones, ATMs, and every other cash alternative device. Too bad implanted microchip technology isn’t further along, the banksters must be thinking.  Fear of coronavirus-tainted dollars opens a new front in the war on cash https://t.co/0aDsgLyNev — Los Angeles Times (@latimes) March 12, 2020  In another CNN article, readers are practically shamed for withdrawing cash to save during a crisis. Every sentence, every word, every letter of the article is nuts.  It begins by reassuring the reader that their bank account is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). There’s no mention of moral hazard from CNN. The fact that the federal government guarantees every bank account up to $250,000 encourages reckless financial and banking behavior. Not worth mentioning, CNN?  Prior to the end of World War II, there were $500, $1,000, and $10,000 bills in wide circulation. This cash was dissolved by the Federal Reserve in the name of fighting organized crime. This same argument is now being made against $50 and $100 bills by Harvard economics professor Kenneth Rogoff.  In the Wall Street Journal, Rogoff also wrote that a cashless society would offer such benefits as “greater flexibility for the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy when necessary.”  He wrote those words in 2017. And these too:  “The Federal Reserve should be able to implement negative nominal interest rates vastly more effectively in the absence of large bills, which could prove quite important as a stimulative tool in the next financial crisis.”  Prophetic. And indeed, negative interest rates would require the assistance of outlawing cash, so that banking customers don’t cheat by simply drawing out on their accounts.  Pardon the pun, but it’s absolutely sick how COVID-19 is being used now as a launching pad for this cashless agenda. There’s nothing to fear about using cash during this time of social distancing.  Wash your hands after handling cash, but don’t give up your moolah. Preserve your health, your privacy, and your liberty.  And just in case you wondered what all this fearmongering has done for that dirty cash in circulation - Americans are grabbing it at at the fastest pace since the Y2K liquidity scare...  Another unintended consequence of government intervention.

This comes as UK ministers are expressing doubt that the coronavirus originated from Wuhan’s Hunan Seafood market and rather insist that there is credible evidence it came from Wuhan’s lab, which also had U.S. funding.  The documentary led by investigative reporter Joshua Philipp takes an in-depth look at the progression of the pandemic from January to April, and details how Shi Zhengli a virologist often called China’s “bat woman” altered studies throwing the world’s science community off the trail in order to support her claim that the Wuhan coronavirus virus (COVID-19) came from bats at the market. The film also dissects the virus in great detail exposing its spike (or S-proteins), which has layers of HIV-1 gp120 included in it and its nucleoids and amino acids, to the history of the Wuhan lab’s experiments on bats. Additional claims are made that China has covered up much of the earlier information about the virus, in some cases even ordering documents destroyed. The film by Philipp proves without a doubt, at least to this writer, that the virus is a biological escaped experiment.  This is something that Activist Post has been raising as a strong possibility to readers, despite alternative press being attacked for claiming the virus displayed signs of being a biological weapon produced in a lab. Dr. Francis Boyle, a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law, and the man who drafted the Biological Weapons Act of 1989, recently said in an explosive interview with Geopolitics and Empire that the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan likely came from the BSL-4 lab in the city.  Boyle stated in the interview that he believes the virus is potentially lethal and an offensive biological warfare weapon or dual-use biowarfare weapons agent genetically modified with function properties. Boyle also touched on a fact this reporter stated previously — how Chinese biowarfare agents working at the Canadian lab in Winnipeg were involved in the smuggling of coronavirus to Wuhan’s lab in July of last year.  Recently, scientists have now admitted and found that the coronavirus kills the immune system by attacking T-cells; This alludes to a confirmation of earlier reports retracted by Indian scientists that ZeroHedge reported which stated COVID-19 SARS2 had four new sequences matching HIV-1 gp120 inserted into its spike or S-proteins. Dr. Judy Mikovits a molecular biologist and former director at the lab of Antiviral Mechanisms NCI, makes the same argument in Epoch Times‘ film, stating that: “the virus is certainly not natural, given the S-proteins and E-proteins.”  Mikovits isn’t the only molecular biologist speaking out; Czech Dr. Sona Pekova is also working on the tests for the virus and stated that it’s likely an escaped lab experiment due to the modified proteins.  Ministers in UK are now no longer dismissing the theory that the coronavius pandemic erupted due to a biological experiment gone wrong, or a deliberate release, The Dailymail reported. “There is a credible alternative view [to the zoonotic theory] based on the nature of the virus. Perhaps it is no coincidence that there is that laboratory in Wuhan. It is not discounted.” Cobra the emergency committee led by recently infected recovering Borris Johnson, said.  Even the Pentagon, which had previously flatly dismissed the possibility, now seems at least open to other considerations according to a recent statement cited by Defense One:  “There’s a lot of rumor and speculation in a wide variety of media, blog sites, etc.,” (Joint Chiefs Chairman) Milley said. “It should be no surprise to you that we have taken a keen interest in that, and we have had a lot of intelligence take a hard look at that.” “At this point it’s inconclusive, although the weight of evidence seems to indicate natural, but we do not know for sure,” Milley said.  The approximate £30 million Wuhan Institute of Virology, based ten miles from the infamous wet market, is supposed to be one of the most secure virology labs in the world. A second institute in the city, the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention – is barely three miles from the accused market – is also believed to have carried out experiments on animals such as bats to examine the transmission of coronaviruses. The Wuhan Institute of Virology was involved in carrying out research on bats from the Yunnan caves which scientists believe is the original source of the outbreak, Dailymail reported.  Beyond that, it has now emerged that several U.S. state department cables warned of safety issues of the lab, Washington Post reported.  WaPo reports that the U.S State Department received two cables from U.S. Embassy officials in 2018 warning of inadequate safety at a Wuhan, China biolab conducting “risky studies” on bat coronaviruses, according to the Washington Post, which notes that the cables have “fueled discussions inside the U.S. government about whether this or another Wuhan lab was the source of the virus.” Interestingly enough, this coincides with a warning that same year from a major U.S. government report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine which warned that advances in synthetic biology now allow scientists to have the capability to recreate dangerous viruses from scratch; make harmful bacteria more deadly; and modify common microbes so that they churn out lethal toxins once they enter the body.  It has also emerged that Wuhan’s Virology Institute was funded for 3.7 million by the NIH (National Institutes of Health) headed by none other than Anthony Fauci. Results of the research were published in November 2017 under the headline: “Discovery of a rich gene pool of bat SARS-related coronaviruses provides new insights into the origin of SARS coronavirus.”  This may explain why despite the virus has been claimed to be airborne and able to spread a now reported 13 feet. Regardless, the U.S. or any country has refused to say the virus may be an escaped lab experiment. The FBI also discussed several suspicious encounters where Chinese nationals were trying to smuggle viruses out of the U.S., including a coronavirus, as Activist Post reported.  This doesn’t include the case in January, where the head of Harvard University’s chemistry department, Charles Lieber, was federally charged with failing to disclose funding from the Chinese government, after he hid his involvement in China’s “Thousand Talents Program,” along with Chinese nationals. It also doesn’t include an incident in a Canadian lab in Winnipeg where coronavirus samples were smuggled to Wuhan’s lab in July of last year by a couple. Typically, Canadian and U.S. authorities work hand in hand; in 2001 after the September 11 attacks the agency established a permanent presence in Ottawa, Canada for terrorism and cross-border related cases.  The FBI’s report also specifically uses the words, “biosecurity risk” when describing China, which is typically used to refer to the intentional misuse of pathogens, such as for bioterrorism and biosafety, which covers accidental release according to the World Heath Organization.  The Lancet medical journal published a study finding that many of the first cases of the novel coronavirus, including suspected patient zero, had no connection to the wet market, leading many including Boyle to speculate with abundant evidence listed above that the virus may have been a bio accident. Lancet also makes note that there are no bats sold at the Wuhan Seafood market, as the CDC themselves admitted. Many suspect “patient zero” was actually Shi Zhengli’s assistant Huang Yan Ling, who has gone missing and was suspiciously removed from the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s website as Laowhy86 noted in a YouTube video investigating the coronavirus’s origins entitled: “I Found The Source of the Coronavirus.”  Zhengli has denied that Ling was patient zero, expressing it was “fake news” that her or any other researcher was infected. However, Chinese media has continued the investigation whether or not patient zero was Ling or another researcher. South Chinese scientists have raised concerns as well, expressing that there were two separate lab incidents with the coronavirus-infected bats, one spilling blood and the other spilling urine on lab workers, as Activist Post reported.  Ironically, one of those South Chinese scientists was Xio Botao, a researcher who purportedly knew Ling and called her in his report “Patient Zero.”  It is worth noting the lab was officially working with different strains of coronavirus, as well as other deadly illnesses like Ebola, beginning in 2018. This lab is just a few miles away from the Huanan wet market where the first case of the coronavirus is believed to have been transmitted.  Even before the lab opened, scientists all over the world were voicing concerns about the potential dangers. An article was published in the prestigious science journal Nature in 2017, detailing the plans for the lab and sharing expert opinions about how a dangerous bug could leak from the facility. In fact, the SARS virus has escaped from high-level containment facilities in Beijing multiple times.  Interestingly enough, in 2004, China punished five top officials of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the outbreak of SARS. The investigation found that the release of the virus was due to the negligence of two CDC employees who were infected and was not deliberate, China Daily reported.  ZeroHedge pointed out that a job post from the Wuhan Virology Institute on November 18th , 2019 asked for researchers to “use bats to research the molecular mechanism that allows Ebola and SARS-associated coronaviruses to lie dormant for a long time without causing diseases.”  What was missed at the time by many of us is that the same job post board has another shocking post on December 24th 2019, which states the following:  Long-term research on the pathogenic biology of bats carrying important viruses has confirmed the origin of bats for major human and animal infectious diseases such as SARS and SADS, and discovered and identified a large number of new viruses in bats and rodents.  In 2015, the National Library of Medicine published a paper warning that a “SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronavirus pose threat for human emergence.” That same year, Nature published an article warning that a hybrid lab-created version of a bat coronavirus — one related to the virus that causes SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) — could cause a possible pandemic.  In 2020, another paper was published in Nature, which claimed that the Wuhan coronavirus is closely related to (CoVZC45 and CoVZXC21) sampled from bats from Zhoushan by the People Liberation Army of China. The E-protein and NSP7 shows 100% amino acid similarity to CoVZC45 and 89.1% similarity to nucleoids of the CoVZC45 virus which, according to Mikovitz, proves it is not a natural virus. Further, she adds, the S-proteins also show a similarity to the original SARS.  According to the documentary by Epoch Times and NTD, the following research further illustrates the origins of the Wuhan coronavirus.  On January 23, 2020 the Wuhan virus exploded. While Wuhan announced the lockdown of the city, Dr. Shi Zhengli of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, published a paper in the authoritative science journal, Nature on February 3, 2020 stating that the Wuhan coronavirus was of probable bat origin. The paper indicated that the Wuhan virus utilized the same key as SARS to gain entry into the human body. She also announced the 2019-nCoV genome sequence was 96.2% consistent with a bat coronavirus originating in Yunnan, China, called RaTG13, signaling a natural source of the Wuhan virus. Since the SARS outbreak in 2003, Shi Zhengli had been conducting research on coronaviruses. From 2010 onward, the focus of Shi and her team, was redirected to identifying the capacity for coronavirus transmission across species, specifically putting the spotlight on the S protein of the coronaviruses. Her team’s research in the Wuhan virology lab, has been looking into the part that can make coronaviruses transmittable to humans. In June, 2010, a team including Shi Zhengli, published a paper. It described research to understand the susceptibility of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ACE-2 proteins, of different bat species to the S Protein of the SARS virus. In the experiments, they also modified key amino acid codons to mutate the bats ACE-2 to examine compatibility with the SARS S Protein. This paper demonstrated their awareness of the special relationship between the S Protein and the ACE-2 receptor. It also signified that Shi had unearthed the passageway for coronaviruses into human bodies. In October, 2013, Shi and her team published a paper in Nature. They claimed a breakthrough in coronavirus research. They successfully isolated three viruses from bats, one of which had a S Protein that integrated with human ACE-2 receptors. This effectively demonstrated the direct human infection of SARS-like viruses to humans, without the need of an intermediate host. Then in November, 2015, Shi and her team at the Wuhan virology lab once again published a paper. This time in the British journal, Nature Medicine. They discussed the creation of a synthetic virus, a self-replicating Chimeric virus. This virus had the SARS virus as the framework, with the key S protein replaced, by the one they had found in a bat coronavirus, she mentioned in her 2013 paper. This new virus demonstrated a powerful ability for cross-species infection. The mice infected with the synthetic virus revealed severe lung damage with no cure. This symbolized that Shi’s successful splicing of the SARS virus, was a key to open the door to the cross-species transmission. They planned to further experiment on primates, although Shi Zhengli did not indicate any conclusion from this research. Her move to research on primates wasn’t done without controversy. Shi’s experiments quickly triggered widespread debates from the academic community. Simon Wain-Hobson of the Pasteur Institute in France, expressed deep concerns. He told Nature, “If the new virus escaped, nobody could predict the trajectory. Propagation could happen anywhere.  It is worth noting that on February 7th, Chinese Major General Chen Wei, China’s chief biochemical weapon defense expert, the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences and “Director of the Institute of Biological Engineering” took over the Wuhan Virology Institute P4 laboratory according to Xilu a Chinese Military website. That’s not all, China’s leader Xi Jing Ping called for the inclusion of bio security into China’s National Security framework, and to accelerate the introduction of a bio security law, South China Morning Post reported.  CONFIRMED UNFORTUNATELY – Chinese Military Website Xilu – China's chief biochemical weapon defense expert enters Han to fight the epidemic! The decisive battle begins:https://t.co/z2k2GzmbPU https://t.co/A5vePJGuDT — ⒶK #FreeAssange #BOT⌛🏴‍☠️🎗️‏(₿)🍀 (@An0nAKn0wledge) February 9, 2020  Symptoms of the coronavirus include a fever, cough, shortness of breath, and other breathing difficulties. However, according to Chinese state media, some are not experiencing any of these symptoms and are instead experiencing nausea, diarrhea, tiredness, bad concentration, headache, irregular heartbeat, chest pain, cornea inflammation, and muscular pains in the limbs, back, and waist. There are also emerging suspected symptoms; for example, French scientists have warned that COVID-19 may cause dermatological problems such as hives, painful red skin and a condition similar to frostbite.  Best preventive measures include washing your hands, and avoiding public places where someone may be sick, according to the CDC.  Since the virus outbreak was officially announced in January, scientists have found a multitude of everlasting damage caused to our bodies including but not limited to — heart problems, liver damage, kidney damage, brain damage, and lung damage. This has many scientists and doctors perplexed and worried about the coronavirus and its effects on our current and future health. British scientific advisers have even estimated the pandemic may be as much as 15 to 40 times worse than what China has said.  According to a leaked audio recording by Epoch Times, a Chinese military expert who spoke to military medics revealed that in recovered patients, the immune system is totally destroyed and they could remain contagious. He added, “do not expect a vaccine, let me tell you. Do not expect there’ll be a vaccine. Those who talked about how vaccines can be developed are all charlatans. Those who have been infected will have a lot of trouble. (Now that it has spread far and wide,) what’s next, how it will develop later, no one has a clue. This virus, in fact, is how humans are going to self-destruct. There is absolutely nothing we can do about it.” However, he added, that the only solution is to “increase your own personal immunity.”  Moreover, the South China Morning Post issued a new warning to lab technicians around the world. According to French scientists in a new (non-peer-reviewed) paper, they had to bring the temperature almost to a boiling point in order to kill the virus.  Professor Remi Charrel and colleagues at the Aix-Marseille University in southern Franceheated the virus that causes Covid-19 to 60 degrees Celsius (140 Fahrenheit) for an hour and found that some strains were still able to replicate.  China lied about SARS previously, which was a biological accident 3 out of the 4 times according to the World Health Organization. So, with all this evidence pointing back to China, using Occam’s razor we can determine that the virus more than likely leaked from Wuhan Institute of Virology, especially given the infectious spread infecting every country in the world in a matter of months.  Ironically, and something you can take as predictive programming or a warning from Hollywood, the 2011 movie Contagion is about a bat coronavirus which escapes China and ravages the world without a cure according to IMDB.  However, as Activist Post wrote while discussing the increase of a police surveillance state, measures being put into place now will likely remain long after the pandemic has stopped and the virus has run its course. That’s the everlasting effect that COVID-19 will have on our society. Essentially, we are entering COVID-1984. The coronavirus is now classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, and it may very well be a legitimate health concern for all of us around the world and the virus itself may be an escaped lab experiment as this article details. But it’s the government’s response that should worry us all more in the long run like increased phone surveillance and talking “pandemic drones.”  You can watch the full investigative documentary by the Epoch Times and NTD entitled: “Tracking Down the Origin of the Wuhan Coronavirus” below.

Markets in Asia and Europe sank along with U.S. futures as more governments tightened restrictions to fight the pandemic.  Fears grew that densely crowded New York could become one of the world’s biggest coronavirus hot spots, prompting cancelations of everything from play dates to picnics in the park to pickup basketball games. The city’s mayor said hospitals were 10 days away from shortages in “really basic supplies” that seriously endangered both health care workers and patients.  “If we don’t get the equipment, we’re literally going to lose lives,” Mayor Bill de Blasio told CNN.  A surge in infections has caused a critical shortage of medical supplies in many places. Italy has already seen 18 doctors with coronavirus die. A senior Spanish health official called the infection of 3,910 health care workers, roughly 12% of the country’s total cases, “very bad news.”  To combat this, Spain erected a field hospital in a convention center. British health workers pleaded for more gear, saying they felt like “cannon fodder.” U.S. President Donald Trump ordered mobile hospital centers be sent to Washington, California and New York. In France, doctors scrounged masks from the unlikeliest of places — an architect, construction workers in Breton, factory floors.  “There’s a wild race to get surgical masks,” François Blanchecott, a biologist on the front lines of testing, told France Inter radio. “We’re asking mayors’ offices, industries, any enterprises that might have a store of masks.”  Health care workers say they are being asked to reuse and ration disposable masks and gloves. A shortage of ventilators, crucial for treating serious COVID-19 cases, has become critical as has a lack of test kits to comply with the World Health Organization’s exhortations to test as many people as possible. In the United States, a fierce political battle over ventilators has emerged, especially after Trump told state governors to go find their own medical equipment and some strongly replied that was not the best solution.  China has been the one nation to counter this trend, sending planeloads of medical equipment like masks, gloves and protective gear as well as doctors to countries across Europe, including hard-hit Italy, France and Spain as well as countries with weaker medical systems like Bulgaria, Greece and Serbia.  “The U.S. is completely wasting the precious time that China has won for the world,” said Geng Shuang, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman.  Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, promised that medical supplies are about to start pouring in and will be “clearly directed to those hot spots that need it most.”  But efforts for a quick aid package from Congress faltered. The U.S. Senate voted against advancing a nearly $2 trillion economic rescue package. Democrats argued it was tilted toward corporations rather than workers and health care providers. Another vote was expected Monday.  The delay shook investors, as has the accumulation of canceled events large and small, the soaring numbers of unemployed and a widespread pullback in spending. U.S. futures slipped more than 3% on Monday and stocks fell in Paris, Frankfurt and London after a brutal session in Asia.  Governments everywhere are grappling with how to keep essential supplies flowing as their economies slow to keep the virus from spreading. French President Emmanuel Macron urged employees in supermarkets and other essential businesses to keep working despite the threats to their health.  “We need to keep the country running,” Macron said.  Worldwide, nearly 350,000 people have been infected and 15,000 have died from the virus that first emerged in central China late last year. As cases in China ebbed, the dangers to Europe and the U.S. have grown exponentially, although Germany on Monday cautiously reported some flattening of its infection curve.  After just a few weeks, the U.S. has more than 33,000 cases and more than 400 deaths.  For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever or coughing. But for some older adults and people with existing health problems it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Over 100,000 people have recovered, mostly in China.  Authorities kept up their push to get people to stay home but some were clearly not listening.  Photos showed long lines of parked cars as hundreds walked up the remote mountains of Snowdonia National Park in Wales, which saw“its busiest-ever visitor day” on Saturday. The park on Monday urged the British government to be more explicit in its advice so people “protect themselves and others.”  British Health Secretary Matt Hancock described those ignoring the government’s social distancing recommendations as “very selfish” and warned that stricter rules might be coming soon.  “If people go within two meters of others who they don’t live with, then they’re helping to spread the virus,” he said. “And the consequences of that costs lives.”  Italy’s infections continued to spike, hitting 59,000 cases and 5,476 deaths, and India’s prime minister asked, with mixed results, his nation of 1.3 billion people to stay home. The arrival of the global pandemic in Syria as well as the Gaza Strip has raised concerns it could run rampant in some of the most vulnerable areas in the Mideast.  Two former passengers of the virus-infected Diamond Princess cruise ship died, bringing to 10 the number of deaths from a ship that had over 700 infections and stands as a prime example of how not to contain an outbreak. With weddings and other large gatherings banned in many places, an untold number of burials are going forward with nothing more than a minister, a funeral home staffer and one loved one to bear witness.  Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky became the first U.S. senator to announce he was infected, joining the likes of celebrities like opera superstar Plácido Domingo. German Chancellor Angela Merkel put herself into quarantine after a doctor who gave her a pneumonia vaccine tested positive.  With no end in sight to the global uncertainty, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe acknowledged that postponing this year’s Summer Olympics could be unavoidable. Canada and Australia added to the pressure on Olympic organizers by suggesting they wouldn’t send athletes to Tokyo this summer. The International Olympic Committee said it would examine the situation over the next few weeks.  “If it is difficult to hold in a complete way, a decision of postponement would be unavoidable,” Abe said.  While other countries struggled to contain the virus, the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus outbreak first emerged, said Monday it’s now allowing residents limited movement as its months-long lockdown gradually eases.  But even after scientists in London predicted that the pandemic’s death toll could easily top 1 million people in the U.S. alone — and that is the best-case scenario — some world leaders were still not yet convinced of the scope of the threat.  Trump suggested that the remedies to fight the pandemic — including worldwide financial pain — may be more harmful than the outbreak itself, and vowed to reassess government restrictions after the 15-day mark of the U.S. shutdown.  “WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,” he tweeted.

(AP Photo/Koji Sasahara)  Canadians Stuck on Cruise Ship in Japan ‘Expected’ to Fly Home Feb. 20  Canadians stranded on a quarantined cruise ship were told that a flight set to bring them home is “expected” to depart Tokyo Haneda Airport on Feb. 20 amid an outbreak of the novel coronavirus.  Passengers will be informed of the “exact departure time approximately 24 hours before the flight,” reads an email received by passengers aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked at a port near Tokyo.  “It is important that you remain on the ship until you are instructed to board the assisted Canadian flight, even if you are cleared to leave because you have completed the ship quarantine,” says the email received during the evening local time on Feb. 18 from Global Affairs.  “Please note that if you leave the ship before you are instructed to do so, it will not be possible to board the assisted Canadian flight.”  Should passengers choose not to return on the charter flight, they will need to complete the current quarantine being administered by Japan and follow the instructions of local authorities, it says.  Canadians seeking to return to home by commercial means will be subject to the Quarantine Act, in line with a determination to be made by the Public Health Agency of Canada, it says.  This could include a further quarantine of 14 days, it reads.  An email sent Feb. 17 in the evening said it took the government time to organize this evacuation because the flight departure from Lisbon was delayed by “several hours due to overflight clearance challenges.”  On Feb. 18, Global Affairs issued a statement saying: the plane had resumed its journey to Tokyo after “unforeseen technical issues in departing from Europe.” No additional details were provided.  “It will land in Tokyo where passengers will be screened before boarding as planned. More information to follow as it becomes available,” Global Affairs said.  As many as 255 Canadians are on the Diamond Princess, where some 3,500 passengers have been stuck for at least 10 days. So far, 355 people have been infected, including 15 from Canada.  The largest number of cases outside China is among passengers and crew of the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The Japanese Health Ministry has tested 1,723 people among the 3,700 initially on board, and 454 have tested positive.  The U.S. evacuated 338 American passengers early on Feb. 17, with most of them placed in a 14−day quarantine at military bases in California and Texas.  Global Affairs Canada said on Feb. 15 that the aircraft will bring passengers from Japan to Canadian Forces Base Trenton in southern Ontario.  There they will be assessed and transported to the NAV Canada Training Institute in Cornwall, Ont., to undergo a further 14−day period of quarantine.  Before boarding in Japan, passengers will be screened for symptoms, it said adding those who exhibit symptoms of COVID−19 will not be permitted to board and will instead be transferred to the Japanese health system to receive appropriate care.  Experts have questioned if the close quarters have contributed to the virus’ spread.  Lolita and Hans Wisener of Red Deer, Alta., who have so far not shown symptoms of the virus say they are looking forward to being on the plane.  “I feel better having gotten some news because it feels like we’ve just been sitting and waiting for two days,” Lolita Wisener said.  “Things are moving even if it’s slow but knowing helps. It looks like it’s going to be another two days.”  Another passenger, Trudy Clement, said she’s a bit worried although neither she nor her husband have shown symptoms.  “It’s the stress,” she said.  “It’s bad enough just waiting for this day to finally come but waiting for that knock on the door to finally say you’re not going because you tested positive is horrible. It’s a horrible, horrible feeling.”  Her husband will be spending his birthday in quarantine on March 1, in Ontario.  “We’ll order a cake, I don’t know, Clement said.  “As long as we get out of here, it’s fine. Home is always home.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 22, "joy": 5, "negative": 11, "positive": 16, "anger": 2, "fear": 7, "trust": 4}, "metadata": ["diamond", "cruise", "stranded", "outbreak", "princess", "global", "quarantine", "china", "japanese", "ministry", "initially", "california", "canada", "institute", "symptoms", "virus"]}, {"text": "NEW YORK (AP) — New York’s governor urgently appealed for medical volunteers Monday amid a “staggering” number of coronavirus deaths, as he and health officials warned that the crisis unfolding in New York City is just a preview of what other U.S. communities could soon face.  “Please come help us in New York now,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said as the state’s death toll climbed by more than 250 people in a day to a total of over 1,200, most of them in the city. He said an additional 1 million health care workers are needed to tackle the crisis.  “We’ve lost over 1,000 New Yorkers,” Cuomo said. “To me, we’re beyond staggering already. We’ve reached staggering.”  Even before the governor’s appeal, close to 80,000 former nurses, doctors and other professionals were stepping up to volunteer, and a Navy hospital ship, also sent to the city after 9/11, had arrived with 1,000 beds to relieve pressure on overwhelmed hospitals.  “Whatever it is that they need, I’m willing to do,” said Jerry Kops, a musician and former nurse whose tour with the show Blue Man Group was abruptly halted by the outbreak.  He returned to his Long Island home, where he volunteered to be a nurse again. While waiting to be reinstated, Kops has been helping at an assisted-living home near his house in Shirley, N.Y.  The spike in deaths in New York was another sign of the long fight ahead against the global pandemic, which was filling Spain’s intensive care beds and shutting millions of Americans inside even as the crisis in China, where the outbreak began in December, kept easing.  More than 235 million people — about two of every three Americans — live in the 33 states where governors have declared statewide orders or recommendations to stay home.  In California, officials put out a similar call for medical volunteers as coronavirus hospitalizations doubled over the last four days and the number of patients in intensive care tripled.  “Challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days, and this is a very vital 30 days,” President Donald Trump told reporters. “The more we dedicate ourselves today, the more quickly we will emerge on the other side of the crisis.”  In Europe, meanwhile, hard-hit Italy and Spain saw their death tolls climb by more than 800 each, but the World Health Organization’s emergency chief said cases there were “potentially stabilizing.” At the same time, he warned against letting up on tough containment measures.  “We have to now push the virus down, and that will not happen by itself,” Dr. Michael Ryan said.  More than three-quarters of a million people worldwide have become infected and over 37,000 have died, according to a count by Johns Hopkins University.  The U.S. reported more than 160,000 infections and over 3,000 deaths, with New York City the nation’s worst hot spot. New Orleans, Detroit and other cities also had alarming clusters.  “Anyone who says this situation is a New York City-only situation is in a state of denial,” Cuomo said. “You see this virus move across the state. You see this virus move across the nation. There is no American who is immune to this virus.”  Some hospitals are now parking refrigerated trailers outside their doors to collect the dead. At two Brooklyn hospitals, videos posted by bystanders and a medical employee showed workers in masks and gowns loading bodies onto trailers from gurneys on the sidewalk.  Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious-disease expert, also warned that smaller cities are likely about to see cases “take off” the way they have in New York City.  “What we’ve learned from painful experience with this outbreak is that it goes along almost on a straight line, then a little acceleration, acceleration, then it goes way up,” he said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”  In other developments around the world:  — Bells tolled in Madrid’s deserted central square and flags were lowered in a day of mourning as Spain raced to build field hospitals to treat an onslaught of patients. The death toll topped 7,300.  — In Japan, officials announced a new date for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics — summer of 2021 — as a spike in reported infections fueled suspicions that the government had been understating the extent of the country’s outbreak in recent weeks while it was still hoping to salvage the Summer Games.  — Moscow locked down its 12 million people as Russia braced for sweeping nationwide restrictions.  — Israel said 70-year-old Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is quarantining himself after an aide tested positive for the virus. In Britain, Prince Charles, the heir to the throne who tested positive, ended his period of isolation and is in good health, his office said.  Italy’s death toll climbed to nearly 11,600. But in a bit of positive news, the numbers showed a continued slowdown in the rate of new confirmed cases and a record number of people recovered.  “We are saving lives by staying at home, by maintaining social distance, by traveling less and by closing schools,” said Dr. Luca Richeldi, a lung specialist.  At least six of Spain’s 17 regions were at their limit of intensive care unit beds, and three more were close to it, authorities said. Crews of workers were frantically building more field hospitals.  Nearly 15% of all those infected in Spain, almost 13,000 people, are health care workers, hurting hospitals’ efforts to help the tsunami of people gasping for breath.  For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause severe symptoms like pneumonia. More than 160,000 people have recovered, according to Johns Hopkins.  In China, the crisis continued to ease. It reported Monday 31 new COVID-19 cases, among them just one domestic infection, and the city at the center of the outbreak, Wuhan, began reopening for business as authorities lifted more of the controls that locked down tens of millions of people for two months.  “I want to revenge-shop,” one excited customer declared.  Japanese automaker Toyota halted production at its auto plants in Europe, but all of its factories in China resumed work Monday.   ___  Associated Press writers around the world contributed to this report.

There still are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nueces County, a point both Corpus Christi Mayor Joe McComb and Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District Executive Director Annette Rodriguez stressed.  \"This is an effort to stay ahead of the spread,\" Rodriguez said.  Officials emphasized that the test is not for the general public, and residents will not be allowed at the testing center without a health-district issued appointment.  \"First and foremost, people need to understand that this testing center is not going to be just for 'We're open to the public,' kind of drive-through at the Whataburger,\" said McComb.  A statement from the City of Corpus Christi confirms what McComb told KRIS 6 News early Sunday afternoon -- that a scene that included barricades around the old Christus Spohn Memorial Hospital, and people in protective gear in the area -- was a test run conducted to test the effectiveness of the vacant hospital as a mobile COVID-19 testing site.  With no warning as to what was happening in their neighborhood, however, residents were alarmed.  \"They, uh, have people in these suits, and it's just concerning to us that we're not notified of what's going on in our neighborhood,\" said area resident Carmen Pruett.  Courtesy photo/Laura Salas People in protective suits gave residents in the neighborhoods around the disused Christus Spohn Memorial Hospital a scare Sunday morning.  McComb apologized for worrying people, saying it was unintentional, and that not informing residents had been an oversight.  \"I would be as surprised if I'd be driving down the street and see somebody out there standing around in a HAZMAT suit, so I apologize for that on behalf of the group,\" he said.  The purpose of Sunday's exercise was to \"get all the bugs worked out before we just announce it to the world,\" he said. \"We're trying to make it as smooth as possible.\"  Nueces County Judge Barbara Canales said the test was a success, and had been conducted by \"a cohort of 10 individuals,\" but it is unknown who, if anyone, was tested.  Qualifying for testing is a procedure city and county officials are calling a \"two-step.\"  The first step is to call the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District at (361) 826-7200, where an assessment will be done to decide whether a potential patient meets testing criteria set forth by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).  If the patient is determined to be a candidate for testing, the second step will be to set up an appointment to be drive-through tested at the old trauma hospital.  “This two-step self-assessment and telephone screening process is critical to ensure efficient and timely treatment to those who need attention,” said Public Health Director Annette Rodriguez in a statement. “Those meeting the symptoms criteria then will be given information on testing.”  Canales said the model, announced by Gov. Greg Abbott and available in a few other major cities, will adopt best-practice guidelines set forth by the CDC and will adhere to HIPAA privacy standards.  The test will have potential patients pull up in their cars for testing once given an appointment by the health district.

REPORT  Advertisement Coronavirus forces new approaches to fighting wildfires Share Shares Copy Link Copy  They are two disasters that require opposite responses: To save lives and reduce the spread of COVID-19, people are being told to remain isolated. But in a wildfire, thousands of firefighters must work in close quarters for weeks at a time.Wildfires have already broken out in Texas and Florida, and agencies are scrambling to finish plans for a new approach. They are considering waivers for some training requirements to previously-certified crew members, and moving some training online.Other proposals include limiting fire engines to a driver and one passenger, requiring other crew members to ride in additional vehicles. They may scrap the normal campsite catering tents in favor of military-issue MREs, or “Meals Ready to Eat” to reduce touching serving utensils.Federal resources for firefighting efforts may be more scarce, leaving states to deal with more fires.In light of the “unprecedented challenge” of the pandemic, Forest Service resources will be used “only when there is a reasonable expectation of success in protecting life and critical property and infrastructure,” says Forest Service Chief Victoria Christiansen.Wildland fire camps have always had a reputation for spreading illness. Norovirus outbreaks have occurred and outbreaks of illnesses collectively dubbed the “camp crud” are yearly occurrences for many.The job is so demanding that it’s typically done by younger, healthy and physically fit people. But the nature of the job also works against them: firefighters regularly experiencing high stress, inhaling smoke and dust and dealing with poor sleeping and personal hygiene.A suck-it-up and tough-it-out culture doesn’t help either, said Jessica Gardetto, spokeswoman for the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. The center coordinates logistics for 14,000 federal firefighters and thousands more state, local and private crews.“\"We have really been trying to educate and change that culture because not just in this situation but in others, it’s not OK to just tough it out if something's wrong,\" she said.You don't have to look too far back in history to see how the one-two punch of a pandemic and wildfire can decimate communities. The 1918 influenza pandemic killed an estimated 50 to 100 million people worldwide. In October 1918, sparks from a passing train ignited fields near Cloquet and Moose Lake, Minnesota.Four hundred and fifty people were killed in an area that spanned 1,500 square miles (about 3,885 square kilometers). There were 21,000 injuries and 52,000 displaced people, said Curt Brown, a journalist and the author of “Minnesota, 1918.” The aftermath made it easy to spread disease.“It was the perfect situation to spread the flu -- if you were lucky enough to survive the wildfire, you were crammed into evacuee housing,” he said. At least 100 people died of the flu in evacuee housing, an estimate Brown called conservative.There also are concerns about preparations not being done. Typically, agencies spend months and millions of dollars preparing for wildfire season — clearing brush and doing prescribed burns to reduce the plants that feed massive wildfires.That’s not happening in many places because some fire managers are trying to allow employees to abide by social distancing guidelines as long as possible and to curb smoke from the prescribed burns during the pandemic. Smoke can make breathing more difficult for people with asthma and other lung conditions.“The biggest issue I see right now is that the prescribed burns aren’t getting done,” says Casey Judd, the president of the Federal Wildland Fire Services Association, which advocates on behalf of federal firefighters in 42 states. “That’s going to increase the fire load.”He said leaders should have started working on a coronavirus plan for firefighters months ago. “I’m not suggesting they’re dragging their feet, but obviously they’re trying to figure it out just like everyone is,” he said.Kerry Greene, an emergency management specialist and spokeswoman with the U.S. Forest Service, said that although the plans haven’t been released yet, they’re coming together. The agency is already working to follow directives from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as infectious disease guidelines created in 2008 after a bird flu epidemic.Like many, fire managers are to some extent flying blind. “Some of the things we’re probably going to have to learn as we go,” Greene said.For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.Wildland firefighters are first responders just like hospital staff and police, and should be protected accordingly, said , said Boise State University assistant professor Luke Montrose, an expert in community and environmental health. “Like potentially having them wear masks when traveling from place to place.”Under the $2 trillion federal CARES Act, federal fire crews will have paid sick leave for the first time, she said, which officials hope will encourage crew members to take sick leave when they need it. It’s not clear if all state or contract firefighters will have the same benefit.Scott McLean, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said the agency is following strict physical distancing protocols, and that could mean making larger campsites near wildfires and pulling in additional trailers for showers and other hygiene needs. But there is no agency-wide guidance beyond the recommendations every American has been given for the pandemic, he said.“It has to be handled on a case-by-case basis because every incident is different. We rely on each individual to be responsible, and we have safety officers on the teams,” McLean said. “We will meet those needs as they come.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 13, "positive": 32, "negative": 15, "sadness": 1, "disgust": 5, "joy": 7, "anger": 10, "surprise": 1, "fear": 25, "trust": 12}, "metadata": ["reporting", "virus", "deadly", "coronavirus", "texas", "expectation", "spreading", "experiencing", "pandemic", "flu", "distancing", "guidelines", "curb", "suggesting", "specialist", "infectious", "mild", "cough", "pneumonia", "hospital", "university", "professor", "masks", "spokesman", "california", "strict"]}, {"text": "Cape Cod’s year-round residents, alarmed by an influx of out-of-state license plates amid the coronavirus outbreak, are petitioning for the shutdown of the Bourne and Sagamore bridges — to keep out vacation homeowners and avoid overwhelming their small hospitals.  A Change.org petition to close the bridges, which had nearly 5,000 signatures by Monday afternoon, states: “Stop the spread of covid-19 close the bridges. only year round residence, medical personnel. Trucks that deliver essential supplies. While we love our tourists and summer residents this is not the time to come to the cape, out hospital can’t handle it. We only have 2 small hospitals here on cape, and limited medical staff.  keep the residences and elderly safe on cape.”  “We feel like sitting ducks, and nobody has our back,” said Chatham resident Nancy Patterson, who’s over 65. “This is an emergency, and we should only be allowing in essential vehicles. It’s just getting scary out here.”  And it isn’t just the Cape that’s worried about the potential for incoming coronavirus cases.  In the Berkshires, state Rep. William “Smitty” Pignatelli, D-Lee, said he called Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito asking that the Baker administration shut down on the short-term rental industry, including companies like Airbnb, as people in western Massachusetts worry about travelers coming in from nearby New York.  “For someone to promote a Berkshire COVID-19 getaway with free toilet paper is making light of a dangerous situation,” said Pignatelli, saying he saw such an ad that has since been removed. “We’re not prepared to have an influx of people during a pandemic, not only from a public health standpoint, but from a public safety standpoint. We’re not equipped to deal with this and we haven’t even reached the peak.”  When asked if Baker is considering implementing such restrictions during a press conference Monday, he said, “We will have more to say about that shortly.” His office declined to provide more detail on when to expect an announcement or what measures Baker is considering.  Airbnb spokeswoman Kelley Gossett cited efforts the company has made to combat the virus, such as hosts who have opened their homes for free to medical workers and others who need safe places to stay and self-isolate near hospitals.  When asked about the proposals to cut off the Cape, Baker’s office referred to his Friday advisory that all travelers entering the state self-quarantine for 14 days.  More strict policies like Rhode Island’s efforts to obtain out-of-staters’ contact information “sends a similar message,” Baker told reporters, adding that, “we’re not going to take any options off the table.”  Officials from Cape Cod Healthcare and the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce recently wrote an open letter to Cape Cod second homeowners, telling them to self-quarantine for 14 days if they come to the Cape during the coronavirus crisis.  Officials in the Berkshires are urging visitors to stay away during the outbreak, noting the lack of space at their hospitals ahead of an expected surge in two weeks. Pignatelli made a distinction when it comes to second homeowners, but Great Barrington Selectman Stephen Bannon noted that any out-of-state people who do go to the Berkshires should arrive with enough supplies to quarantine for two weeks.  “Our first choice is that people don’t come here because we simply don’t have the medical capacity,” Great Barrington Selectman Ed Abrahams said, noting there are only 25 beds at the local Fairview Hospital, which is “working frantically” to expand to 50.  Executive Director Jenn Nacht of the Lenox Chamber of Commerce said the group is “not comfortable at this time with visitors coming to the Berkshires for refuge,” also excluding people who own second homes there.  People should remain isolated until the end of April, Nacht said, and “not put a burden on other communities that will already become stretched taking care of residents.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 19, "positive": 14, "negative": 5, "disgust": 1, "joy": 3, "anger": 2, "surprise": 1, "fear": 5, "trust": 2}, "metadata": ["coronavirus", "shutdown", "hospital", "elderly", "massachusetts", "travelers", "advisory", "self-quarantine", "strict", "options", "healthcare", "noting", "surge", "quarantine", "beds", "excluding"]}, {"text": "A Kentucky couple has died from the coronavirus.

You might see people being willing to help others even when they are at risk themselves, acting courageously in conscience.  The coronavirus pandemic is no different. While you might see more coverage in the mainstream media about people fighting over toilet paper, here are 5 recent instances of kindness coming into play during the outbreak.  1. NJ Resident does grocery runs  Going from store to store collecting groceries for people in need, Bloomfield, New Jersey resident Abraham Dickerson is doing his part.  “Why did I start? Because I care,” the good Samaritan said. “I didn’t want to see anyone go hungry or possibly risk their life going to get food.”  Dickerson’s gesture means a lot to the people he is assisting.  An elderly woman named Barbara Brooks explained how Abraham helped her get groceries. Her residence is a tower where seniors live, and she has to deal with asthma. She was advised to be distant from others as much as possible.  “It means that someone cares,” she said. “I’m almost out of breath.”  A resident named Adeleri Onisegun noted “He’s not asking for anything, he’s not expecting anything, he’s not taking anything.”  2. Civilian prevents a shooting outside the grocery store  Even though many are warm and helpful, it must be expected that crime may rise.  When people battle over food or whatever it is outside the grocery store for example, and somebody pulls out a weapon and tries to strike the innocent, it might inspire a courageous reaction from bystanders.  It was a situation like this that recently transpired in Omaha, Nebraska.  A man entered an Omaha, Nebraska Hy-Vee store and started firing shots, when bystander Tom Wenzl tackled him and disabled the threat to everybody in the vicinity.  Customers were running out of the store, but he stayed and ducked down out of sight behind a counter. “I hunkered down – he was in five or six – I crouched and waited. When he came through, that’s when I tackled him,” Wenzl explained.  He actually prevented a cop from having to take lethal action, because Omaha Police Deputy Police Chief Scott Gray said he was a “fraction of a second from shooting the guy,” as he also jumped into the altercation. That was after Wenzyl initially started trying to wrestle the gun away, with the first move.  3. “Take this.” $1000 handed to grocery store staff  At Darrell’s Market & Hardware in Aurelius Township, Michigan, employee Julie Huguelet was walking out the door after a long shift when a stranger handed her an envelope.  “Take this. Give $10 a day to each of your employees” he said, without giving his name or any more information.  Without opening the envelope, she took it to the owner of the store, Jared Browers. “There’s a thousand dollars cash in here,” Browers noted after opening it.  They explained the pace of business had “doubled” at the store and that traffic is like not like anything they’ve ever seen before, in the midst of this situation surrounding the pandemic. “A lot of us are getting to the point where we’re just exhausted,” said Huguelet. “We crash and go home and sleep, then come back.”  Store owner Jamie Robinson said the gift meant a lot.  Robinson said after a long week, many employees were in disbelief when they heard about the anonymous $1,000 donation.  “Is this for real?,” some asked her. “Did this really happen?”  “It was a pretty amazing thing,” Robinson said. “It really boosted the staff.”  “It’s just really going to be a nice reaffirmation of the work we do every day,” Browers said.  4. At the location of a fight, woman gifts toilet paper  A more negative story received publicity recently about people allegedly attacking each other with wine bottles at a Sam’s Club in Hiram, Georgia, in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area.  At this same store, WSBTV Atlanta explained: “A Paulding County woman shared a sweet story of strangers helping strangers during the coronavirus pandemic.”  Carol Burton Largent said that she went to Sam’s Club to get some toilet paper, something notoriously out of stock these days.  Largent asked a woman next to her when she pulled up at the store if there was any toilet paper left.  “I asked her if they had any toilet paper left and she said no, it was all gone. Then she proceeded to open her pack of toilet paper and gave me 24 rolls without even thinking about it,” she said.  Largent said she told the woman she didn’t have any cash.  “I don’t need your cash, God put you here for a reason,” Largent said the woman said.  5. Pandemic Partners do grocery runs  A Facebook group is emphasizing community power while maintaining respect for the need to be cautious of spreading illness.  A post in a group called Pandemic Partners Southern Oregon offered to visit the store for people who are over 60 years old, or suffer from a weakened immune system. Members of the community offering to visit stores for people in need, that’s surely a practice that we can look forward to continuing.  Another post in the group offered help to those suffering from illness by giving them bone broth, considered highly nutritious.  People in the group are offering handmade face masks to health care workers, posting job listings, food pantry availability, meals for kids and first responders, and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings to help their neighbors through a difficult time.  It’s a wonderful example of community spirit.

Johnson's Conservative government vowed weeks ago to rapidly increase the number of tests for the new coronavirus to 10,000 a day, then 25,000 a day by mid-April. But progress has been slow. The government says 10,412 tests were performed Tuesday, the first time the daily target was met.  Like some other countries, the U.K. has limited virus testing to hospitalized patients, leaving people with milder symptoms unsure whether they were infected. Many scientists say wider testing \" especially of health care workers \" would allow medics who are off work with symptoms to return if their results are negative, and would give a better picture of how the virus spreads.  Johnson tested positive for the virus a week ago and revealed last Friday that he had mild symptoms of COVID-19 disease. He has continued working while in self-isolation and promised in a video message that the government was 'massively increasing testing.'  Testing 'is how we will unlock the coronavirus puzzle. This is how we will defeat it in the end,' Johnson said.  Opinion polls suggest Britons have been largely supportive of the government's efforts to contain the new coronavirus. Johnson ordered residents to stay home except for a handful of permitted circumstances and ordered the closure of schools, bars, restaurants and non-essential shops.  But as the number of virus-related deaths in the U.K. accelerated in recent days, the unity behind the government's response is shattering. The country had more than 29,800 cases and more than 2,350 deaths as of Thursday, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally.  The right-leaning Daily Mail newspaper slammed the 'testing fiasco' on its front page Thursday. 'Questions without Answers,' said the Conservative-supporting Daily Telegraph, accusing the government of being unable to say why Britain lagged behind its European neighbors on testing.  Critics compare Britain's approach to testing unfavorably to the one in Germany, which has the ability to test 500,000 people a week and has reported fewer deaths among people with the virus  The government says testing front-line health care workers is a priority, and it set up five drive-through test centers to do it. But they had tested only 2,800 people by Thursday, from a National Health Service workforce of more than 1 million.  Paul Cosford, emeritus medical director of Public Health England, acknowledged that 'everybody involved is frustrated that we haven't got to the place where we've got to get to.'  Part of the problem is Britain's centralized state-funded health system, which is fairly efficient at organizing hospital treatment but poor at rapidly boosting testing capacity. All coronavirus tests were initially processed at a single Public Health England laboratory, though several other public labs are now also handling the tests.  British officials also blame shortages of swabs to take samples and of chemicals known as reagents, which are needed to perform the tests, for the delay in ramping up testing.  But private-sector firms and academic institutes say their offers of help have so far been ignored.  Paul Nurse, chief executive of the Francis Crick Institute for biomedical research, said its laboratory had been repurposed so it could carry out 500 tests a day by next week, rising to 2,000 a day in future.  He compared the effort required to the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of British troops from the French port of Dunkirk as it was overrun by German forces in 1940 \" a rescue that saw hundreds of small private boats join the navy in plucking soldiers from the beaches.  \"We are a lot of little boats. and the little boats can be effective,' Nurse said. \"The government has put some big boats, destroyers in place. That's a bit more cumbersome to get working and we wish them all the luck to do that, but we little boats can contribute as well.\" ___  Follow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 16, "positive": 14, "negative": 9, "anger": 6, "fear": 9, "trust": 2}, "metadata": ["london", "british", "minister", "boris", "johnson", "government's", "coronavirus", "virus", "symptoms", "mild", "self-isolation", "closure", "restaurants", "non-essential", "deaths", "hopkins", "university", "britain", "european", "paul", "acknowledged", "hospital", "initially", "england", "samples", "institute", "2,000", "french", "ap", "pandemic"]}, {"text": "Despite the number of novel coronavirus cases globally and the measures being taken by = national government to curb the spread there are still some unanswered questions about the disease. RFI English spoke to Professor Vincent Marechal, a virology expert and director of the Life Science Department at the faculty of sciences and engineering at Sorbonne University to throw light on these issues.  Q1. What is the the novel coronavirus?  Sars-Cov2 is one of the seven human coronaviruses we know of. Four of these have been present for many years and have been associated with mild upper respiratory diseases. In some rare cases they cause severe infections in infants, young and elders. They are mainly present during winter.  The three other coronaviruses - SARS-Cov (2002) with a lethality of 10 percent, MERS-Cov (2012) with 37 percent and the newly discovered Sars-Cov2 - are much more dangerous. Sars-Cov-2 - the agent of COVID19 - is genetically closer to SARS-Cov.  In all these cases, the transmission occurs from person to person through droplets in the air from an infected person coughing, sneezing or talking. The virus can also be transmitted by contaminated hands. That's why it's so important to wash hands thoroughly.  Q2. What is the difference with 'flu?  The human viruses are broadly classified into enveloped and naked viruses. Virus particles covered with a membrane are called enveloped. These are usually more fragile compared to the naked viruses.  Both the influenza virus and the coronaviruses are of the enveloped type. These kinds of viruses are supposed to be sensitive to soap, alcohol, dryness and heat. They do not persist in an infectious form for a long period of time out of the body and require close direct or indirect contact to disseminate among people.  However, the two diseases are quite different. COVID19 is asymptomatic or poorly symptomatic in most cases (80 percent). The severity of COVID increases with age and with co-factors such as chronic diseases (notably respiratory diseases), immunosuppression, diabetes, hypertension and others.  Children can be infected as well but clinical complications are very rare. So far, there's no specific treatment nor a vaccine. One should keep in mind that the novel coronavirus is a brand new virus for humans.  In the case of influenza, the virus is virulent both in children and old people (even in people of intermediate age). However, the fatality rate for the seasonal flu (0.1%) is much lower than that of novel coronavirus (from 2 to 5% depending on the way infected patients are evaluated).  Q3. The symptoms are similar for both the diseases?  It's difficult to distinguish between the symptoms for the two diseases. It should be reminded that in the winter season, there is not only the seasonal flu and (this year) Covid-19 but also other viruses responsible for respiratory syndromes. Therefore the initial symptoms are not that specific: both can cause fever, cough, body aches, and fatigue.  To distinguish between both viruses, you need to conduct a specific test (a molecular test named RT-PCR can be performed to detect novel coronavirus in nasopharyngeal swab). This test can be done if there are a limited number of cases in a specific area.  But as the number of infections climbs, it is difficult to conduct these tests in a systematic way for mild symptoms or to detect asymptomatic carriers.  Q4. Will Covid-19 turn into a seasonal disease just like flu?  One hypothesis is that the novel coronavirus circulation will reduce in spring and summer. It is not proven yet, but in this aspect it could be similar to the flu virus or to other common coronaviruses which circulate during winter.  Two factors enable the spread of flu during winter: it is less sensitive to cold temperature and in winter, people spend more time in the interiors thus facilitating the circulation of the virus.  Of course, we must keep in mind that the virus is new and the number of cases is going through the roof. That's because there is no immunity to the virus in the population.  Q5. Has novel coronavirus undergone any mutations?  Already, it is not a single virus but a population of closely related viruses. Genetically, it's almost the same. As of now, we don't have arguments to say a particular variation will make it more lethal or give it advantage. Generally speaking, random mutations or genetic variations are not good for the virus because it may destroy some essential genes. Only a few genetic variations will provide the virus with an advantage, such as an increased ability to circulate among humans.  Normally, modifications that promote the transmission would likely be selected. This does not mean that the virus' virulence will increase. It's a basic evolutionary step. It's not necessarily advantageous for the virus to kill more people.  A virus with high lethality means the patients will be isolated from the population, they will block transmission. It's not certain that such a virus will have an advantage to circulate. On the other hand, a mutation that makes the virus more contagious but less visible will give it a chance to survive longer. Of course, this is an overly simplistic model.  Q6. Have those who have recovered from novel coronavirus developed immunity?  If we look at China, the number of cases seems to have gone down. The epidemic is slowing down as expected. There could be a couple of reasons; either there hasn't been enough counting or people have developed immunity and slowed its spread.  We expect people who have recovered to become immune. Of course, we have to take care of how the virus could change over time. But as of now, there's no evidence to suggest that the virus is escaping the immune response.  Q7. Where are we in terms of vaccines and therapeutic care?  Vaccines won't be available quickly. It will take at least one year or so. But antiviral drugs can be produced relatively quickly. By using the so-called repositioning technique, researchers are testing the already proven Ebola or HIV drugs the outbreak. And there have been encouraging results in the laboratories.  Q8 How long does Sars-Cov-2 survive on surfaces?  The survival of viruses on inert surfaces depends on two important parameters. One is the material of the surface and the second is the initial number of infectious particles. The higher the number, the longer it takes for the surface to be virus free.  The rate of degradation of the virus on a surface is constant over time. Some experiments have shown that for other coronaviruses, for 1000 particles on a table in a classroom, it takes 5 to 7 days for it to disappear completely. If there are only 10 particles, they get destroyed in 1 day.

On Saturday, thousands of protesters gathered in the state capitals of Texas, Indiana, New Hampshire, Maryland and elsewhere, demanding relaxation of the stay-at-home orders which have left millions jobless. Other protests in dozens of states are already being planned in the coming weeks.  Several hundred people rallied in Texas' capital of Austin on Saturday, chanting 'Let us work!'

'No matter what you do for the Do Nothing Democrats, no matter how GREAT a job you are doing, they will only respond to their Fake partners in the Lamestream Media in the negative, even in a time of crisis,' Trump fumed, recalling what he said was an unpleasant phone conference between Senate Democrats and Vice President Mike Pence on Friday.  'They were RUDE and NASTY,' Trump said. 'This is their political playbook, and they will use it right up to the election on November 3rd. They will not change because they feel that this is the only way they can win.'  Other protests took place across the country on Saturday. In Indianapolis, more than 200 people stood close together outside the governor's mansion, carrying American flags and signs demanding that Governor Eric Holcomb, a Republican, lift restrictions.  'Our goal is to lift up our voices so that the governor will lift his unconstitutional restrictions because his cure is worse than the disease,' organizers of the Indiana protest said in a statement. 'The government cure has done more harm than the disease!'

More than 200 cars circled the statehouse, honking horns and waving banners and American flags.  Dolores, a hairdresser in Maryland, said she is not eligible for unemployment because she is a business owner, not an employee.  'I need to save my business. I need to work to live.

The crowd included several armed men wearing military-style uniforms, with their faces covered.  'Even if the virus were 10 times as dangerous as it is, I still wouldn´t stay inside my home. I´d rather take the risk and be a free person,' said one of the New Hampshire protesters, talk show host Ian Freeman.

'Somebody sitting in their boat on a lake should be ok. They shouldn't arrest people,' Trump added, referring to Michigan's stay-at-home order which prohibits jet skis, motorboats or other comparable watercraft but allows for canoes, sailboats and kayaks.  In a tweet, Whitmer fired back, saying: 'Right now, despite having the 10th largest population, we have the 3rd highest COVID-19 deaths in the nation. I'm using every tool at my disposal to save lives, and it's working. The curve is flattening.'  'Remember: COVID-19 is the enemy, not each other,' she added.  Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer fired back, saying: 'Right now, despite having the 10th largest population, we have the 3rd highest COVID-19 deaths in the nation. I'm using every tool at my disposal to save lives, and it's working.'  It follows Trump's incendiary tweets on Friday demanding to 'LIBERATE' Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia, three potential swing states with Democratic governors.  Trump also talked at length about testing capacity, saying that the U.S. has 'tremendous testing capacity' after governors argued that relaxing social restrictions would be disastrous until testing is much more widely available.  Trump said that more than four million tests had been conducted nationwide, which is the equivalent of about 1.2 percent of the U.S. population.  The president claimed that the country has 'tremendous unused capability' and that many states are not using testing kits properly, utilizing only a fraction of the capacity of high-throughput tests.  'Unfortunately some partisan voices are attempting to politicize the issue of testing which they shouldn't be doing,' he said.  'This was a military and private enterprises march. We marched and unfortunately they're viewing it as an election,' Trump added. 'This should not be a partisan witch-hunt like the Russia witch-hunt.'  Trump said that some states had requested massive numbers of ventilators that they had never ended up needing. He also pointed out that the military had built thousands of field hospital beds in New York City that are now going mostly unused.  Across the country, protests have been mounting calling on governors to relax shutdown orders and allow people to go back to work.  Trump said that Texas and Vermont will allow certain businesses to reopen on Monday while still observing coronavirus-related precautions and Montana will begin lifting restrictions on Friday.  'We continue to see a number of positive signs that the virus has passed its peak,' Trump told reporters at the briefing.  Some state governors have warned that they will not act prematurely to reopen their economies until there is more testing for the virus, however.  Business leaders have also told Trump the country needs to have widespread testing in place before their companies can return to normal operations.  On Saturday, Trump said 'our testing is getting better and better,' but offered no concrete evidence.  He said both Republican and Democratic governors 'have announced concrete steps to begin a safe and gradual phased opening.'  Texas and Vermont 'will allow certain business to open on Monday while still requiring appropriate social distancing precautions,' he said.  On Saturday morning, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York, epicenter of the U.S. epidemic, said his coronavirus-battered state may finally be past the worst of the health crisis there.  Trump is pushing to relax the U.S. lockdown by May 1, a plan that hinges partly on more testing.  Public health officials said the ability to test enough people and trace contacts of the infected is crucial before easing restrictions, and that infections could surge anew unless people continue to take precautions.  Vice President Mike Pence delivered a commencement address at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado, a trip aimed at showing the country is on course to gradually reopen.  Trump said of the graduating Air Force officers: 'they're being very politically correct, standing not six feet but ten feet apart.'  Covid anger splits US: Texas crowd chants 'fire Fauci' and armed demonstrators swarm New Hampshire state house demanding lockdown be lifted while anti-Trump protesters in New York dump fake body bags outside president's properties  Protestors at an anti-lockdown rally in Texas yelled 'fire Fauci' in a targeted chant against President Trump's top medical advisor, as thousands of Americans defied stay-at-home and social distancing orders at rallies.  Meanwhile, anti-Trump activists launched counter-protests outside of the president's properties and laid body bags on the ground.  Hundreds of protestors gathered at the capitol building in Austin on Saturday to fight the state's coronavirus stay-at-home orders. The Texas protest was organized by Owen Shroyer and attended by Alex Jones from Infowars.  Cell phone footage from the protest showed people hoisting Trump 2020 flags and anti-lockdown signs into the air while calling for the dismissal of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top immunologist and infectious disease expert.  Since the global disease was first detected in Washington state, Dr. Fauci has become a leading public health expert in President Trump's coronavirus response.  Protestors in Austin, Texas, screamed 'fire Facui' in a targeted chant against Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top immunologist and infectious disease expert  Pictured: Infowars host Alex Jones, who helped organize the protest, marches with protesters during the \"Reopen America\" rally on Saturday  Fauci is often seen near Trump during daily briefings and COVID-19 press conferences where he updates the public on health developments.  The crowds chants come after Trump publicly showed support for the anti-lockdown protests and repeatedly contradicted Facui's public health recommendations.  Texas announced that it would be the first state to re-open amid the COVID-19 pandemic next week.  Retailers will be able to open again next Friday but on a to-go basis, meaning they must deliver to people's homes, cars or other places.  A woman who helped organize a COVID-19 anti-lockdown protest in New Jersey was charged for defying stay-at-home orders on Friday, authorities said.  The New Jersey Attorney General's office said Kim Pagan, of Toms River, was charged with violating emergency orders after she organized a protest against the state's lockdown in Trenton.  Gov. Phil Murphy first implemented the coronavirus emergency orders last month. New Jersey has at least 78,467 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 3,840 deaths.  Video shared to Facebook by Central Jersey Libertarians showed a police officer writing summonses as protestors shout and honk their cars' horns near the statehouse.  Cell phone footage taken from the protest showed a New Jersey police officer writing summonses as upset protesters yelled and defiantly honked their car horns  On Friday, anti-lockdown protestors in Trenton, New Jersey, held a rally hitting back at Gov. Phil Murphy's coronavirus emergency lockdown orders that have closed nonessential businesses and mandated stay-at-home orders  'We have a right to peacefully protest,' one woman shouted, as the officer walked by a car window that reads 'playdemic.'  State stay-at-home protests also popped up in a Walmart parking lot in Hamilton. Protesters arrived with signs, American flags and wrote anti-lockdown messages on car windows, NBC New York reports.  One window read: 'MURPHY'S LAW WORSE THAN COVID-19.'  Gov. Murphy said New Jersey's coronavirus curve has not yet plateaued.  He said: 'Even if the rate of our increase is lessening, which it's hard to argue it hasn't over the past week, we have two realities that we cannot escape. One is it is still increasing.  'So with all due respect to this notion that we've found some plateau, we're not at any plateau.'  New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (pictured) instated COVID-19 lockdown orders last week as he told residents cases have not yet plateaued  In recent days, thousands of Americans have flooded the streets with anti-lockdown protests as President Donald Trump voiced his support to 'liberate' states on Twitter.  Protests have appeared in several states like Oklahoma, Texas, Idaho, Virginia, Michigan, Florida, California, Kentucky, Ohio, North Carolina and Minnesota.  A few hundred demonstrators cheered and waved signs outside the New Hampshire State House on Saturday during a call to reopen the state, the Associated Press reported.  Members of the crowd carried signs with slogans such as 'Live Free or Die,' the state's motto. Others included 'Restore Jobs' and 'Kiss My Constitution.'  One demonstrator, talk show host Ian Freeman, said the government was guilty of fear-mongering over the state of the virus, and it was time to restore individual rights.  Pictured: Members of the Boogaloo Movement, attend a demonstration against the lockdown over concern about COVID-19 at the State House  'Even if the virus were 10 times as dangerous as it is, I still wouldn't stay inside my home. I'd rather take the risk and be a free person,' he said.  New Hampshire has had nearly 1,300 cases of the virus and more than three dozens deaths through Friday.  'ReOpen Maryland', an anti-lockdown group, protested the state orders Saturday in downtown Annapolis with a procession of vehicles.  The Capital Gazette reported that most protestors remained in their cars - as to keep with social distancing guidelines - and held signs out the window.  The group demanded in an online petition that Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan should re-open businesses, religious facilities and schools.  State Republican delegates pushed back at Hogan's mandates in a letter Saturday where they asked he relaxed restrictions in certain regions.  'We fundamentally believe that what works in one region of the state may not be applicable to others,” members of the House of Delegates Republican,' the letter read.  Pictured: Members of the Boogaloo Movement, attend a demonstration against the lockdown over concern about COVID-19 at the State House in Annapolis  'ReOpen Maryland', an anti-lockdown group, protested the state orders Saturday in downtown Annapolis with a procession of vehicles  The Republican officials also asked that 'local review boards' be created to watchdog county health officers' power and to end the ban on recreational activities like boating.  Spokesperson Mike Ricci responded on behalf of Hogan and said the suggestions were appreciated.  'We’re all on the same page: we want to get Maryland open again as soon as it is safe,' he said. 'We appreciate these ideas, and will continue coordinating with legislators as the governor prepares to unveil the state’s roadmap to recovery.'  The Virginia capitol building saw three anti-lockdown groups join forces on Thursday morning to hit back at lockdown orders. Gov. Ralph Northam closed nonessential businesses until May 8.  Protester Marco Caceres told NBC 12: 'Who is he to determine what is essential in our society and what is not? I believe the liquor stores are open. Is that essential? There are a lot of things that are open that many people don’t consider essential.  Pictured: A demonstrator holds a sign at the Virginia State Capitol on Thursday while protesting the coronavirus lockdown  Marco Caceres: 'You’re trying to supposedly cure a problem but you’re doing more damage in my opinion than you are trying to cure the problem by forcing people to stay in their homes, not be able to earn a living, you know isolation kills, too'  Three anti-lockdown groups in Virginia banded together to protest the state's stay-at-home orders on Friday  Like other state protestors, the Virginians forwent face masks and gloves during the rally.  'The reason why I’m not wearing a mask is that I’m not going to have someone tell me I have to,' said protester Benjamin Wright.  'It seems ridiculous to me that a lot of businesses are closed. A lot of my friends who own their businesses are in risk of going out of business over this.'  Pictured: Demonstrators, using simulated body bags for props, protest President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic in Chicago, Illinois  Anti-Trump activists rallied in front of Trump properties across the country with body bags meant to represent the lives lost due to Trump's outbreak response.  A group of protestors gathered in Chicago, Illinois, on Saturday with at least seven makeshift body bags.  Further west, activists with Refuse Fascism also put fake body bags in front of Trump International Hotel & Tower New York to protest Trump.  Some signs placed atop the body bags read 'This represents 1000+ health care workers who died of COVID-19' and 'This represents immigrants who died in ICE custody.'  One body bag used in the Chicago anti-Trump protest had a sign that read 'humanity first!

'You could get the same result out of doing a little bit less,' Trump said of the stay at home orders in those three states. 'You know, they've been treated a little bit rough,' he said of those protesting against the lockdowns, who were often photographed wearing pro-Trump paraphernalia.  Trump admitted that he singled out Virginia because the state's governor, Democrat Ralph Northam, had signed a new gun control law.

The ugly talk has grown loud enough, and common enough, that on the same night this week, April 28, three different local government bodies — the county board of supervisors and the city councils in Irvine and Garden Grove — felt the need to pass three independent resolutions denouncing hate crimes against Asian Americans.  “The Asian community was really becoming the target (for) something they effectively have no control over,” said Irvine Councilwoman Farrah Khan, explaining why she introduced the resolution in her city.  The virus originated in China. But medical experts point out that expressing anger at Chinese and other Asian Americans for this biological fact not only does nothing to address the pandemic, it actually adds to the health risk for those who are targeted.  “Racism can make people sick,” said Gilbert Gee, a public health professor at UCLA. “As in, literally, sick.”   Hate rises  By every measure — culturally, politically, numerically — Asian Americans are central to the fabric of Orange County.  Census data from 2018 shows about 21% of the county’s 3.1 million residents identify as Asian, giving Orange County one of the biggest Asian American populations in the nation.  Asian American politicians hold many city and state offices in the county, and a majority on the county board of supervisors. The county’s Little Saigon district is home to one of the biggest Vietnamese populations outside Vietnam. And recent arrivals from China, South Korea and India, among other countries, make up fast-growing sectors of many Orange County cities.  But as the coronavirus pandemic drags on, people are looking for scapegoats, said Alison Edwards, CEO of OC Human Relations, which tracks hate crimes in the county. And in the wake of President Donald Trump initially calling COVID-19 the “Chinese virus” — and the administration’s more recent focus on the role that China’s government had in spreading the disease — Asian Americans have become that target, said Patty Yoo, co-chair of Asian Americans in Action.  Yoo’s group drafted the letter that helped prompt county supervisors to officially denounce discrimination against the local Asian community.  Though the District Attorney’s office has yet to prosecute an anti-Asian hate crime related to COVID-19, OC Human Relations says such episodes are on the rise.  In recent weeks, the organization has reported 10 COVID-related hate incidents, including the distribution of racist fliers and yelling racial epithets, and one hate crime, targeting Asian Americans.  Others are seeing a similar trend.  Stop AAPI Hate, a website that tracks coronavirus-related discrimination, reported 34 incidents of prejudice against Orange County’s Asian Americans between March 19 and April 15. Most of those reports came from women, said Manjusha P. Kulkarni, the executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council which co-founded the website.  Some incidents of discrimination have been more visible than others.  In March, a video of two girls at Garden Grove’s Bolsa Grande High screaming “coronavirus” at Asian American students, drew local and national news attention. Later, a flier was left on a Huntington Beach family’s front door and car that read “You guys are Chinese Viruses” and “Get out of our country.”  But discrimination doesn’t have to be overt to be hurtful.  Supervisor Andrew Do, a Vietnamese American, recalled attending a concert in south county before the state issued a stay-at-home order.  “The stares that I got, and the icy reception I got, was palpable,” Do said during the April 28 board meeting. “It’s been many decades since I felt that level of unfriendliness.”  “Why should that just because of the color of my skin, I’m perceived as a threat?”   What’s the effect?  Speaking on Monday, April 27 town hall held by Rep. Gil Cisneros (D-Yorba Linda), Asian American residents who experienced discrimination said their experience made them more afraid to venture out for groceries and essential businesses.  “I’m making sure I carry my pepper spray wherever I go,” a Brea resident said at the town hall.  Edwards said even a single incident of discrimination can create a ripple effect felt by the broader community.  “If one member of the community feels attacked, every member will feel it,” she said. “They will be in a position of wondering, ‘Am I next?’”  And, UCLA’s Gee noted, discrimination can take a physical toll. Research has linked discrimination to health problems such as respiratory issues among Filipinos and cardiovascular conditions for Vietnamese and Chinese. And the stress brought on by being targeted, Gee added, can weaken an individual’s immune system and potentially make them more susceptible to COVID-19.   What can people do?  With so many incidents going unreported, officials don’t know the full extent of xenophobia against Asian Americans in Orange County, Edwards said. For now, Edwards and community leaders are urging people to report any incidents of discrimination, whether to nonprofits like OC Human Relations, or local law enforcement or government agencies.  “If we don’t make the public aware that this is happening, it’s so much harder to combat hate and get leaders to engage in this fight,” Edwards said.  “If constituents aren’t bringing it up, there’s no good way to fight back.”  OC Human Relations, she added, will provide resources and support for those reporting the incidents, regardless of whether they can be prosecuted.  In a Facebook post on April 1, District Attorney Todd Spitzer said his office is “more prepared than ever” to seek justice for victims of illegal discrimination.  “Hate crimes will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” Spitzer said. “There is no justification for attacking, mocking, teasing or discriminating against someone because of who they are.”  Kulkarni, of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, said it’s time for people targeted by hate — and those who witness it — to speak out.  “We don’t need bystanders,” she said. “That has come and gone.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 16, "positive": 21, "negative": 4, "disgust": 3, "joy": 6, "anger": 27, "surprise": 2, "fear": 7, "trust": 14}, "metadata": ["americans", "virus", "chinese", "professor", "populations", "district", "korea", "coronavirus", "pandemic", "ceo", "donald", "trump", "initially", "spreading", "officially", "discrimination", "targeting", "linked", "respiratory", "susceptible", "reporting", "facebook", "victims"]}, {"text": "( Photo by sergio souza from Pexels )  Growing up in a country like America where we get to vote and influence the government, it's difficult to imagine what it would feel like to live under an absolute monarchy. Or a tyrannical dictatorship. Or an oppressive, all-controlling regime. Yet the early followers of Jesus not only lived in such environments, but they flourished and grew. What can we learn from these early believers? What would they each us today?  First, they would teach us that no matter who leads the nation, no one can stop the gospel. And no matter what form of government we have, the church can grow and thrive.  I do imagine that these Christians would be amazed at the liberties we enjoy. (Obviously, they would be amazed by a lot of other things too.) They would likely tell us to do our best to guard these liberties.  But they would remind us to put our trust in God not in government and not to confuse patriotism with the kingdom of God.  Second, they would encourage us not to get caught up in partisan politics, a concept that would have been largely unknown to them.  You see, in the Roman Empire, there were not rival political parties, with your vote making a difference between which candidate would come into power. You did not have Democrat vs. Republican (or the equivalent). And while there were different social and philosophical factions, there was not a political divide. For the most part, the emperor was supreme.  For the early Christian, then, the divisions were more basic. There was light and darkness. There was the church and the world. There was the kingdom of God and the kingdom of Satan. There was heaven and hell. And there were saved people and lost people.  That is how these early believers saw their world, and that is how they saw their mission. Put another way, although they brought about powerful cultural change through the gospel, their focus was not on reforming the Roman Empire. Their focus was the Great Commission.  They still had to deal with the distractions of the flesh and the world, just as we do today. But partisan politics did not vie for their attention. Or consume their emotions. Or divide them as believers.  That's why I say that they would encourage us not to get caught up in partisan politics.  Again, they might well encourage us to exploit our democratic liberties to the full and even to run for office, if some of us were called to do so. But I believe they would help us to step above the political frenzy that so dominates and divides our nation.  Third, they would remind us that the church is not a building, especially at a time like this when our church buildings are shut during the COVID-19 crisis.  In my just-released book When the World Stops, I have an entire chapter devoted to this subject, titled, \"What Is Church and How Do We Do It?\" And I am convinced that this is one of the major lessons we must learn during this forced lockdown: The church is not a building, and Christianity is not a spectator sport.  I would think that these first believers would be stunned to see our large church buildings and cathedrals. But it would not be because they had never seen magnificent buildings. To the contrary, those who were alive to see the second temple (which was destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70) would have seen something far more spectacular than our largest megachurch facility. And the Romans themselves knew how to build.  It's just that the believers met in homes back then. There was no such thing as a church building. Consequently, a greater emphasis was put on being the church more than on going to church (although they certainly emphasized the importance of meeting together).  In this context, they would remind us that the preacher is not a performer. And the body is not an audience. And, to say it again, Christianity is not a spectator sport.  This doesn't mean they wouldn't welcome church meetings of all sizes and buildings of all sizes. It's just that their emphasis would be put on every member of the body being connected and activated. It would be on the priesthood of every believer.  Fourth, these early Christians would remind us of the need to rely on the power of the Spirit. While they would rejoice in the many ways the gospel can spread today, ways that would have been unimaginable to them, they would encourage us not to lean on technology. Or human personality. Or worldly techniques.  Instead they would urge us to remember the words of Jesus, who said, \"But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. And you shall be My witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth\" (Acts 1:8)  It is by the power of the Spirit that they rocked their world. It is by the power of the Spirit that we can rock ours.  What other lessons do you think these first believers could teach us today?

The Karnataka Epidemic Diseases, COVID-19 Regulations 2020 has put in place necessary guidelines, powers of concerned officials and even penalties for those who violate the temporary provisions, that will be valid for one year.  The need for formalising regulations comes amid the intensifying situation of COVID-19 that has gripped the state, nation and global community in a state of fear of the possibility of turning into a full blown pandemic.  “All hospitals (government or private) during screening of such cases shall record the history of travel of the person if he/she has travelled to any country or areas where COVID-19 has been reported in addition to the history of coming in contact with a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 shall be recorded,\" the regulations said.  It adds that any person, institution or organisation that uses print or electronic media  for mis-information regarding COVID-19. “In case any person/institution/organisation is found indulging in such activity, it will be treated as a punishable offence under these regulations,\" according to the new regulations.  It says that anyone found in violation of the provisions of the regulations “shall be deemed to have committed an offence\" under section 188 of the IPC (Indian Penal Code).  Incidentally, some news organisations published that Karnataka had declared COVID-19 as a state epidemic on Wednesday evening.  \"There is news circulating on social media which says (that the) Karnataka government has declared COVID19 as a state epidemic & orders closure of schools, offices. I would like to say that this is completely fake news,\" Pankaj Kumar Pandey, commissioner for health, family welfare and Ayush services, Karnataka said in a recorded statement on Wednesday.  The regulations include directives to private hospitals to document patient and travel details of the person if he/she has travelled to any country or areas where COVID-19 has been reported in addition to the history of coming in contact with a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 shall be recorded.  The regulations also says that any person who has a travel history to COVID-19 must disclose this information to the nearest government hospital or call authorities. It adds that concerned authorities can forcefully admit and isolate unwilling patients for a period of 14 days from the onset of symptoms or till reports or lab tests are received. The regulations adds that no private laboratory has been authorised to take test samples for COVID-19 in Karnataka.  The regulations also accord powers to relevant authorities to seal geographical areas,  barring entry and exit of population from the containment area, closure of schools and office, and banning public gatherings if there COVID-19 is from a defined geographic area such as village, town, city, ward, colony or settlement. The regulations add that “the district administration of the concerned district shall have the right to implement the following containment measures but not limited to these, in order to prevent spread of the disease.\"  Subscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.

The state government has also asked the farmers to get registered by April 19. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, on Tuesday, said that the entire harvested lot of wheat and mustard crops will be purchased by the state government. It has also asked the central government to approve an incentive for the farmers as holding charges for the delay in the procurement.  The government also said that it will start the procurement of mustard from April 15 and wheat from April 20. The farmers can register themselves on an online portal called “Meri Fasal-Mera Byora” from till April 19.  Khattar, who was addressing a video conference, also asked the farmers to make voluntary contributions of 1-5% of the money they make after selling the produce towards the CM relief fund. “Instead of centralised procurement, the government has decided to set up smaller mandis and purchasing centres at different places where farmers can come at an appointed day and time to sell their produce. I request all farmers to get registered with the government by April 19, which will ease the process of procurement,” he said.  Referring to the voluntary contributions, the CM said that if farmers are willing, they can make a contribution at the mandi itself. “They will be asked for a contribution and if they give a nod, the payment will be deducted,” he said, adding that the arhatis (commission agents) will also have to play a crucial role in ensuring smooth procurement and loading and unloading of the produce at newly set-up mandis.  The CM also said that, in line with the decision of the Centre of diverting the MPLADS (member of Parliament local area development scheme) funds for fighting the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, the Haryana government has decided to divert ₹51 crore from the discretionary funds of the CM, ministers, Speaker and the governor to the Consolidated Fund. “This money will be used to provide food, medicine, and other essential required by the distressed workers. Since the lockdown, the government has distributed 55 lakh food packets and 3.5 lakh dry ration packets to those in need,” said Khattar.  Residents of the state, who hold BPL and other cards will be given double the entitled ration and that too free of cost for the next three months. “Those who are above the poverty line can also buy flour, rice and oil from ration shops at discounted prices,” he said.

The operation was reported to Greeley police by a woman who said she was stopped around 4:50 a.m. Friday on the Highway 34 business route, between Loveland and Greeley.  She said people wearing yellow vests directed cars into an area marked with traffic cones. Three or four silver cars were parked nearby, some with red and blue flashing lights on their dashboards, Greeley police Cmdr. Rafael Gutierrez said Sunday.  The woman was questioned by a man in a dark uniform who was wearing a gas mask and had a baton and pepper spray on his belt. The woman saw no badges or logos on the people or their cars.  “The individual asked to see her license, insurance and registration, and demanded explanation as to why she was violating COVID-19 law,” Gutierrez said. “He told the woman she could get charged with a violation for being out. And apparently he showed her something she thought looked like a ticket but it was never given to her.”  After about 10 minutes, the man let the woman leave, Gutierrez said. The woman told police she was the first of about half a dozen cars that she saw directed into the roadblock.  Greeley police did not conduct the roadblock, and they found no other agencies conducting such an operation at that time. Additionally, no law enforcement officer checked the woman’s name or license plate through official channels, Gutierrez said.  “We are actively pursuing an investigation on this and hopefully we can figure out who they are and get an explanation for their actions, and if they are doing it for criminal reasons then we can pursue the appropriate charges against them,” he said.  Gutierrez said he’d heard of one similar incident in the past week in the Fort Collins/Greeley area, and another was reported in the Denver suburb of Aurora.  In the Aurora incident, on Wednesday, a woman was pulled over late at night by a man in a dark Ford Crown Victoria with red and blue lights. The man, wearing a dark blue uniform without a badge, questioned her about why she was out during the stay-home order.  In another unsanctioned enforcement action, in Maine, neighbors reportedly felled a tree and used it to block the driveway of a home where they believed coronavirus patients were living.  Colorado’s stay-at-home order allows residents to make trips that are essential for daily life, like grocery shopping, caring for sick relatives or going to the pharmacy. Those who work at businesses deemed essential are also allowed to be out and about.  Law enforcement agencies across the state have said they will issue multiple warnings to residents who violate the order before issuing any citations, and some, like Denver police, have said they do not intend to stop vehicles to check for compliance.

As provinces begin opening up their economies from COVID-19 lockdowns, Trudeau said none of those recovery plans hinge on people being immune to catching COVID-19 twice.  Trudeau said he spoke to premiers Friday and they discussed a basic framework that provinces will use as they reopen businesses, schools and other institutions. The focus, he said, is on preventing the spread of the virus through physical distancing and personal protective equipment.  \"It is very clear that the science is not decided on whether or not having had COVID once prevents you from having it again,\" he told reporters. \"It's something we need to get clearer answers to and until we get those clearer answers, we need to err on the side of more caution.\"  Trudeau was responding to a recent World Health Organization brief stating there is no evidence that people who have recovered from the virus have antibodies that protect them from getting infected again.  The WHO issued the brief after some countries announced the possibility of providing so-called \"immunity passports\" or \"risk-free certificates\" to citizens who have already been infected.  But on Saturday, the international body walked that back some.  \"We expect that most people who are infected with COVID-19 will develop an antibody response that will provide some level of protection,\" the organization wrote on Twitter. \"What we don't yet know is the level of protection or how long it will last.\"  The WHO said scientists around the world are working to answer that key question.  In Canada, the provinces have varying approaches to relaxing public health orders that were put in place to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus.  Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia, for instance, continue to urge citizens to stay home as much as possible, while New Brunswick announced Friday low-risk outdoor activities such as golf, hunting and fishing were permitted to resume.  Ontario and Quebec announced they would present their recovery plans in the coming week, with Quebec Premier Francois Legault saying his government would detail separate plans for schools and then for businesses.  Legault and the province's director of public health, Dr. Horacio Arruda, have been pushing the idea of \"herd immunity\" as an approach to re-opening schools. That strategy involves exposing a large proportion of Quebecers to the novel coronavirus in a measured, gradual way, to help them develop a natural immunity.  That theory follows the logic of a vaccination program. When people receive a vaccine, they are given a weakened form of the virus, allowing their immune system to build antibodies to kill it.  \"The idea is to go very gradually so that people who are less at risk can develop antibodies to be able to become immune,'' Legault told reporters earlier in the week.  But Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, warned against that approach Saturday. She said the federal government has put in place an immunity task force that will investigate how people's immune systems are responding to COVID-19.  She said that since many Canadians have followed physical distancing orders, the percentage of the immunized population is \"quite low.\" And despite evidence that the virus is particularly dangerous to older people and those with underlying health conditions, younger people are still at risk.  \"So the idea of generating natural immunity is actually not something that I think should be undertaken,\" she said. \"I personally think that as medical officers, we would be extremely cautious about that kind of approach.\"  The case count in Canada topped 45,000 on Saturday. The global death toll, meanwhile, climbed above 200,000.  Many of the deaths in Canada have been people in seniors' homes and long-term care facilities, which have struggled to manage outbreaks among residents and staff.  Five of the six deaths connected to COVID-19 that were reported Saturday in Nova Scotia, for example, occurred at the Northwood long-term care home in Halifax Regional Municipality. There are 10 licensed long-term care homes and unlicensed seniors' facilities in Nova Scotia with cases of COVID-19, involving 191 residents and 90 staff.  The situation is far worse in Quebec, where 65 per cent of the province's 1,446 COVID deaths have occurred at long-term care facilities, many of which are severely understaffed. Another 15 per cent of the province's death total comes from senior homes.  In Ontario, frontline workers in facilities such as long-term care homes, will receive a raise of $4 per hour for the next four months, Premier Doug Ford announced Saturday.  Aside from the long-term care homes, the premier said the bonus will be available for workers in seniors' residences, emergency shelters, supportive housing, social services congregate care settings, corrections institutions and youth justice facilities, home and community care providers and some staff in hospitals.  The premier made the announcement as dozens of protesters took to the provincial legislature to defy physical distancing measures set by the province.  \"It just burns me up,\" said Ford, who called the protesters \"reckless\" and \"selfish.\"  \"We have health-care people working tirelessly, but then we have a bunch of yahoos sitting there protesting as they're breaking the law and putting workers in jeopardy.\"  This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 25, 2020.

As the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread in the United States, many restaurants and fast food locations have closed dining rooms, and are only offering takeout or delivery options.  Meanwhile, those establishments that remain open have reportedly increased cleaning and sanitizing protocols.  CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE  The increased efforts to keep all high-touch areas cleaned and to avoid, in many cases, hand-to-hand contact, beg the question of whether it is safe to order delivery and takeout food.  While the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have said there is no evidence to suggest the virus can be spread through food or food packaging, COVID-19 is believed to be able to survive on plastic or hard surfaces up to three days, or for up to 24 hours on cardboard.

Opt to not receive utensils in the delivery bag, and instead use your own clean forks and knives at home. Also, wash your hands with soap and water before and after handling the food — and avoid touching your face, nose and mouth with your hands.  As the virus is mostly spread by person-to-person contact, aim to limit potential exposure by opting for no-contact delivery.

At the same time, our FBI has shut down its FOIA operations, because of the coronavirus.  Here's the latest. We have released a joint status report in a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit for records about top Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and his wife Nellie Ohr, in which the DOJ states it has suspended electronic FOIA operations. The Ohrs were involved in the anti-Trump dossier authored by former British spy Christopher Steele.  The Justice Department claims it is currently unable to continue searching for documents because the employees who would conduct the search in the FBI Records/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) are, \"non-mission critical\" during the COVID-19 pandemic and were ordered to stay at home beginning March 17.  Included in the joint status report is a declaration from Michael G. Seidel, the FBI's Assistant Section Chief of RIDS, Information Management Division, in which he states:  RIDS employees have been designated as not mission-critical and sent home as of March 17, 2020. Only a limited number of managers are being permitted to report to the office, but no FOIA processing is occurring as of March 17, 2020. While RIDS currently anticipates that its staff will return to work on March 30, 2020, this situation remains fluid and will be regularly re-assessed as circumstances change. As of March 17,2020, no further production of records pursuant to FOIA will be made, whether those productions are in relation to requests in litigation or at the administrative stage.  The filing comes in a March 2018 Freedom of Information Act lawsuit we brought after Justice failed to respond a December 2017 request (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:18-cv-00490)) for:  All records of contact or communication, including but not limited to emails, text messages, and instant chats between Bruce Ohr and any of the following individuals/entities: former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele; owner of Fusion GPS Glenn Simpson; and any other employees or representatives of Fusion GPS.  All travel requests, authorizations and expense reports for Bruce Ohr.  All calendar entries for Bruce Ohr.  So those responsible for Spygate get a breather while the people's right to transparency is put on hold. When it came to spying on President Trump and innocent Americans, the FBI spared no expense, but coming up with a plan to fulfill their legal obligation to transparency can apparently be put off indefinitely.  Judicial Watch and the DOJ have agreed to provide another joint status report to the court on April 8.  We previously uncovered that Ohr was used by the FBI as a conduit for the Clinton-funded dossier by the Clinton-DNC spy ring at Fusion GPS. His wife Nellie, who was employed by Fusion GPS, passed dossier information to the FBI through him and later deleted emails received from him.  In April 2019, we uncovered documents showing that Bruce Ohr knew he had \"possible ethics concerns,\" in his January 2018 preparation to testify to the Senate and House intelligence committees. He emailed his attorney and forwarded that information to his wife.  Bruce Ohr testified to Congress that he received Clinton-dossier information from his wife Nellie, who provided him with a memory stick that he then circulated to the FBI.  In May 2019, we uncovered that Nellie Ohr told Bruce that she deleted emails received from his DOJ account.  In June 2019, we uncovered that Bruce Ohr received a total of $42,520 in performance bonuses during the Trump/Russia investigation. Ohr's bonus nearly doubled from $14,520 (received in November 2015) to $28,000 in November 2016.  On August 9, 2019 we obtained Bruce Ohr's FBI 302 interview reports showing that he was one of the main conduits used by Fusion GPS to spread the false information they created to smear President Trump.  On August 14, 2019, we uncovered even more evidence that Nellie Ohr sent Clinton-funded dossier materials to the DOJ through her husband Bruce.

Vice President Mike Pence stated that the government was committed to answering requests from governors for additional capacity by “creating field hospitals” or “retrofitting existing buildings,” with support from the Army Corps of Engineers.  In addition to constructing field hospitals and expanding existing hospital capacity, the US government should identify potential surplus federal real property for immediate conversion to increase hospital bed capacity and to fulfill other needs, such as extensive quarantines or isolation needs related to COVID-19. The federal government has thousands of surplus facilities, including hospital buildings and dormitories, that are eligible to be repurposed for public health needs under current federal law.  According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the United States has 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 persons, as of 2016. Other developed nations have significantly more capacity. Germany, for example, has 8 beds per 1,000 persons. Multiple analyses suggest that the United States will need to significantly increase hospital bed capacity during the pandemic. An analysis published by Health Affairs found that demand for intensive care units could reach between 250 percent and 500 percent of current available capacity, depending on the severity of the pandemic and whether demand is focused within 6 or 12 months. Johns Hopkins University recently estimated that there are fewer than 100,000 ICU beds in the United States and projected that 200,000 to 2.9 million people may require such care.  The United States may also need additional quarantine and isolation facilities. According to the Cleveland Clinic, “Quarantines are for people or groups who don’t have symptoms but were exposed to the sickness.” Isolation is for people who already have contracted the disease. Quarantine and isolation are necessary precautions to prevent the spread of disease during a pandemic.  Federal and state governments have legal authority to quarantine people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention maintains 20 quarantine stations across the United States. Information about the national capacity for quarantine and isolation is limited. But presumably the nation’s current capacity is well below what could be needed to address the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, state and local communities may need to assist certain populations who may be unable to self-quarantine or self-isolate at home, such as homeless individuals, or those who need to be transferred to a safer facility, such as older individuals or others living in residential care facilities where outbreaks occur.  The Opportunity to Use Surplus Federal Real Property to Increase Public Health Capacity  The federal government has many properties and facilities that are currently underutilized. Since 2003, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) has identified federal real property management as a “high-risk area.” GAO reports that federal agencies could achieve significant savings by disposing of surplus properties that they own or lease. As of 2015, GAO reported that federal agencies had 7,000 surplus facilities. Moreover, GAO warned that agencies struggle to keep track of their properties, which means that the number of surplus properties may be even larger.  Since 2016, Congress and the White House have directed agencies to streamline real property assets and dispose of unnecessary surplus properties. But it is likely that many surplus federal real properties remain underused and could be repurposed to assist with the COVID-19 pandemic response.  This month, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued an “Addendum to the National Strategy for the Efficient Use of Real Property,” which described the administration’s vision and goals for real property management. The memorandum also identified issues that pose challenges to effective management of real property, including the disposal process. OMB wrote,  \"The current process under Title 40 of the U.S. Code for disposing of unneeded Federal real property is burdensome and it does not provide incentives for Federal managers to dispose of property or to maximize the disposal value to taxpayers.\"  Further, OMB explained that federal law requires agencies to screen “12 discrete public benefit conveyance requirements prior to sale.” As the General Services Administration (GSA) explains, “Various statutes authorize conveyance to state and local governments and in some cases to nonprofits at up to 100% discount for public benefit use.”  Promoting public health is one of these public benefits. Under Title 40 rules for federal real property disposal, GSA and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have broad authority to transfer, sell, or lease properties for the purpose of promoting public health:  The Administrator, in the Administrator’s discretion and under regulations that the Administrator may prescribe, may assign to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for disposal surplus real property, including buildings, fixtures, and equipment situated on the property, that the Secretary recommends as needed for use in the protection of public health, including research.  Title 40 also states that the HHS secretary can sell or transfer these properties to states or medical institutions:  The Secretary, for use in the protection of public health, including research, may sell or lease property assigned to the Secretary under paragraph (1) to a state, a political subdivision or instrumentality of a state, a tax-supported medical institution, or a hospital or similar institution not operated for profit that has been held exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) [of the Internal Revenue Code].  Publicly available information about surplus federal properties currently available for disposal is limited. However, according to GSA, federal agencies reported that 34 hospital buildings, 140 dormitories/barrack buildings, and 827 family housing units were “unutilized” as of FY 2018. That year, federal agencies also reported that 7 hospital buildings, 120 dormitories/barracks buildings, and 328 family housing units were “underutilized” at the time.  Recommendations for National and State Policymakers and the Private Sector  Congress, the administration, state and local governments, and private-sector partners should quickly review currently available surplus federal real properties and identify opportunities to use those surplus and underutilized properties to expand hospital and quarantine capacity as needed to respond to the national emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The following are specific recommended actions:  OMB should review and, if necessary, update rules regarding the disposal or transfer of surplus federal real property to expedite the transfer to state governments, local governments, and medical institutions for the purpose of promoting public health. Further, OMB should direct agencies to cooperate with GSA to expedite the disposal of surplus properties for public health purposes. In addition, OMB should direct agencies to immediately transfer to GSA properties that are currently underutilized but not currently on the GSA list of properties eligible for disposal.  GSA should immediately review surplus real property and identify properties that should be repurposed for healthcare and quarantine facilities. GSA should create and make public a list of properties and present recommendations to the White House and the HHS secretary for their transfer to promote public health.  HHS should establish an initiative to expedite the transfer, sale, or lease of properties to state governments, local governments, or medical institutions. Recognizing that states, local governments, and medical institutions are on the front lines of the public health response to the pandemic, HHS should identify ways to streamline the public benefit conveyance transfer process for properties that can promote public health.  States, local governments, and medical institutions should review GSA’s available federal and state government surplus real property and request facilities that could be used to support healthcare and quarantine capacity, particularly to help increase capacity in underserved communities. In addition, states should review and identify potential surplus state- or local-government-owned properties that could similarly be repurposed.   Conclusion  Transferring surplus federal real property to states, local governments, and medical institutions would be a cost-effective way to begin to expand hospital and quarantine capacity at the state and local level. To be sure, transferring properties by itself will not solve immediate capacity problems. Transferred properties will require work for conversion to medical or quarantine use, new resources and infrastructure, and, most importantly, personnel to provide healthcare and quarantine or isolation services. Nevertheless, unused government facilities are valuable resources that could be used to promote US public health capacity and help address the COVID-19 pandemic.

In Florida, people are returning to a few beaches and parks. And protesters are clamoring for more.Governors eager to rescue their economies and feeling heat from President Donald Trump are moving to ease restrictions meant to control the spread of the coronavirus, even as new hot spots emerge and experts warn that moving too fast could prove disastrous.Adding to the pressure are protests against stay-at-home orders organized by small-government groups and Trump supporters. They staged demonstrations Saturday in several cities after the president urged them to \"liberate\" three states led by Democratic governors.Protests happened in Republican-led states, too, including at the Texas Capitol and in front of the Indiana governor's home. Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott already said that restrictions will begin easing next week. Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb - who signed an agreement with six other Midwestern states to coordinate reopening - said he would extend his stay-at-home order until May 1.For the first time in weeks, people were able to visit some Florida beaches, but they were still subject to restrictions on hours and activities. Beaches in big cities stayed closed.Meanwhile, infections kept surging in the Northeast.Rhode Island, between the hot spots of Massachusetts and New York, has seen a steady daily increase in infections and deaths, with nursing home residents accounting for more than 90 of the state's 118 deaths. The state's death rate of around 10 people per 100,000 is among the nation's highest per capita, according to data compiled by the COVID Tracking Project.Massachusetts had its highest number of deaths in a single day on Friday, with 159. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, citing the advice of health experts, said states should wait until infection rates and hospitalizations decline for about two weeks before acting.Trump, whose administration waited months to bolster stockpiles of key medical supplies and equipment, appeared to back protesters.\"LIBERATE MINNESOTA!\" \"LIBERATE MICHIGAN!\" \"LIBERATE VIRGINIA, \" Trump said in a tweet-storm in which he also lashed out at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, for criticizing the federal response. Cuomo \"should spend more time 'doing' and less time 'complaining,'\" the president said.At his Saturday briefing with reporters, Cuomo cited more progress. The daily increase in deaths in New York state fell below 550 for the first time in more than two weeks as hospitalizations continued to decline.But the crisis is far from over: Hospitals are still reporting nearly 2,000 new COVID-19 patients per day, and nursing homes remain a \"feeding frenzy for this virus,\" he said.\"We are not at a point when we are going to be reopening anything immediately,\" Cuomo said.In Texas, several hundred people rallied on steps of the state Capitol to call for an end to social restrictions. Many protesters sought an immediate lifting of restrictions and chanted \"Let us work!\" in a state where more than 1 million people have filed for unemployment since the crisis began.The rally was organized by a host of Infowars, owned by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who joined protesters on the Capitol steps. Jones is being sued in Austin over using his show to promote falsehoods that the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre in Connecticut was a hoax.More than 200 people stood close together outside the governor's mansion in Indianapolis, carrying American flags and signs demanding that Holcomb lift restrictions. The state health department reported 529 new coronavirus cases between April 7 and midday Friday, raising the total to more than 10,600. The number of deaths rose by 26, to 545.Elsewhere, a few hundred demonstrators cheered and waved signs outside the Statehouse in New Hampshire, which has had nearly 1,300 cases of the virus and more than three dozen deaths through Friday.\"Even if the virus were 10 times as dangerous as it is, I still wouldn't stay inside my home. I'd rather take the risk and be a free person,\" said one of the protesters, talk show host Ian Freeman.Trump is pushing to relax the U.S. lockdown by May 1, a plan that hinges partly on more testing.Public health officials said the ability to test enough people and trace contacts of those who are infected is crucial before easing restrictions, and that infections could surge anew unless people continue to take precautions.In Asia, some nations that until recently appeared to have the outbreak under control reported a fresh increase in cases Saturday.Japan's total case number rose above 10,000. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said he's concerned that people are not observing social distancing and announced a 100,000-yen ($930) cash handout to each resident as an incentive to stay home.Singapore reported a sharp, one-day spike of 942 infections, the highest in Southeast Asia, mostly among foreign workers staying in crowded dormitories. That brought the total to almost 6,000 in the tiny city-state of 6 million.There have been tentative signs that measures to curb the outbreak are working, with the rate of new infections slowing across Europe.France and Spain started dismantling some field hospitals, while the number of active cases in Germany has slowly declined over the past week as people recover.France's national health agency said Saturday that the number of virus patients in intensive care dropped for the 10th day straight, and overall virus hospitalizations have fallen for three consecutive days. The country has seen almost 20,000 virus deaths.The agency urged the French public to stick to the country's strict confinement measures, which have been extended until at least May 11: \"Together, we will vanquish the pandemic. Don't relax our efforts at the moment when confinement is bearing fruit.\"In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the government will seek to extend the state of emergency to May 9 but begin easing the total confinement of children beginning April 27.Children are thought to be a major source of transmission even if they rarely fall ill from the virus. But they've been confined to their homes for five weeks, prompting parents to ask that they be allowed to at least take a daily walk.Sánchez announced in a televised news conference late Saturday that the government would allow children \"to get out of their houses for a period on a daily basis,\" but the specifics needed to be ironed out with experts.The national lockdown would be rolled back only when the country's embattled health system is ready for a possible rebound of infections, he said.The virus is believed to have infected more than 2.3 million people worldwide. While most recover, the outbreak has killed at least 155,000 people worldwide, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally based on figures supplied by government health authorities around the globe.The number almost certainly underestimates the actual toll. Nearly everywhere, thousands have died with COVID-19 symptoms - many in nursing homes - without being tested for the virus, and have thus gone uncounted.

French MPs who put their names on letter drew their inspiration from a move made late last month by the leftist Portuguese government which effectively gave amnesty to illegal immigrants.  Voice of Europe reported, that Portugal’s leftist government granted full citizenship rights to all asylum seekers and illegal migrants, giving them access to the country’s national health service, welfare benefits, social security system during the pandemic. The move was allegedly taken to “reduce the risks for public health” and will only last until the COVID-19 pandemic is over, according to government officials.  In their letter, however, the French lawmakers failed to mention whether the amnesty they’re calling for would be temporary.  “We solemnly call on the French government to take the same measures as the Portuguese government. The health catastrophe we are experiencing forces us to act responsibly and without delay, as our Portuguese friends have done,” the letter which was published by Le Journal du Dimache states.  Signatories of the letter argue that providing amnesty to illegal immigrants would reduce the risks for public health since the migrants would have access to healthcare if they were to become infected with COVID-19.  The move comes a couple of weeks after the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights Dunja Mijatovic urged EU member states to release migrants from detention centers to prevent the spread of the Chinese COVID-19 virus.  Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom have already released migrants as a result of the pandemic.

The development came after sector experts suggested an all-hands-on-deck approach with strategic protection to older specialists. The health ministry said in a recent guideline that dentists could be roped in for the anti-Covid-19 effort too.  “There are not more than 40,000 anaesthetists, who are specifically trained to handle ventilators, practising across the country. At least half of them are above the age of 50, who we would be putting at risk in a Covid-19 ICU. Of the others, most are in the cities. When we plan for the surge in cases, we should think of an AIIMS or other hospitals in the city which are usually training centres and have resident doctors,” said Dr Devi Shetty, chairman and founder of Narayana Health group.  “The district hospitals, which would handle the bulk of the patients, have maybe 15 or at best 25 specialists and only about two anaesthetists. If these 200 to 300 bed hospitals are converted to critical care facilities, who will handle the cases? The latest national health profile shows an 85% shortage for the existing work,” said Dr Shetty.  To be sure, there were just over a million doctors registered with state medical councils in 2017, of which only 80% were estimated to be in active service, according to the government. This means, India has one doctor for every about 1,500 persons; World Health Organization (WHO) norms suggest that there must be one doctor for every 1,000 persons. In rural India, however, this ratio goes down to as low as one doctor for over 10,000 patients.  Every year, nearly 38,000 postgraduation and 70,000 MBBS students graduate from colleges in India.  “Right now, we are in the process of procuring ventilators, but not all the doctors working currently are trained to handle ventilators. So, the first step would be to train a large number of people to use ventilators. We may also look at training postgraduation and BSc nursing students,” said Dr Srinath Reddy, president of Public Health Foundation of India and a member of the national task force on Covid-19.  “Those MBBS students who are doing their final internship might be allowed to take care of less critical patients. The option of allowing foreign medical graduates awaiting certification can be explored.”  “There are no hard and fast rules. If need arises, states can explore options of identifying people and training them as per the need. They can involve students or even AYUSH practitioners for screening of patients. When there is an emergency, it is an all-hands-on-deck situation,” said a health ministry official.  Some experts have also suggest mobilising human resources from various departments within hospitals while others say various forms of medical training recognised by the Medical Council of India (MCI) could be provided.  “Many doctors, nurses and technicians have already been freed up by stopping elective procedures. If there is a surge in the number of cases, doctors from other clinical departments who don’t usually manage critical care can be roped in after a short training. Then, there are several private medical colleges that are underutilised but have good ICU facilities and the necessary staff as per MCI requirements; these can be utilised too,” said Dr MC Misra, former director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi.  In Delhi, doctors can be diverted from various hospitals to centres managing Covid-19 patients, according to Dr SK Sarin, who headed the committee guiding chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in readying a preparedness model.  “We are preparing infrastructure and manpower for a surge of up to 1,000 cases a day. Right now, we are not even getting 100 cases in a day, but in case that happens we have two hospitals ready,” he said.  MCI allowing people with various forms of training to join the Covid-19 fight will increase young manpower, said Dr Devi Shetty.  “Around 50,000 postgraduate students are training in various specialties, including some who might have failed the certification exams before. They have experience of working in hospitals and can be allowed to treat Covid-19 patients without waiting for examinations. The MCI had derecognised the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Maharashtra that has trained 40,000 specialists; we can ask them to work in district hospitals in return for recognition. There are 2,000 specialists who have been trained by the Society for Emergency Medicine and another 2,000 in cardiology by IGNOU; MCI can recognise all of them and let them work in district hospitals,” he said.

This fact might have you wondering if that weird cough or recurrent fever you had in late January or February was actually COVID-19. It's not impossible, experts say, but it's not necessarily likely, either. The virus was certainly circulating during that time. However, what is unknown is how prevalent it was, especially compared with the other respiratory viruses of winter.  \"The initial introduction of the virus in the U.S. coincided with the peak of the flu season, so the symptoms you had, it would be difficult to untangle with flu,\" said Matteo Chinazzi, an associate research scientist at Northeastern University in Boston, who is on a team that has been modeling the virus' spread around the world.  Related: Coronavirus outbreak: Live updates   COVID-19 timeline  The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was first detected by testing in the United States in January. That case occurred in a 35-year-old man who was tested on Jan. 19, four days after returning from Wuhan to his home in Snohomish County, Washington.  But it wasn't until a month later, on Feb. 26, that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the first known case of community spread of coronavirus in the United States, in a California resident who had no known contact with a traveler from China. Just a few days later, a group of researchers studying flu test samples in Washington state discovered a sample that contained the genetic sequence for that coronavirus, which causes COVID-19. It belonged to a teenager who had contracted the virus in the community.  It is now clear that the first cases of community spread in the United States weren't in late February, but instead were in January, when only travel-related cases were being caught and reported.  This is evident in a few different ways. First, the small genetic differences between the coronavirus in the Washington state teenager and in samples from Wuhan suggested that the virus had come over from Wuhan and had been circulating, and gradually mutating, over the course of about five weeks, infectious disease researcher Trevor Bedford of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center wrote in a blog post in early March.  Second, the newest death data also points to community spread of coronavirus in January. The first reported coronavirus death in the United States was thought to be a man in his 50s who died on Feb. 28 in King County, Washington. Autopsy results from two deaths in Kirkland, Washington, subsequently pushed the first known deaths in the U.S. back to Feb. 26.  On April 22, though, the CDC confirmed, based on autopsy results, that two people in Santa Clara County had died at home of COVID-19 on Feb. 6 and Feb. 17. Neither had a travel history and are thought to have caught the disease from community spread. Because COVID-19 typically has an incubation period of 5 to 6 days (and up to 14 days) between when people are infected and when they show symptoms, and because it usually takes several weeks after that for fatally ill patients to die, the early February deaths suggest that the individuals caught COVID-19 in mid- to late January.  Finally, modeling work based on travel patterns shows the virus arriving in New York in early January and in California by mid-January, Chinazzi told Live Science. Other states followed.  \"What our model seems to indicate is that the first introduction of the virus in New York was around early January and more generally, what we see is that by the end of February, most of the states have been seeded and have local transmission,\" Chinazzi said.  The first confirmed community spread of the coronavirus in New York was in a lawyer from Westchester County who first went to the hospital for his symptoms on Feb. 27, New York 4 reported. Genetic studies of viral samples in New York now suggest that community spread began by late January, mostly from introductions of the virus from Europe. Researchers at both NYU Langone and Mount Sinai conducted those studies.  Epidemiologists in Colorado believe that the coronavirus landed in the Rocky Mountains somewhere between Jan. 20 and Jan. 30. The estimate comes from two different methods, Elizabeth Carlton, an epidemiologist at the University of Colorado School of Public Health, told Live Science. First, simple back-of-the-envelope calculations based on when the first detected cases in Colorado's outbreak reported symptoms suggest that those people got sick in that time frame. Second, the models that Carlton and her colleagues are using to track and forecast Colorado's cases fit the idea that the first cases in the state emerged between Jan. 20 and Jan. 30. (Colorado didn't report its first cases of the virus until March 4, according to Colorado Public Radio.)  \"It's ski season in Colorado in January, so it's not hard to imagine that someone from one of the West Coast states came to Colorado to go skiing and brought an infection,\" Carlton said. \"That's just one of many possible routes.\"  Data on excess deaths compared to previous years can also help reveal when coronavirus landed in a particular state. In Florida, for example, The Sun-Sentinel reported that a spike in pneumonia-related deaths in mid-March could point to a nascent coronavirus outbreak starting by at least late February.   Was that cough COVID-19?  Given differences in the timing of the virus's arrival and the severity of outbreaks so far, the chance that any given respiratory illness in January or February could have been COVID-19 depends on where you live: It's far more likely that a resident of Manhattan in New York City has already had the virus compared with a resident of Manhattan, Kansas.  Flu season clouds the issue. There's no national clearinghouse of influenza case statistics, and many people with flu are not given a flu swab to confirm the diagnosis, so no one knows exactly how many cases of influenza occurred in January or February either. But the CDC estimates that there were between 39 million and 56 million cases of flu in the U.S. between October 2019 and April 2020. That means that at the peak of flu season in January and February, the number of cases of influenza virus likely far outnumbered the coronavirus cases in the United States.   Advertisement  It's also hard to extrapolate back today's infection numbers to estimate the prevalence of coronavirus in January and February. That's because many cases of COVID-19 are still going undiagnosed by testing, and researchers still don't know how many people infected with coronavirus experience only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, Carlton and Chinazzi said.  Antibody studies, which look for immune-system proteins made when the body fights off a virus, can reveal approximately how many people in a population have been exposed. A research study that recruited people at grocery stores and tested their blood for antibodies to the coronavirus found that 1 in 7 people in New York state, and nearly 1 in 4 in New York City, has been exposed to the coronavirus. It's unclear whether those results will generalize to the population at large — people staying home to avoid even grocery stories might have lower infection rates, for example — but they do suggest that the chances of someone in New York having been infected already are not negligible. However, given that the virus spreads exponentially through the population, extrapolating back to January or February shrinks the number of active cases significantly, meaning that likely only a tiny fraction of people in the city were sick with COVID-19 at that time.  That means if you had respiratory symptoms in New York in January or February, chances are probably still better that it was the flu or a seasonally circulating coronavirus.  Elsewhere, the chances of having had coronavirus in January or February are even less clear. Two controversial studies in California put the percent of people who had already been exposed at between 2.5% and 4.2% in Santa Clara county and at up to 5.6% in Los Angeles, but those data have been criticized as likely overestimating the exposure. Both may have inadvertently recruited participants who thought they might have been exposed, biasing the sample; in addition, the antibody tests they used had a high rate of false positives, making results unreliable when low levels of the population have been exposed to the disease.  In Colorado, epidemiologists are estimating that 1% of the population has already had COVID-19. A cough or fever in February would be more likely than one in January to be a symptom of COVID-19, Carlton said, simply because there would have been more circulating cases as time went on. But there's a lot of uncertainty in the 1% estimate given limitations in testing and the wide range of severity of symptoms, Carlton said.  \"This is the question that everyone is interested in answering,\" she said. \"How many people really have had it?\"  Originally published on Live Science.

However, generally speaking, the political Left in academia, can never miss the chance to smear Republicans in congress.  Unfortunately the political Left is already adopted and using a statement by distinguished microbiology / chemical biology professor Richard Ebright. Ebright called Senator Cotton’s statement “irresponsible” and stated that he had reviewed the genome of the Novel Corona Virus and found it had not been modified. While the statement had no political intent, it’s already been weaponized by the political Left. And in fact the statement about the biological weapons status of the virus is not correct. Here is some information to shed light on this question.  IS COVID-19 A MILITARY WEAPON?  There are two ways to determine this. One is if the virus is held and controlled by military which engages in biological warfare. The second is the genome of the virus and just as importantly, the behavior of the virus after it is unleashed into the population.  The virus itself was stolen from the Canadian Microbiology Laboratory in 2017 or before and sent to China. It was sent to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  The Wuhan Virology Institute has two components. One is that of the China Academy of Science, which is civilian. But it has a second division which is that of the People’s Liberation Army biological warfare corps.  Scientists and technicians from the Academic part are not allowed into the military part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology. They are separate in their activities.  Basically the virus was stolen from the Canadian Microbiology Laboratory and ended in the hands of a biological warfare military unit. This makes the statements of Ebright appear premature and dangerous.  Professor Ebright backtracked a bit and said that the virus might have been leaked accidentally from the Wuhan Institute, admitting that he understands it did not originate in the Wuhan Fish and Animal Market.  Dr Joel S Holmes is a new weekly columnist and commentator on America Out Loud. This initial essay may very well be one of the most important he will write in that his new book provides essential information for all of us.

Survival strategies… Coronavirus Pandemic 2020  A virus weaponized in China for biological warfare  Whether the virus was modified by inserting new material into the virus or not is beside the point… it is a biological weapon in any case.  A second means of determining whether a virus is a biological weapon is whether it has unusual characteristics not associated with known behavior of that type virus after it is found in the population.  The Novel Coronavirus has very very unusual behaviors. Here are just a few.  It has unheard of incubation periods and it is infectious during that time, which other such viruses in our experience are not.  The incubation period, meaning the time from infection to the time symptoms occurs are reportedly AT LEAST 14 days for the COVID-19. And now the incubation period appears to be even longer.  Health officials in Heilongjiang Province in China have established the incubation period as 21 days. Experts say the incubation period may be as many as 24 days. During that time, the infected person is spreading the disease without symptoms.  The median period of of SARS and MERS viruses is about 5 days. And spread of the disease begins AFTER symptoms occurs.  This “behavior” of COVID-19 may be by chance, but it appears to be the perfect biological weapon. Spreading fire, death, destruction, and geometic multiplication of infected people for a very long period before the infected spreader is identified.  According the medical journal, Lancet, COVID-19 doubles the number of infected people every 6.4 days. Just doing the math it’s quite easy to reach a million infected people in a month. This virus is even more infectious than the 1918 pandemic virus.  And finally regarding the distinguished Professor Ebrights’s assertion that no modification to the genome’s virus had been made, is premature. And he certainly does not have access to Chinese military genome studies on the virus.   POLITICS AS USUAL  In short, again the political Left is from the start⏤on the attack against those Americans in leadership who are trying to protect the country.  Clearly the Open Borders policy of the Democrat Party and their Democratic Socialist wing, are a superhighway inviting the COVID-19 to come into the country… and infect numbers of people before it is detected that will lead to the pandemic being out of control.  To put it bluntly, the evil genie of this biological weapon virus is out of the bottle and there’s no putting it back in. The number of infected people doubles every 6.4 days. But everyone can educate themselves and secure the optimal outcome. Prayer, following our doctor’s advice, and new nutritional methods should all else fail, contribute to optimal results.

In its recent report, the consultancy considered three possible scenarios for the country’s economy, depending on how long the restrictions stay in place. The decision to prolong the lockdown, announced on Saturday, renders the prediction with the mildest impact (10 percent contraction in the first quarter) impossible, as it was predicated on the measures being lifted on Tuesday.  Also on rt.com Nationwide lockdown could cost Indian economy over $4 BILLION A DAY  While it is not yet clear how much longer Indians will have to stay home, if the lockdown continues for an additional month, it could put 32 million livelihoods at risk and the country’s economy could contract by around 20 percent in the first quarter, McKinsey’s analysts warn.  However, annual results in this case would not be too devastating, with growth falling between two and three percent in the fiscal year 2021.   Read more  The worst-case scenario envisaged by the report said there could be an even deeper annual economic contraction of around eight to 10 percent. This might happen if the epidemic continues to ravage the country and the authorities have to impose additional restrictions that spill into the second quarter and beyond. This scenario would result in an “even greater reluctance among migrants to resume work, and [ensure] a much slower rate of recovery.”  To evaluate those risks, the consulting firm spoke with more than 600 economists, financial market experts and policy makers, in 100 companies across multiple sectors.  The potential economic fallout of the coronavirus would vary by sector, with aviation, the auto industry, construction and real estate taking the biggest hits. The demand in key categories would also drop sharply.  “Current-quarter consumption could drop by more than 30 percent in discretionary categories, such as clothing and furnishings, and by up to 10 percent in areas such as food and utilities,” the analysis said.

As containment measures intensify and provisional plans change on a daily basis, fans are getting used to how the immediate future could look in the world of sport.  Cancellations are almost certainly on the horizon, as history shows us. This is not the first time a pandemic has impacted sport, and it won't be the last. Sportsmail takes a look back through recent years to observe how things unfolded.  The outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) has brought the sporting world to its knees   Foot and mouth, 2001  The outbreak of foot and mouth in 2001 undoubtedly wrecked England's Six Nations campaign. The gap between the initial four matches and the delayed fixture in October cost the Red Rose the chance of a Slam by hindering momentum.  Wales and Ireland bowed to overwhelming concern over the possible spread of foot and mouth disease to call for a postponement to the tournament.  The outbreak of foot and mouth in 2001 undoubtedly wrecked England's Six Nations campaign  Concerns for both people and livestock grew, as the financial repercussions started to mount by the week.  Historically, the disease was also responsible for the postponement of the Irish leg of the 1967 All Blacks tour, while back in 1962 an Ireland-Wales game at Lansdowne Road had to be rescheduled for the following November after an outbreak of smallpox in South Wales.  Due to the obvious complications involved with this virus, spreading among livestock, it came as no surprise that the showpiece racing festival of Cheltenham was immediately axed.  In 2001 the spread of foot-and-mouth disease placed huge strain on the Cheltenham festival  Mayhem ensued, as event insurers faced soaring claims of £8million for the loss of the showcase meeting.  The betting industry was hit in the pockets to the tune of an estimated £100m. The festival annually attracts 200,000 spectators to Prestbury Park and is worth £10m to the local economy.  Last week, despite being in the throes of coronavirus spread, Cheltenham was given the green light and thousands turned out to enjoy what is set to be one of the last sporting mass gatherings for a while.  SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), 2003  After forcing an initial delay in the draw for the China FIFA Women's World Cup in 2003, the outbreak of SARS led to the decision to relocate the tournament and caused mass confusion.  The draw for the tournament was all set for 24 May in Wuhan, China (the location of the epicentre of the current coronavirus crisis) but was postponed by FIFA to April 10 in the light of SARS spreading rapidly across South-East Asia.  The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) was obliged to postpone two qualifying matches for the Olympic Football Tournament of Athens 2004 as a result.  The SARS outbreak decimated the sporting calendar in Asia and Australasia for months  Then, on 14 April, news arrived that the AFC had called off the Asian Women's Championship, three days before the tournament was due to begin in Thailand. The event, which doubled up as a qualifying competition for the FIFA Women's World Cup, was scheduled to run until 30 April.  It then came as no surprise to see China postpone the start of the domestic season for its men's and women's professional leagues across all divisions.  The SARS outbreak then claimed a major Australian sporting event, with the cancellation of the 2003 Arafura Games in Darwin.  The $2m, eight-day event was to kick off on May 17 but the Northern Territory's Chief Minister, Clare Martin, said there was simply too much uncertainty to ensure its success.  The Sevens rugby tournaments in Singapore and Beijing and Singapore's international horse racing day were also quickly shelved because of disease fears.   Swine flu pandemic, 2009  In 2009 it was estimated that 11 – 21 per cent of the global population contracted swine flu, as panic began to sweep the world.  Nobody knew just how potent the virus could become, though the fatality rate was in the end was relatively low, at about 0.01 - 0.08 per cent.  Between 150,000 and 575,000 people were thought to have died worldwide, as sport eventually felt the force of the illness.  Motor racing's A1GP series cancelled its final race of the season in Mexico, at least 10 golfers withdrew from a Canadian Tour event in Mexico and teams of Chinese and Malaysian divers scrapped plans to compete in the United States.  China's esteemed diving squad, which won seven gold medals in Beijing, pulled out of a meet  The Concacaf Under 17 championship in Tijuana was also cancelled, with Costa Rica, Honduras, Mexico and the US due to contest the semi-finals.  China's esteemed diving squad, which won seven of the eight gold medals on offer at the Beijing Olympics, withdrew from the Fina Grand Prix in Fort Lauderdale due to growing fears.  The Carribbean games, which were set to be hosted in Trinidad, were also axed. This despite 2,000 competitors and officials from 26 countries competing in six sports being expected to attend in the capital Port of Spain, to a cost $34.2m.  Athletes had started to test positive for H1N1 influenza and the risk of outbreak across all competitors was deemed to be severe.   Ebola, 2014-2015  The Ebola virus dominated the headlines several years ago, though many people failed to realise that an outbreak of the deadly virus had occurred time and time again across Africa in the past.  The continent was blighted, and African football was inevitably going to be affected and certain measures had to be put in place.  The 2015 African Cup of Nations was relocated to Equatorial Guinea, after Morocco refused to host the event fearing the spread of the virus at large gatherings.  Ebola caused mayhem and Equatorial Guinea had to host AFCON after Morocco refused  All football activities in Liberia were suspended, and the Antoinette Tubman Stadium in Monrovia was converted into an Ebola treatment unit.  Airlines suspended flights as people eschewed travel due to fear of infection in what one commentator termed 'an epidemic of ignorance'.  Now, in 2020, AFCON becomes impacted once more after match days three and four of the 2021 qualifiers, which were penciled in from 25th to the 30th of March, were postponed due to coronavirus.   Zika, 2016  Spread by the bite of the Aedes mosquito, the Zika virus outbreak of 2016 was most commonly associated with the Rio Olympic games, and created a huge saga regarding the well-being of athletes and spectators visiting the South American country.  Countless emerging meetings were held on the Zika virus as the world of sport sought clarity  Many international travelers to the Games considered skipping the event entirely to avoid the threat of Zika.  Despite the fears, not a single case of Zika or its major neurological complication, microcephaly, was reported by foreign visitors.  A series of high profile golf stars immediately pulled out of the competition insisting they would not put their health, or the health of family members, at risk.  Among them included Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson, Vijay Singh and Australia's Marc Leishman. In tennis Milos Raonic and Tomas Berdych snubbed the games, along with doubles champions Bob and Mike Bryan, and women's star Karolina Pliskova.  Calls to cancel the games persisted, while the World Health Organization declared the Zika virus a public health emergency of international concern. Nonetheless, the Olympics went ahead despite other athletes opting not to attend, and no competitors were affected.  In 2016 golf superstar Rory McIlroy rejected the prestige of the Olympics due to Zika fears   Coronavirus 2020  We currently find ourselves in unknown waters, after the rapid outbreak of COVID-19 has severely hampered the world's biggest sport — football.  Most top flight European leagues have been halted only for the first time since the start of the second World War. Italy, the worst hit country in Europe, has cancelled all sport indefinitely while on home shores the Premier League is not set to return until at least April 3.  Nobody really knows how things will pan out, given the intensity of the football calendar and the very limited room it has for manoeuvre. As reported by Sportsmail, a situation may arise where the Premier League is declared finished, handing runaway leaders Liverpool the title and seeing the structure of the league altered next season.  Saturday’s National League programme continued largely unaffected, despite the understandable cries of mutiny from those who accused the league of greed, but for how much longer it does so remains uncertain. Financial implications for the teams at the bottom of the football pyramid could be fatal.  Inside football stadiums, in weeks gone by, constant messages have been delivered to fans  The Formula One season has taken a huge hit, with it's curtain raising weekend in Australia axed and the whole campaign pushed backwards. Certain races, such as the Dutch Grand Prix making its return after a 35-year absence, now look in danger of being pulled.  Knock-on effects of the pandemic may be felt, even if numbers of the affected begin to steady and fall. Showpiece summer events including Wimbledon are under huge threat, while the eagerly anticipated multi-country EURO 2020 tournament is now a certainty to be moved.  The Tokyo Olympics are now in ongoing discussions, with a suggested move to a slot in 2022 in the pipeline.  Officials from the IOC and Tokyo 2020 have repeatedly insisted the Games will go ahead as planned in July and August.  The Olympics could be held in 2022 if coronavirus stops it going ahead in the summer  A postponement until later this year would mean the Games clashing with major professional sports leagues like the NFL, which would cause problems for NBC, the Olympic broadcasters in America.  However, putting the Tokyo Games back two years would spell disaster for the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, due to take place in July and August 2022.  Many months of uncertainty lie ahead, as sport comes to terms with the latest pandemic to sweep the globe. Now, lots of numbers are being crunched regarding how everything can fit back into place once more. Expect many twists and turns.

Ortom in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Tever Akase, said workers in the state have demonstrated uncommon determination and professionalism in all sectors to support the State Government in taking proactive measures to prevent the spread of the disease.  He specially commended workers who are on essential duties such as health and other services for putting in extra hours daily to ensure that Benue does not have additional COVID-19 cases, after the index case.  According to him, no amount of reward can adequately compensate the workers for their sacrifice to the state, and urges them to sustain that level of patriotism.  He also restated the resolve of his administration to ensure that the welfare of workers especially salaries and pensions remains its priority.  The Governor explained that Benue, like other states of the federation, had no option than to revise the 2020 Budget from N189 billion to N119 billion, in response to the impending global economic crisis which is estimated to contract the economy of Nigeria by 3.4%, a situation that will have an adverse impact on the states.  He stressed that as a result, his administration has embarked on a number of measures to boost agriculture and increase food production. One of such steps, he says, is the recent sale of 50 tractors to Benue farmers at 60 per cent subsidy.  Ortom maintained that as part of measures to mitigate the negative effect of the looming recession, the present administration has resolved to take advantage of Benue’s rich agricultural potentials, by not only producing food for consumption but also for commercial purposes.  This, the Governor pointed out, was what led to the setting up of the Agriculture Value Chain, Review and Development Cooperation Committee, with him as Chairman.  He, therefore, encouraged workers of the state and other Benue people to take advantage of the COVID-19 period which has forced many of them to stay at home and engage in massive farming.  Speaking on the fight against coronavirus, Ortom commended the people for the level of compliance with the rules on COVID-19.  He said he expects greater cooperation as the partial lockdown continues.  The Governor noted that though no new case of Coronavirus has been found in Benue, it is important that the people remain vigilant and adhere to preventive measures against the pandemic such as the use of face masks, hand sanitizers, frequent handwashing and social distancing  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 5, "positive": 22, "negative": 2, "disgust": 1, "joy": 3, "anger": 3, "fear": 6, "trust": 5}, "metadata": ["cooperation", "ensure", "global", "economic", "crisis", "economy", "adverse", "mitigate", "lockdown", "coronavirus", "pandemic", "distancing"]}, {"text": "The Lakers, recently ranked by Forbes as the second most valuable team in the NBA, applied for a federal loan through the Paycheck Protection Program.

When funding for the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program quickly ran out, the Lakers said it returned the money it had been given.  \"The Lakers qualified for and received a loan under the Payroll Protection Program,\" the Lakers said in a statement to ESPN and CNBC. \"Once we found out the funds from the program had been depleted, we repaid the loan so that financial support would be directed to those most in need.

At a hearing at the High Court in London today Detention Action, a charity that supports people held in immigration removal centres demanded that detainees with health conditions such as diabetes be immediately released.  The group says that, if its application is refused, 'significant numbers of immigration detainees will die or suffer very severe illness'.  Three detention centres across the UK are detaining people with coronavirus symptoms.  Detainees told the BBC that Brook House immigration removal centre (pictured) has been placed on 'lockdown'  The group's barrister Chris Buttler told the court that three people in three separate IRCs had tested positive for the virus in the last week.  He said one of the three, who is currently being detained at Brook House IRC, near Gatwick Airport, 'worked as a food server and was responsible for serving food to other detainees before he fell ill'.  Detainees at the centres claim they have been left without soap and unable to protect themselves against Covid-19.  The court was told that around 350 detainees had been released in recent days, but that more than 700 people still remain in detention.  Expert evidence from Richard Coker, professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, filed in support of Detention Action's case, states that it is 'plausible and credible' that 60% of detainees could become infected with Covid-19 in four weeks' time.  The group says, 'many of those detained in IRCs have arrived in the UK from countries and areas where there is already a significant spread of Covid-19, such as Iran, China and Italy'.  It also warns the situation poses 'a danger to public health nationally.'  Mr Buttler said that a failure to address the risk of the virus spreading through IRCs would 'undermine the country's effort to delay the point at which the NHS's critical care capacity will be overwhelmed' and 'contribute to the overburdening of the NHS'.  This is while a woman who suffers with asthma and has been held at Yarl's Wood IRC for three years, has already tested positive for Covid-19 and been placed in isolation after showing symptoms.  Colnbrook Immigration Removal Centre in Harmondsworth, west London  This is while a woman who suffers with asthma and has been held at Yarl's Wood IRC (above) for three years, has already tested positive for Covid-19 and been placed in isolation after showing symptoms  Detainees told the BBC that Brook House immigration removal centre has been placed on 'lockdown'.  Bella Sankey, director of Detention Action, said in a witness statement that another detainee at Brook House had seen that man 'carried from his cell by centre staff after falling ill with Covid-19 symptoms and being too weak to be able to walk', just a day after he had been serving other detainees food.  Ms Sankey also told the court that at least four new detainees were brought to Yarl's Wood IRC, near Bedfordshire, on Tuesday 'despite the fact that a detainee at Yarl's Wood recently tested positive for Covid-19'.  Mr Buttler continued that there was 'a mismatch' between the Government's guidance on Covid-19 and the approach taken in IRCs, all but one of which 'continue to operate as congregate settings, save where an individual is symptomatic or known to have been in contact with symptomatic individuals'.  He added: 'Delays in introducing suppression measures will cost lives.'  Mr Buttler submitted that the 'overcrowded and unsanitary conditions' at many IRCs, combined with the absence of professional cleaners and unsanitary healthcare facilities, increase the risk of those detained contracting the virus.  He said that on Monday, detainees at Harmondsworth IRC, near Heathrow Airport, reported cells being 'flooded with dirty water up to the ankle'.  A Home Office spokesman said: 'Handwashing facilities are available in all immigration removal centres as well as dedicated health facilities run by doctors and nurses, and all staff are following the latest guidance from Public Health England.  'Decisions to detain are made on a case-by-case basis and kept under constant review, but our priority is to maintain the lawful detention of the most high-harm individuals, including foreign national offenders.'  Detention Action claims a 'significant proportion' of the roughly 1,500 people held in immigration detention have serious underlying health conditions which leave them facing 'a significant risk of serious harm or death'.  The group also argues that 'significant numbers of detainees will no longer be detainable because widespread travel restrictions prevent removals from taking place', rendering their detention unlawful.  At a hearing in London today, its lawyers asked for the release of 'every detainee with a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, cancer or chronic kidney disease' pending a full trial, unless the Home Office can demonstrate 'a clear overriding public protection concern'.  Detention Action says that, if its application is refused, 'significant numbers of immigration detainees will die or suffer very severe illness'.  The case is thought to be the first Covid-19-related case heard in the courts of England and Wales.  Two of Detention Action's clients with diabetes are still being held in Harmondsworth IRC.  One is 67 years old and both report being extremely concerned about being infected with Covid-19.  Ms Sankey told MailOnline: ''It totally unnecessary for the Government to carry on detaining people while Covid-19 presents such a serious threat to hundreds of lives in immigration detention centres and to the wider community as detention staff move in and out.  'But instead of acting sensibly at a time of national crisis, Priti Patel's Home Office has used up precious time and money herding more people into detention, including those exhibiting covid-19 symptoms who were trying to self-isolate.  'There is a common misconception that people are held in immigration detention centres for the public's protection. They are not. That's what prisons are for. Detention is only used for administrative purposes to facilitate removals from the UK but most are ultimately released back into the community. While Covid-19 travel restrictions prevent removals, detention is not necessary.'  Morton Hall in Lincolnshire has also been affected, according to the BBC  In grounds of claim filed with the High Court, the charity says: 'Every day of delay significantly increases the risk of serious harm or death to thousands of individuals who are under the state's complete control and have no way to protect themselves from Covid-19.  'It is well-known that many asylum seekers entering the UK having travelled overland through Europe will have passed through Italy.'  The Home Office published guidance last week aimed at reducing the spread of Covid-19 in places of detention by placing 'symptomatic individuals' in quarantine.  But Detention Action argues that the guidance is 'ineffective' and 'will not halt the rapid spread of Covid-19 in immigration removal centres', as it 'incorrectly assumes that most transmission of the virus results from symptomatic individuals'.  A Home Office spokesman added: 'Immigration enforcement is responding to the unique circumstances of the coronavirus outbreak and decisions to detain are made on a case-by-case basis.

Industry players said that while they have witnessed progress with State and district level approvals, they are still working to resolve challenges related to shortage of trucks and availability of workers as the country battles the Covid-19 outbreak.   Grievance cell  The Food Processing Ministry set up a grievance redressal cell to look into issues being faced by the packaged food industry last week. It also held a video-conferencing interaction with key industry bodies and stakeholders on Monday after urging State government to allow food units to operate.  Pushpa Subrahmanyam, Secretary, Food Processing Ministry, told BusinessLine, “We are attempting to resolve various issues of the industry related to closure of factories, warehouses, cold storages as well problems with inter-State movements..which we have received from industry associations and individual units. We have taken up these grievances with the State governments and many of them have been resolved. About 10 per cent of them were related to clarifications on MHA notification.”  According to sources, nearly 221 grievances were registered so far with the Ministry, while 98 of them have been resolved, 105 are under resolution.   Migration of workers  On Sunday, the Home Ministry also allowed transportation of both essential and non-essential goods and at the same time expanded the list of essential goods to include hygiene products. However, large scale reverse migration of workers to their home States is now posing as a bigger challenge for essential good manufacturers and supply chains.  Vivek Gambhir, Managing Director and CEO, Godrej Consumer Products Ltd, said the recent Central government guidelines will help ease the existing supply chain bottlenecks.  “Consequently, we are seeing some progress on-ground. Some factories have received permissions to manufacture essential hygiene products, at reduced capacity. Some CFAs too have received permissions to distribute goods. However, the number of workers reporting to factory/distributor locations is still very low due to social pressure and safety concerns,” he said.  Mayank Shah, Category Head, Parle Products, said the industry is likely to attain uninterrupted operations at factories, though with scaled down workforces in line with government directives, by next week and will be able to meet the demand of the consumers to a large extent.   Streamlining movement  A spokesperson for ITC too said, while the company has progressively obtained permissions in some States, availability of trucks continues to be the biggest challenge at the moment. “Inter-State and local truck movement has been severely impacted together with the challenge of shortage of manpower in factories. We believe it will take a few more days for the entire eco-system and processes to be streamlined for movement of essential goods,” the spokesperson added.  Stating that Central government directives has helped re-starting factory operations and some part of logistics operations, Piyush Patnaik, Managing Director, Cargill’s oils business in India, said more support on free movement of trucks and availability of labour is needed.  Dabur India Ltd Executive Director-Operations Shahrukh Khan said that situation has eased a bit with approvals for plant operations and bottlenecks of raw materials, packaging materials and finished products.  However, he added with most workers either leaving for their hometowns or staying at home during the lockdown, it would be a challenge to ensure smooth functioning.

The community is fearlessly engaged in relief activities in the world's hardest hit country US and it's campaign's major target is the New York City where majority of fatalities are reported by the US authorities.  \"Since this pandemic has changed the entire world a couple of months ago, we were the first South Asian organization in the America which has launched a major initiative to help those people who are in need,\" a representative of American Pakistani Advocacy Group (APAG) Ali Rashid said during the Virtual Town Hall Meeting arranged by the Pakistani Americans to discuss issues faced by their countrymates in the US.  \"Our efforts would not only improve the image of Pakistan but also ensure the safety of Pakistani diaspora, spread across the US,\" he added.  Ali Rashid informed the forum that his organizations had been delivering ration and other essential items at the door steps of those people who were unable to visit the grocery shops due to lockdowns in various cities of the US.  \"So far, we have distributed 800 full grocery packages among Pakistan community, especially to the families of blue collar workers.\" He said since the holy month of Ramazan was fast approaching, an order of more 500 such packages had been given to ensure uninterrupted supply of rice, wheat flour and other essential edibles for the Pakistani families. \"The cities do not provide those items to Pakistanis which they required actually. They only provide cane food.\" Highlighting another initiative which was meant to offer free lunch to those Americans who were at the forefront in the fight against the coronavirus, he said: \"With such initiatives, we have changed the narrative about Pakistan and show that what actually Pakistani community can do.\" Pervaiz Riaz, a businessman from the US, said he had given free disinfected services to the doctors, nurses and other frontline fighters.  \"We have disinfected homes and police stations to ensure safety of the first responders.'

He said 866,250 USD had been spent on distribution of food and ration. \"700,000 Pounds of food have been delivered to the people's homes that included 22,377 boxes cooked meal.\" Moviz said 565 volunteers had been working across the US that also involved a large number of Pakistani women. Hotlines had also been set up to provide medical assistance to the people, he added.  \"Right from the day one, when guidelines about coronavirus and its possible impact given to us, our consulates and community together have been very proactive in getting the message out, reaching out the people and highlighting the community efforts,\" said Pakistan's Consul General Ayesha Ali.  Pakistani organizations were playing key role in providing multiple services to the people including ration, funeral services, financial assistance and accommodations, she added.  Pakistani Ambassador to the US Asad Majeed said he had special appreciation for those people who had opened their homes for the stranded Pakistanis after closure of international flights. \"This reflects generosity of Pakistanis,\" he added.  Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Overseas Pakistanis Zulfikar Bukhari, who also joined the special session from here, appreciated the Pakistani diaspora for taking care of their community in such trying times.

School districts across the country have shuttered schools, bars and nightclubs have been closed, and restaurants are increasingly serving take-out food only. With at least 3,485 confirmed cases and 65 fatalities in the U.S., officials have taken drastic measures to encourage social distancing, changing how Americans eat, work, and study. Globally, the number of fatalities have surpassed 6,500, according to an estimate from Johns Hopkins University.  Here is your COVID-19 update for Monday, March 16.  CDC Recommends All Events of 50 People or More Be Canceled or Delayed Until May  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended on Sunday that people begin avoiding groups or events of 50 people or more until at least early May.  \"Large events and mass gatherings can contribute to the spread of COVID-19 in the United States via travelers who attend these events and introduce the virus to new communities. Examples of large events and mass gatherings include conferences, festivals, parades, concerts, sporting events, weddings, and other types of assemblies. These events can be planned not only by organizations and communities but also by individuals,\" the CDC said on its website.  \"Events of any size should only be continued if they can be carried out with adherence to guidelines for protecting vulnerable populations, hand hygiene, and social distancing. When feasible, organizers could modify events to be virtual,\" the statement added.  The recommendation doesn't apply to day-to-day operations of places like schools, institutes of higher learning, or businesses.  The recommendation would mean most public events in the U.S. would be shutdown over the next eight weeks.  The CDC noted that its guidance wasn't \"intended to supersede the advice of local public health officials.\"  The recommendation from the CDC is meant to encourage \"social distancing\" which health experts say can help the country's health care system from being overwhelmed by \"flattening the curve\" - or the rate of infections.  Dozens of major events have been cancelled over the last week with the NBA, NHL and MLB all suspending or pushing back the start of their seasons. Several states have also elected to issue orders, or ask that bars and restaurants be closed in an effort to curb the spread of the virus.  On Sunday, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti ordered that all bars, nightclubs, restaurants (except takeout/delivery), entertainment venues and gyms to be closed until March 31.  Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is also expected to order all bars and restaurants close at 3 p.m. ET today. Restaurants will still be allowed to serve takeout and delivery.

But public health officials warn that the current “Wild West” of unregulated tests is creating confusion that could ultimately slow the path to recovery.  More than 70 companies have signed up to sell so-called antibody tests in recent weeks, according to US regulators. Governments around the world hope that the rapid tests, which typically use a finger-prick of blood on a test strip, could soon ease public restrictions by identifying people who have previously had the virus and have developed some immunity to it.  But key questions remain: How accurate are the tests, how much protection is needed and how long will that protection last.  The blood tests are different from the nasal swab-based tests currently used to diagnose active COVID-19 infections. Instead, the tests look for blood proteins called antibodies, which the body produces days or weeks after fighting an infection. The same approach is used for HIV, hepatitis, Lyme disease, lupus and many other diseases.  Because of the relative simplicity of the technology, the Food and Drug Administration decided to waive initial review of the tests as part of its emergency response to the coronavirus outbreak.  Right now, the tests are most useful for researchers studying how the virus has spread through the US population. The government said Friday it has started testing 10,000 volunteers. The White House has not outlined a broader plan for testing and how the results might be used.  With almost no FDA oversight of the tests, “Right now it’s a wild west show out there,” said Eric Blank of the Association for Public Health Laboratories. “It really has created a mess that’s going to take a while to clean up.”  “In the meantime, you’ve got a lot of companies marketing a lot of stuff and nobody has any idea of how good it is,” he said.  Members of Blank’s group, which represents state and local lab officials, have urged the FDA to revisit its lax approach toward the tests. That approach essentially allows companies to launch as long as they notify the agency and include disclaimers. Companies are supposed to state that their tests have not been FDA-approved and cannot rule out whether someone is currently infected.  Last week, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said in a statement that the agency will “take appropriate action” against companies making false claims or selling inaccurate tests.  During an interview Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Hahn expressed “concern” that tests being sold “may not be as accurate as we’d like them to be.”  “What we don’t want are wildly inaccurate tests,” he said. “That’s going to be much worse, having wildly inaccurate tests than having no test.”  Dr. Allison Rakeman of New York City’s Public Health Laboratory says some local hospitals are assuming the tests, which are listed on FDA’s website, “have been vetted, when they have not.”  The danger of faulty testing, Rakeman says, is that people will mistakenly conclude that they are immune or are no longer spreading the virus.  “Then somebody goes home and kisses their 90-year-old grandmother,” said Rakeman. “You don’t want to give someone a false sense of security.”  For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.  For many infections, antibody levels above a certain threshold indicate that the person’s immune system has successfully fought off the virus and is likely protected from reinfection. For COVID-19, it’s not yet clear what level of antibodies render patients immune or how long immunity might last.  Adding to the confusion is the fact that both legitimate companies and fraudulent operators appear to be selling the kits. Distinguishing between the two can be a challenge.  Officials in Laredo, Texas, reported this month that some 2,500 antibody tests set for use at a local drive-thru testing site were likely frauds. City officials had ordered what they were told were “FDA-approved COVID-19 rapid tests,” from a local clinic. But when they checked the test’s accuracy, it fell well below the range promised, the city said in a statement.  Examples of US companies skirting the rules appear online and in emails sent to hospitals.  Promotional emails sent to hospitals and reviewed by The Associated Press failed to include required disclaimers. Some kits sold on websites promote themselves as “FDA-approved” for home testing. The agency has not yet approved any COVID-19 home test. The blood tests have to processed by a lab.  “If you see them on the internet, do not buy them until we can give you a test that’s reliable for all Americans,” said Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, at a recent briefing.  20/20 BioResponse is one of dozens of US companies selling the tests to hospitals, clinics and doctor’s offices. The Rockville, Maryland-based company imports the tests from a Chinese manufacturer but CEO Jonathan Cohen says his company independently confirmed its performance in 60 US patients. He estimates the company has shipped 10,000 tests and has had to limit orders due to demand.  He said antibody tests are not a “panacea but they’re not garbage either.”  Cohen called them “a tool in the toolbox that will have some value along with other tests.”  The company’s test is registered on the FDA website and includes all the required disclaimers.  To date, the FDA has only authorized one COVID-19 antibody test from North Carolina diagnostics company Cellex. The agency used its emergency powers, meaning a formal review is still needed.  The White House has also tried to temper expectations for the tests, while still promising that millions will soon be available.  Dr Brett Giroir, the federal health official overseeing US testing, told reporters a week ago that the FDA and other agencies are working to confirm the accuracy of the antibody tests.  “We’re going to be very careful to make sure that when we tell you you’re likely immune from the disease … the test really said that,” Giroir said.

They announced in February they were expecting their first child and that they were engaged to be married.  Once dubbed \"Bonking Boris\" by Britain's tabloid media, Johnson has had a complicated private life.  He was once sacked from the Conservative Party's policy team while in opposition for lying about an extra-marital affair. He has been divorced twice and refuses to say how many children he has fathered.  In 2013, when Johnson was mayor of London, appeal court judges ruled that the public had the right to know he had an extra-marital affair with a woman who gave birth to his daughter.  Johnson's previous marriage was to Marina Wheeler, a lawyer. They had four children together but announced in September 2018 that they had separated. They divorced earlier this year.  Few British leaders have had babies while in office.  David Cameron's wife, Samantha, gave birth to their daughter, Florence, in 2010 and Tony Blair's wife, Cherie, gave birth to their son, Leo, in 2006.

Speaking to the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Dr Nabarro said: \"The issue here is to try to make sure that as few people as possible get impossible and those who get infected get appropriately looked after in the community or in hospital.  \"In order to do that, it’s really important to take the heat out of transmission and that does mean helping people to stay further away from each other and reduce them getting infected.\"  The WHO special envoy suggested cases across Italy, the European country with the highest number of coronavirus cases recorded, showed community transmission is helping the virus take hold in some countries.  He continued: \"As we look at the way in which this epidemic is evolving around the world, it’s clearly taking hold in some countries with what we describe community transmission, that’s transmission between people in local areas.  \"I would imagine in the UK the thinking is as follows - the outbreak is here, people are getting sick and, unfortunately, some are dying.

Mr AbdulRazaq said this on Tuesday at a press briefing on the first two cases of coronavirus virus recorded in the state.  PREMIUM TIMES reported how two cases of the disease was discovered on Monday.  Related to the development, the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital suspended a senior consultant, Kazeem Salami, a professor of medicine who kept vital information from his colleagues at the hospital about the first suspected case, Muideen Obanimomo, who later died at the facility.  The two cases of COVID-19 in the state, which were earlier confirmed by the governor’s media aide, Rafiu Ajakaye, and the state Technical Committee on the disease, include the wife of Mr Obanimomo, who along with her husband just returned from the UK when he died.  The second infected person was also revealed as a UK returnee.  However, speaking at the press briefing at the Government House, Ilorin, Mr AbdulRazaq told the residents that Coronavirus is real and that the two cases earlier announced are true and urged them to keep safe by adhering to basic precautions announced by the federal government and health agencies.  On why entry points to the the state are still open, Mr Abdulrasaq said they, especially the highway to Lagos, cannot be shut down at the moment because of people transporting food through the route from the northern part of the country to to Kwara and other states.  He also explained why the markets are still operating in the state.  “As you all know that the government cannot provide food for everyone, therefore, the market may not be totally shut down as people may need to get some foodstuff for themselves,” he added.  Mr AbdulRazaq also disclosed plans of the federal government to set up testing centres across the country.  He said the only COVID-19 testing centre close to the state is in Ibadan, adding that the federal government would establish a testing centre in Kwara as part of the third phase for the national project.   Contact tracing  The governor said 75 contacts of the infected patients had been traced and are being monitored by the Rapid Response Team of the medical advisory committee.  “Our job is cut out for us and we are definitely not dropping the ball. Contact tracing by the Rapid Response Team of the medical advisory committee has so far netted 75 persons who have had contacts with the cases and the suspected case at UITH.

As we saw the state Republican Party of Wisconsin in a Facebook group helping to organize the rally told people to leave their Trump gear, their confederate flags, and their AK-47s at home to manage the optics of this protest.  “But he knows and we all know that the whole Republican apparatus is supporting in-person protests that puts people at risk. Robin Vos, Scott Fitzgerald, and Wisconsin’s Republican state legislature have sued to end the stay-at-home order to override emergency powers to protect the public’s help and to force the opening the state’s economy before public health officials believe it is safe to presume business as usual…They want to extend this crisis and put people’s lives at risk…  “All of these people from Vos to President Trump to Scott Fitzgerald to Republicans in the state legislature and candidates running for office know what they are doing is wrong. They believe they can benefit politically from a protest movement that ignores the dangerous science of Coronavirus’s spread.  “[2 weeks ago] Wisconsin rejected their voter suppression techniques and rejected Trump’s hand-picked choice for the state Supreme Court…We’re now seeing the consequences of what they did: we know of 19 people who tested positive for Coronavirus after voting or working as poll workers…We may never know the true number of people who contracted coronavirus at the polls…We’ve seen an increase in the daily cases of coronavirus cases…We know [Trump, Vos, Fitzgerald] are doing nothing to reduce the risk of people going out to protest today.  “The Republican effort to ignore science, ignore public health, ignore the lives and safety of their own constituents and all Wisconsinites goes in the face not only of common sense but also of morality… What Republicans are doing today in supporting an in-person protest that could spread infection will hurt the economy, will hurt workers, and will hurt the health of Wisconsinites, especially ethos most at risk of COVID-19.”  If you would like the full video of video press conference please email [email protected]  ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND: Donald Trump, Wisconsin Republicans, And the Threat They Pose To Wisconsinites  In some of Donald Trump’s latest press briefings, he has helped incite the protests against the stay-at-home orders we are seeing take place across this country, and what is expected to happen on a very large scale at Wisconsin’s state capitol tomorrow. When asked if these protestors should follow the orders of the state governors, Trump has given responses that claimed people were keeping a safe distance from one another when they weren’t, that the protesters seem to be his supporters and respect him, and that they are simply expressing themselves. Trump cannot bring himself to tell Wisconsinites and the American people to do what is in best interest of keeping people safe and opening the economy up in a timely manner: Stay at home.  While the President has shown he doesn’t take this public health crisis seriously enough beyond his talking points, Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers has made it a priority to keep Wisconsinites safe, as his health secretary recently extended the stay-at-home deadline to May 26th. At the same time, the governor has recognized the need to open the state’s economy back up, and has put in place a plan that follows the guidelines put forth by Dr. Deborah Birx and Anthony Fauci.  Despite this, Assembly Leader Robin Vos and State Senate Majority leader are challenging the stay at home order in court, while they and their fellow Republican legislators encourage people to attend the mass protest on Friday. This will undoubtedly get people sick, further burden the state’s health care system, and leave some families and communities reeling from the loss of life that will follow. Beyond the sheer lack of care for public safety that the president and his fellow Republicans are showing by encouraging these protests, they also know that it is dangerous.  President Trump admitted that Georgia was wrong to open its nail salons, tattoo parlors, and massage parlors because it would be impossible to follow proper social distance guidelines; the state Republican Party of Wisconsin just moved their state convention back to July because they don’t want to have a mass gathering of attendees, and just over three weeks ago when the infection rate in Wisconsin was lower, Robin Vos dressed in full PPE told people it “perfectly safe” to go out and vote in person.  The state is already seeing an infection rate spike of COVID-19, with 19 cases reported as a result of the in-person election Trump, Vos, Fitzgerald, and their conservatives allies forced upon the state. They did so because they thought they could score a political victory, but Trump’s endorsed candidate still ended up losing by more than 10 points. Their encouragement of people to go to the polls and their dismissal of the need to adhere to stay at home orders will put an even greater strain on the health care system as they callously risk Wisconsinites’ lives.  Wisconsin Republicans are obstructing progress in the fight against Coronavirus as President Trump, beyond his failure to take this Coronavirus seriously when he first learned about the deadly virus, refuses to mobilize a national testing a contact tracing program. His administration previously promised to have 27,000,000 million tests in the market by March 28th. They have fallen well short of that goal.  Donald Trump, Robin Vos, Scott Fitzgerald, and their allies are a danger to the lives of Wisconsinites.   ###  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 18, "positive": 39, "negative": 15, "disgust": 1, "joy": 11, "anger": 15, "surprise": 7, "fear": 9, "trust": 12}, "metadata": ["donald", "wisconsin", "protests", "deaths", "trump", "briefing", "protective", "promoting", "facebook", "economy", "crisis", "supreme", "coronavirus", "ignore", "guidelines", "senate", "families", "georgia", "parlors", "convention", "ppe", "spike", "deadly", "tracing"]}, {"text": "An employee makes coffee at a restaurant in Mong Kok, Hong Kong, that serves Singaporean hawker food prepared by staff with mental and physical disabilities.

As the incidences of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) among nuclear power plant workers spread across the U.S. nuclear power fleet, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is poised to relax nuclear power plant safety inspections and maintenance required by reactor operating licenses.  The NRC will also allow nuclear utilities to require their control room operators, onsite security forces, fire brigades and other critical site personnel to work substantially longer fatiguing shifts.  The deferral of the safety-related tasks and relaxation of work hour controls are needed, they say, to comply with “social distancing” recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and to respond to the anticipated attrition of a workforce stricken by the highly contagious and debilitating pandemic.  Yet at the same time, the industry and the NRC are crowding nuclear power plants with as many as 1,600 workers, brought in from across the country, to conduct reactor refueling operations. Fourteen reactors are presently shut down, primarily for refueling, and more reactors are scheduled to halt for refueling through the end of May.  “The nuclear industry and its regulator, the NRC, are maximizing the industry’s power production by pressing onward with scheduled reactor refueling outages,” said Paul Gunter, Director of Reactor Oversight at Beyond Nuclear.  “Yet at the same time, they are using CDC Covid-19 guidelines to defer scheduled and required inspections and maintenance of critical safety components until the next refueling cycle eighteen months away,” he said.  “The regulator and the industry know full well that they are rolling in a Covid-19 Trojan Horse with these refueling crews travelling from one reactor site and community to the next,” said Gunter.  Workers at plants that are refueling, such as Limerick in Pennsylvania, have publicly expressed alarm at the overcrowded conditions, describing workers sitting “elbow to elbow” in canteens and computer labs, and saying they are “terrified” that this will lead to widespread infections of the novel coronavirus.  Despite this, the industry is also requesting that the NRC defer inspections and delay maintenance required under reactor operating licenses of critical safety components and systems, including steam generators and reactor emergency core cooling systems, until the next refueling cycle eighteen months away. It says this is in order to observe the CDC guidelines for slowing the growth of the pandemic, while maintaining a minimum onsite workforce still fit for duty at operating reactors.  SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Never Miss a Beat. Get our best delivered to your inbox.  In anticipation of more and more workers falling ill to the debilitating virus, the NRC and industry are collaborating to relax “fitness for duty” licensing requirements meant to prevent the over-fatigue of operators and other critical plant workers including security.  “Nuclear plant operators on extended 12-hour shifts, who can now be assigned to work two consecutive 84-hour weeks, will suffer excessive fatigue,” Gunter said. “This not only compromises their immune systems, but makes catastrophic mistakes more likely.” The infamous nuclear accident at the Three Mile Island Unit 2 nuclear power station near Harrisburg, PA in the early morning hours of March 28, 1979, was attributed to mechanical failure worsened by operator fatigue and error.  In response to the public health emergency brought on by Covid-19, which mandates social distancing, the operators at Braidwood 2 in Illinois, Comanche Peak 2 in Texas, and Turkey Point 3 in Florida have all requested an 18-month delay on inspections and maintenance of the thousands of steam generator tubes that are required to be examined during the current refueling outage in April and May 2020.  Steam generators are critical to both power operations and reactor safety, as the tubes represent 50% of the reactor pressure boundary and recirculate vital cooling water through the reactor core. The reactors’ harsh operational environment places extreme stresses on the heat transfer component, causing tube degradation from vibration, heat, radiation, corrosion and cracking that must be guarded against through routine inspection and maintenance.  The price for ignoring the condition of steam generator tubes can be high, as was demonstrated in February 2000 when a similarly deferred inspection was attributed to a steam generator tube rupture at the Indian Point Unit 2 nuclear reactor just 30 miles from New York City. The single steam tube rupture released radioactivity into the environment and could have been severe had the high pressure rupture caused a cascading guillotine effect on neighboring tubes and a loss of coolant accident.  “It is a reckless contradiction that the nuclear industry is using social distancing restrictions to defer inspections of steam generator tubes while threatening the spread of the virus through thousands of workers moving around the country to refuel reactors,” Gunter said. “Once again, the nuclear industry and a captured regulator are putting financial interests ahead of the wellbeing and safety of workers and the surrounding communities,” he said.  “The NRC should suspend these refueling outages and delay the restart of reactors currently down for refueling until a Disaster Initiated Review of the pandemic’s impact on emergency preparedness can be completed, something that the Federal Emergency Management Agency should already be doing with the NRC,” Gunter added.  “It is not hard to imagine the level of chaos that would ensue should a nuclear accident occur during the current coronavirus crisis,” Gunter continued. “Emergency preparedness plans are already inadequate, but the prospect of a mandatory mass evacuation at a time like this is an impossible choice,” he said. “It is the duty of the NRC and FEMA to ensure workable emergency preparedness plans and procedures are in place before restarting any of the reactors currently refueling,” Gunter concluded.  Beyond Nuclear also recommends strategically powering down some reactors in areas where there is reduced demand induced by the pandemic and pre-pandemic excess regional generating capacity. The workforces at shuttered reactors could then supplement those over-stretched at reactors still operating.   ###  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 9, "positive": 20, "negative": 16, "sadness": 1, "disgust": 2, "joy": 1, "anger": 13, "fear": 16, "trust": 7}, "metadata": ["significantly", "risks", "viral", "coronavirus", "paul", "oversight", "cdc", "guidelines", "licenses", "ill", "attributed", "peak", "turkey", "florida", "requested", "indian", "distancing", "virus", "mandatory", "ensure", "pandemic"]}, {"text": "To subscribe to Capitol Fax, click here. Pritzker says 4,000 tests per day being done, 10K tests per day in ten days - Bemoans federal red tape - Warns landlords against evictions - Asked about construction sites - “We have not hit the peak” - Promises Downstate visit; “Weeks to go” before peak - Says “There’s not enough [hospital] capacity,” points to efforts to expand Sunday, Mar 29, 2020 * From Gov. Pritzker’s press conference… Even though we’ve moved past the point of pure containment, it remains a priority to further build our testing abilities in part to understand the presence and spread of COVID 19 across the state. In our last testing announcement on the 24th, we were running about 2000 tests per day across our three state labs, our four commercial labs and our 15 hospital labs. Today we’re now averaging around 4000 tests per day. And in total we have now run nearly 28,000 tests here in Illinois with 30 Hospital and clinical laboratories now up and running. Within the next 10 days we believe that we will be up to 10,000 tests per day. Again, we’re at 4000 today. That marker 10,000 is significant because it’s the number of tests per day that the scientists and experts tell us that we need to get a truly holistic understanding of the virus in each of our hundred and two counties. Right now we’re working with roughly the same data that the majority of states are working with. That gives our state a rough picture of the viruses landscape across our state and in our municipalities by extrapolating the data using modeling largely based on the viruses spread in other countries. This 10,000 a day marker will give us the data to run a more mathematically significant model that offers us improved insight into how well our interventions are working. Ultimately, my goal is to reach a large enough testing capacity, where we’re able to test. Everyone who needs a test on a regular basis. But for right now all of the experts point to 10,000 tests as the standard that we need to achieve again. Again, I want to be frank with you, where we are now is not where I want to be. Every day we aren’t hitting 10,000 tests or more is another day that we’re not able to get answers that help us get past this current crisis. And to be clear though, loss of essentially the entire month of February in the effort to scale up robust testing, and the exponential spread that followed, was a profound failing of the federal government. State leaders have spent every day since then, trying to correct for this foundational mistake. Nationally, there have been some improvements in testing, but we still have so far to go. The United States is still trailing other countries in testing on a per capita basis, several times over. In all the states we are working to fill the gap. But the most frustrating part of this gap is, it’s not just in the past. The White House has promised millions of tests for weeks now and they’re just not here. To be clear, I also welcome the testing capacity when it actually arrives, but I’m not going to wait on promises from the federal government that may never be fulfilled. We need this testing capacity now, so we’re building it ourselves in Illinois. Here’s how we’re getting there. All three of our state labs are running a second shift of technicians to run samples, and we’ll be adding a third shift when we can get our hands on an even larger supply of the reagent and viral transport media, and other material elements needed beyond the swabs themselves. Second, and this is key, we’re acquiring additional laboratory robotics to load our 12 real time PCR machines at a multi thousand unit increase in single day capacity. We’re getting our first two machines on loan. And we’ll have them up and running by Tuesday, and we expect the others later this week. This technology is crucial, as it replaces manual loading and shrinks down the bottleneck for results. We’re working with the University of Illinois discovery partners Institute to ensure our staffing and logistics reflects this increased capacity, as well as exploring options with the Illinois State Police to utilize their manpower to move materials and equipment to maximize daily capacity at each of our three state labs. You also might have heard that Friday, Abbott Laboratories, an Illinois company announced a portable five minute rapid test for COVID 19. That same night I picked up the phone and I spoke with the president of Abbott, and the CEO of Abbott separately to ask that Illinois be first in line. I’m proud to say that they expressed their real dedication to taking care of their home state, and will be very helpful to us here in Illinois as their production ramps up. In a parallel effort, we’re collaborating with our university and hospital partners to ensure Illinois’ commercial testing can grow as fast as possible. As for our drive-thru testing, we’ve added a fifth facility since our last testing update the Illinois National Guard, really truly an amazing group, the Illinois National Guard has opened up a second state run drive thru testing facility in McLean county yesterday, joining our Harwood heights community based testing site in northwest Chicago, and the three federal HHS sites in Bolingbrook North Lake and Joliet. Our state run sites have been a huge success. And in addition to our McLean county site. We’re investigating additional areas around the state to launch potential drive thru locations symptomatic first responders healthcare workers seniors and all people with underlying health conditions will be able to visit these sites. * Federal red tape and delays… Still, due to the federal government requiring federal personnel representation at our two state drive throughs we remain tied to a 250 test cap at each of these locations. We know there’s greater need at our longer running Harwood Heights site. We’ve been hitting 250 tests by just the early afternoon, and having to turn people away. We’d like to be able to test more than 400 people a day at these sites and think that we can. We have the capacity to do so. So we’re pushing the federal government to change their requirements and allow us to test more than 250 people were turning people away that we just shouldn’t have to. And we asked the federal government to remove their restriction. We’re also pressuring the federal government on the return timelines of these tests. The private labs contracted by the federal government are taking four to seven days, sometimes even up to 10 days to turn around results. That is far too long. We’re doing it much faster in the state of Illinois, with the capacity that we have. * Evictions… We’re seeing news stories out of other states about nurses being thrown out of apartments or are denied the ability to rent their apartments out of fear of exposure by other tenants. We’ve not yet specifically heard of instances like that here in Illinois. But let me be very clear, that will not be tolerated in our state. I want to remind everyone that evictions are prohibited during this disaster to begin with. But I also want to make sure that landlords are not inappropriately terminating leases. So let me say this here in Illinois we are fortunate to have a very strong community of attorneys that are ready to fight for nurses and for all healthcare workers to make sure that their rights are protected. If any healthcare workers encounter this situation. They should immediately contact the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law for assistance. * On to questions for the governor. Why haven’t construction projects been halted? Some are complaining that they are working too close together on the sites… Well, it’s certainly up to the companies that are doing the construction to make sure that people are social distancing that are working there. There should be an opportunity at most construction sites to do that. But to the extent that they’re not able to, that is a concern certainly for me and it should be for the owners of the companies that people are operating those construction sites. So anybody that is concerned about that certainly should be reporting that to the Department of Public Health or letting my administration know, because there is, remember that much of what is being done is essential work that’s been determined at least as essential under our order and we don’t want anybody to be at risk but but we also want to make sure that we’re, you know, continuing the necessary work across the state. So please, anybody that’s experiencing that should let us know. Again, please pardon all typos. * Asked about closures of local parks and forest preserves… Those decisions are being made on a city by city, county by county basis, and should be by the locals there. * Reached the peak?… No we have not hit the peak here in Chicago, or in the state of Illinois and we’re going to continue to see an increase unfortunately of cases, and likely deaths. * There have been a lot of reports nationally about the PPE shelf life extension program. Has the federal government let Illinois extend the shelf life of COVID 19 intensive supplies and how big is that stockpile?… All of the PPE that we have in the state anything that is expired or deemed to be expired is being checked it’s being sampled and checked. According to the regulations for extending that shelf life so we’re trying to be very careful about any PPE that’s being distributed that has any extension and making sure that we’re keeping our healthcare workers safe. I should also add though that we’re running through PPE at a reasonable clip across the state. We’re also acquiring millions of units PPE. Most of what we are acquiring is being shipped out to locations where they’re running through the PPE so I would expect that in many places they’ll be using the PPE that was recently acquired recently manufactured. And we’re going to continue to make those acquisitions, so you’ll be seeing even more PPE but we’ve checked with all of our local health departments and continue to talk to the hospitals and health care centers to make sure that the end nursing homes and other locations where we need PP to make sure that people have what they need. And that we’re supplying them with anything that they may need, especially in the near future. * Governor, people downstate need to hear from you in person. And provided you and your staff can travel safely without becoming ill, when will you be back downstate?… I appreciate the question and I always love to be in downstate Illinois. I was there just a week ago I think, it seems like about a month or two ago, but that’s the way time is moving right now. In Murphysboro, in Springfield, and elsewhere and I am in Carbondale, so I’m going to, I am not reticent to travel. And I certainly will try to find a moment in the near future. I would just remind you, though, that the virus has been so severe in North Eastern Illinois in the in Chicago in the collar counties. I’ve tried to make sure that I’ve been on hand to make decisions here about the thousands and thousands of people that have been affected here, while also looking seriously at the areas of the state like St Clair and Madison counties, like Jackson County Peoria and Champaign where there’s been a rising number of cases. But I’m glad somebody asked and I’m always glad to travel and I will do so and sometime in the near future. * The University of Washington projected the COVID 19 apex in Illinois at April 16, and forecasted 2454 deaths by August. Do those figures and other data in this analysis align with the current state projections?… We have our own statisticians and and modelers that along with the scientists and experts here, we have now taken that University of Washington data and melded in some of the conclusions that they reached, looked at the data sets that they had, and tried to make sure that we’re doing the right thing in terms of our modeling here in Illinois. We’re not concluded, every day there’s new information that goes into these models. But I think that it is fair to say that most of the models that I’ve seen and we’ve seen a number of them show that we’ll be peaking sometime in April in Illinois. And we’re not yet close to that, you know, we have weeks to go. * Is it a foregone conclusion that our medical infrastructure will be vastly overwhelmed in a few weeks? What are you going to do about it?… Oh my goodness. That is my number one concern is to make sure that we don’t have our medical capacity overwhelmed. But I must say when you look at New York, when you look at other places in the country, and you see how fast the beds are filling, the ICU beds, hospitalizations and so on. You can’t help but feel that they have been running as hard as they can to create capacity and to mitigate and put in orders. So, in terms of the mitigation efforts that we put in place, I am pleased that we were able to be early, or at least to do it as quickly as possible. And that has helped us to drop the number of cases that we think will hit the hospitals going forward. But I must tell you that there’s not enough capacity today. That is why you see us building out facilities across the state, that’s why you see us putting in triage centers. We’re building, our national guardsmen and others are putting up tents and other facilities at 10s of dozens of hospitals across the state to make sure that we’re able to keep people separate, that the epidemic doesn’t fly through an emergency room for example. And then we’re building out capacity at some hospitals to just literally add beds in an on to facilities that already exist, and then McCormick Place and the hospitals that we’re looking to turn on in the next couple of weeks. * Question for IDPH Director: If you don’t have adequate testing yet and we’re already roughly halfway through the stay at home order, then how do we measure the rate of transmission? Do we have any evidence to suggest that the spread is slowing?… In addition to testing, we also have the hospital data. Every day, we collect the number of people who are admitted with COVID disease, who have coded like disease, who maybe haven’t had their testing. We’re checking the amount of people with these illnesses that require ICU admission that require the use of a ventilator. And so following those numbers as well, that gives us a track and actual good data in terms of how this is growing and how this is spreading and how our capacity might be reached and how much more we will need. So those data are additional data points that we can use for the modeling that can supplement what we don’t have with widespread testing. -30- …Adding… I should’ve added this. The question for the IDPH Director was: “What information can you tell us about the nine month old who has died? Is it known how the baby contracted the virus, have the parents tested positive? And what is the status of the other infant who tested positive?… The investigation of the infant that we reported about yesterday is still very fresh. We are trying to gather all the data before speaking. I know that there’s a lot of concern as hearing about the death of an infant who also had COVID. And so we really want to get a complete report. Gov. Pritzker also responded… I would remind parents out there that this is highly uncommon. I mean, it really is highly uncommon. That isn’t to say that that every infant is safe, but it just is. It’s so uncommon that, at least when I started to do the work and listen to the experts about it, I got at least some comfort in the idea that this is not something that we should expect to hear a lot more of, because it’s just not happening very often at all. * Some hospitals nationally are continuing to do elective surgeries because they have to worry about their bottom line. How does that fit in with the coronavirus directives in Illinois?… Well, first of all, we, you know, we had to make space for there’s an elective surgery somebody can put off, then we had to ask people to do that. And we realized that it has a financial impact on hospitals. But I have to say, first to the credit of the hospitals, that was not their primary concern when they heard that we were considering it they understood that we needed to do this. And many of them wanted to let us know how quickly they could get to a state where they’re not doing elective surgeries. And so I’m very proud of those institutions and I thank them very much for their willingness. There is a significant financial impact on the hospitals and that’s why the last relief package had a large amount over 100 billion dollars. That was dedicated to hospitals and health centers precisely in part because the impact of COVID 19 on hospitals, has been, I mean, you know, severe, and they’re doing the work anyway they’re they’re doing it and they’re, you know they’re losing money doing everything that they’re doing, but they’re saving people’s lives and I’m so grateful for that we’re gonna work very hard with our federal delegation to help take care of the hospitals that have stepped up.
