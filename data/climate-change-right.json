{"data": [{"text": "Tribalism has become a signature of America within and without since the election of President Trump. The nation has parted ways with international allies, left the rest of the world in their effort to fight the climate change, and most recently the pandemic, by leaving the World Health Organization. Even the pandemic was not a serious issue of importance to our leaders. We did not care much about what was happening in the rest of the world, as opposed to the time of previous pandemics when we were on the ground in those countries helping block the progress so long as it was China's or the European Union's problem. This marks drastic change from previous U.S. altruistic attitude, including during the World War II.  Whether Trump is the cause or effect of the changes in America's collective attitude, an attribute of our current president is his eagerness and ability to use fear for intimidation of those who disagree with him, and subordination and shepherding of those who support him.   Advertisement:  Fear is arguably as old as life. It is deeply ingrained in the living organisms that have survived extinction through billions of years of evolution. Its roots are deep in our core psychological and biological being, and it is one of our most intimate feelings. Danger and war are as old as human history, and so are politics and religion.  I am a psychiatrist and neuroscientist specializing in fear and trauma, and I have some thoughts on how politics, fear and tribalism are intertwined in the current events.  Sheep! Even Dr. Fauci says its not needed. You wear one last year? Flu was higher rate of death. You can put up any stupid political bashing thing you want. it just shows your stupidity. This isn't a left or right thing. Many many left leaning people agree. Move on with life. — Doshier Creations Photography (@tdoshi4) May 28, 2020   Advertisement:  We learn fear from tribe mates  Like other animals, humans can learn fear from experience, such as being attacked by a predator, or witnessing a predator attacking another human. Furthermore, we learn fear by instructions, such as being told there is a predator nearby.  Learning from our tribe mates is an evolutionary advantage that has prevented us from repeating dangerous experiences of other humans. We have a tendency to trust our tribe mates and authorities, especially when it comes to danger. It is adaptive: Parents and wise old men told us not to eat a special plant, or not to go to an area in the woods, or we would be hurt. By trusting them, we would not die like a great-grandfather who died eating that plant. This way, we accumulated knowledge.   Advertisement:  Tribalism has been an inherent part of human history, and is closely linked with fear. There has always been competition between groups of humans in different ways and with different faces, from brutal wartime nationalism to a strong loyalty to a football team. Evidence from cultural neuroscience shows that our brains even respond differently at an unconscious level simply to the view of faces from other races or cultures.  At a tribal level, people are more emotional and consequently less logical: Fans of both teams pray for their team to win, hoping God will take sides in a game. On the other hand, we regress to tribalism when afraid. This is an evolutionary advantage that would lead to the group cohesion and help us fight the other tribes to survive.   Advertisement:  Tribalism is the biological loophole that many politicians have banked on for a long time: tapping into our fears and tribal instincts. Abuse of fear has killed in many faces: extreme nationalism, Nazism, the Ku Klux Klan and religious tribalism have all led to heartless killing of millions.  The typical pattern is to give the other humans a different label than us, perceive them as less than us, who are going to harm us or our resources, and to turn the other group into a concept. It does not have to necessarily be race or nationality. It can be any real or imaginary difference: liberals, conservatives, Middle Easterners, white men, the right, the left, Muslims, Jews, Christians, Sikhs. The list goes on and on.  This attitude is a hallmark of the current president. You could be a Chinese, a Mexican, a Muslim, a Democrat, a liberal, a reporter or a woman. So long as you do not belong to his immediate or larger perceived tribe, he portrays you as subhuman, less worthy, and an enemy.   Advertisement:  Retweeting \"The only good Democrat is a dead Democrat\" is a recent example of how he feeds, and feeds off of such divisive and dehumanizing tribalism.  When building tribal boundaries between \"us\" and \"them,\" politicians have managed very well to create virtual groups of people that do not communicate and hate without even knowing each other: This is the human animal in action!  Fear is uninformed, illogical and often dumb   Advertisement:  Very often my patients with phobias start with: \"I know it is stupid, but I am afraid of spiders.\" Or it may be dogs or cats, or something else. And I always reply: \"It is not stupid, it is illogical.\" We humans have different functions in the brain, and fear oftentimes bypasses logic. In situations of danger, we ought to be fast: First run or kill, then think.  This human tendency is meat to the politicians who want to exploit fear: If you grew up only around people who look like you, only listened to one media outlet and heard from the old uncle that those who look or think differently hate you and are dangerous, the inherent fear and hatred toward those unseen people is an understandable (but flawed) result.  To win us, politicians, sometimes with the media's help, do their best to keep us separated, to keep the real or imaginary \"others\" just a \"concept.\" Because if we spend time with others, talk to them and eat with them, we will learn that they are like us: humans with all the strengths and weaknesses that we possess. Some are strong, some are weak, some are funny, some are dumb, some are nice and some not too nice.  Fear can easily turn violent   Advertisement:  There is a reason that the response to fear is called the \"fight or flight\" response. That response has helped us survive the predators and other tribes that have wanted to kill us. But again, it is another loophole in our biology to be abused. By scaring us, the demagogues turn on our aggression toward \"the others,\" whether in the form of vandalizing their temples, harassing them on the social media, of killing them in cold blood.  When demagogues manage to get hold of our fear circuitry, we often regress to illogical, tribal and aggressive human animals, becoming weapons ourselves – weapons that politicians use for their own agenda.  The irony of evolution is that while those attached to tribal ideologies of racism and nationalism perceive themselves as superior to others, in reality they are acting on a more primitive, less evolved and more animal level.

Introduction  The search for life beyond the Solar System is a significant motivator for the detection and characterization of extrasolar planets around nearby stars. We are poised at the transition between exoplanet detection and demographic studies and the detailed characterization of exoplanet atmospheres and surfaces. Transit and radial velocity surveys have confirmed the existence of thousands of exoplanets (Akeson et al., 2013; Batalha, 2014; Morton et al., 2016) with well over a dozen located within the circumstellar habitable zones (HZs) of their host stars (e.g., Kane et al., 2016). Planets with masses and radii consistent with rocky compositions and likely to contain secondary, volcanically outgassed atmospheres have been found in nearby stellar systems (Berta-Thompson et al., 2015; Wright et al., 2016), some of which reside in the HZ of their host star such as Proxima Centauri b (Anglada-Escudé et al., 2016); TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g (Gillon et al., 2017); and LHS 1140b (Dittmann et al., 2017).  Those planets that transit their stars are excellent candidates for atmospheric characterization through transmission spectroscopy with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) set to launch in 2020 (Deming et al., 2009; Stevenson et al., 2016). Planets with sufficient planet–star separations will likewise be excellent targets for direct-imaging spectroscopy. Space-based telescope missions with the capability of measuring directly imaged spectra of potentially habitable exoplanets are in their science-definition stages (e.g., Dalcanton et al., 2015; Mennesson et al., 2016). Ground-based observers are also devising instrumentation and techniques for current and future observatories that will have the capacity to image Earth-sized planets around nearby stars (Kawahara et al., 2012; Snellen et al., 2013, 2015; Lovis et al., 2016).  The characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres and surfaces in search of remotely detectable biosignatures is a mandate of the NASA Astrobiology Program (Des Marais et al., 2008; Hays et al., 2015; Voytek, 2016). In support of this mandate, and the future observations and missions that will fulfill it, we have compiled an updated review of exoplanet biosignatures. In anticipation of the planned (but later canceled) Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) mission, Des Marais et al. (2002) gave us one of the most comprehensive reviews now available. Our review will emphasize advances in exoplanet biosignature science since the Des Marais et al. (2002) review. These advances have taken many forms, from those demonstrating the detectability of Earth's own biosphere using updated spectral models and data–model comparisons (e.g., Robinson et al., 2011), to the application of photochemical models that test expected changes in concentration of biogenic gases for an Earth-like biosphere around stars with vastly different properties than our own (e.g., Segura et al., 2005). Other advances include evaluations of spectral signatures in the context of plausible biomasses (e.g., Seager et al., 2013a) and metrics for chemical disequilibrium (e.g., Krissansen-Totton et al., 2016a).  It is beyond the scope of this contribution to recapitulate every detail of the aforementioned studies; instead we provide a starting point that exposes readers to general concepts developed in past work. We additionally draw new connections between existing studies and bring forward relevant specialist literature that has not yet been examined in the context of exoplanet biosignatures. Recommendations for future directions are left to the companion articles in this series. This review consists of the following sections: (1) requirements for life, biosignature definitions, and biosignature categories; (2) evaluating planetary habitability; (3) an overview of terrestrial exoplanet modeling studies; (4) gaseous biosignatures, including descriptions of specific gases; (5) surface biosignatures, including description of specific potential reflectance signatures; (6) temporal biosignatures; (7) methods of assessing biosignature plausibility; (8) cryptic biospheres and “false negatives” for life; (9) prospects for detecting exoplanet biosignatures; and (10) a summary of this review.   1.1. Requirements for life  The search for life beyond Earth is one of the most monumental and consequential endeavors on which humanity has ever embarked. It is also a search that is fraught with intricacies and complexities. Our definition of life is necessarily limited by our understanding of life on Earth; however, we are aided by the universality of the laws of physics and chemistry. Through this notion of universality, a consensus has emerged that life requires three essential components: (1) an energy source to drive metabolic reactions, (2) a liquid solvent to mediate these reactions, and (3) a suite of nutrients both to build biomass and to produce enzymes that catalyze metabolic reactions (see Cockell et al., 2016, for an expanded discussion of these requirements).  The study of life on Earth and the general principles of chemistry and physics further suggest, although less strongly, that the liquid solvent is likely to be water, both because of its cosmic abundance (it is one of the most cosmically abundance molecules, consisting of the first [H] and third [O] most abundant elements) and its distinct physicochemical properties that make it highly suitable for mediating macromolecular interactions. While one of water's essential properties is its oft-cited ability to act as a solvent for polar molecules, promoted by its unique ability to engage in hydrogen bonding, water has much more expansive, active and, at times, subtle, roles within known living processes. For example, water plays an essential role in protein folding, protein substrate binding, enzyme actions, the rapid transport of protons in aqueous solution, maintaining the structural stability of proteins and DNA/RNA, and the inhomogeneous segregation of salt ions at cellular interfaces (for a more in-depth discussion, see Ball, 2008, 2013). Carbon chemistry is likewise favored as a basis for biomass because carbon has a high cosmic abundance and carries the ability to form an inordinate number of complex molecules. These last two assumptions are made here provisionally, with the acknowledgment that while alternative biochemistries may exist, their plausibility has not yet been convincingly demonstrated (nor their potential biosignatures explicated). Further constraints on the development and persistence of life likely exist, although they are less precisely enumerable.  The most defining aspect of life is the capacity for evolution, which is necessary to adapt organisms to changing environmental conditions. This requirement to engage in evolutionary adaptation likely requires complex functional molecules that preclude environments too extreme to allow the formation and long-term persistence of such molecules, although this environmental space is yet to be completely circumscribed (see discussion in Des Marais, 2013). The unsettled nature of the definition of life is beyond the scope of this article, and for an expanded discussion of this topic, the reader is referred to Walker et al. (2018, this issue), who provide a more extensive presentation on the definition of life and propose new and diverse conceptual frameworks for expanding the search for life in the Universe.   1.2. Exoplanet biosignature definitions  A biosignature is nominally defined as an “object, substance, and/or pattern whose origin specifically requires a biological agent” (Des Marais and Walter, 1999; Des Marais et al., 2008). A sign of life from an exoplanet may manifest itself as a spectroscopic signal (or signals), a measurement that will have a stated uncertainty and potentially a range of explanations (including measurement error). That signal may be used to infer the presence of a gas or surface feature, which then may be interpreted as originating from a living process. As a matter of definition, we may ask whether the biosignature is the measured spectral signature or the inferred presence of the gas based on that signature. Or, rather, is the biosignature a further inference that a living process must have been involved in the production of the gas or surface feature, perhaps through the collection of additional remotely sensed information? If latter, what level of certainty is required to designate the feature(s) a “biosignature?” In other words, can something be considered a biosignature if there is a nonzero probability that it is not produced by life?  Use of the term “biosignature” in the context of astronomical observations varies widely, but it is mostly commonly understood to be the presence of a gas or other feature that is indicative of a biological agent. In this work, we relax the formal definition of “biosignature” with the understanding that in practice, for almost any conceivable circumstance, a prospective exoplanet biosignature will always be a potential biosignature with other possible explanations (unless technological, but see below). To state this another way, a gas may be a “biosignature gas,” even if the gas may have nonbiological sources. Our challenge then would be to test and ideally prove a biological origin. An alternative position would be that there can be no exoplanet biosignatures, since all hypothetical biosignatures could have false positives (nonbiological origins), and ground truth verification of the biogenicity of any remotely detected signature will be unachievable for the determinable future.  The admission that all proposed exoplanet biosignatures are potential biosignatures in current practice is necessary and inescapable, and protects against false confidence when the full range of abiotic chemistries that may produce false positives is unknown. It is further supported by the experience of researchers studying microfossil evidence for Earth's earliest life-forms, which can often be inconclusive or open to a range of interpretations (e.g., Schopf, 1993; Garcia-Ruiz et al., 2003; Brasier et al., 2015), but nonetheless providing useful information about the evolution of life on our own planet. At the same time, rejection of the potential biosignature concept, as a philosophical choice, may also be unnecessarily pessimistic. Our preference is to find the right balance—that is, to define possibilities and to constrain them with every tool available toward identifying biology as the origin of a putative biosignature, while keeping our minds open to the possibility that such vetting down the road may be beyond technology or scientific understanding available at the time of first observation. An escape from this dilemma would be provided by radio or nonradio “technosignatures”—unambiguous signs of technological civilization explored by practitioners of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI; see, e.g., Tarter, 2001; Cabrol, 2016). While an important and compelling area of study, SETI and technosignatures are beyond the scope of this review, which focuses on signatures of nontechnological life. Here we use the term “biosignature” to refer to nontechnological signs of life unless otherwise noted.   1.3. Biosignature categories  There is currently no universally accepted scheme for classifying the vast array of potential exoplanet biosignatures. For convenience, we group biosignatures into three broad categories following a suggestion by Meadows (2006, 2008): gaseous, surface, and temporal biosignatures (Fig. 1). In this scheme, gaseous biosignatures are direct or indirect products of metabolism, surface biosignatures are spectral features imparted on radiation reflected or scattered by organisms, and temporal biosignatures are modulations in measurable quantities that can be linked to the actions and time-dependent patterns of a biosphere. Gaseous, surface, and temporal biosignatures are reviewed in depth in Sections 4, 5, and 6, respectively. Frameworks for further classifying gaseous signatures are reviewed and proposed in a companion article (Walker et al., 2018).  FIG. 1. Summary of gaseous, surface, and temporal biosignatures. Left panel: gaseous biosignatures are direct or indirect products of biological processes. One example is molecular O 2 generated as a by-product of photosynthesis that is then photochemically processed into O 3 in the stratosphere. Middle panel: surface biosignatures are the spectral signatures imparted by reflected light that interacts directly with living material. One example is the well-known VRE produced by plants and the associated NDVI used for mapping surface vegetation on Earth (Tucker, 1979). Right panel: time-dependent changes in observable quantities, including gas concentrations or surface albedo features, may represent a temporal biosignature if they can be linked to the response of a biosphere to a seasonal or diurnal change. An example is the seasonal oscillation of CO 2 as a response to the seasonal growth and decay of vegetation (e.g., Keeling et al., 1976).

Evaluating Planetary Habitability  The focus of this work is on summarizing proposed exoplanet biosignatures rather than on definitions and metrics for habitability. A full discussion of habitability would require reviewing the complex interplay among instellation, atmospheric dynamics, greenhouse gases, planetary tectonics, orbital stability, ice-albedo feedbacks, the remote detectability of these processes, and many other topics beyond the scope of this review. On the other hand, evaluation of biosignatures must include some discussion of habitability, both because inhabited planets are habitable and because detectable metrics for habitability will assist in the interpretation of potential biosignatures. We adopt the definition that habitable planets are those capable of supporting stable liquid water on the surface. There may be a wide variety of atmospheric compositions that can achieve this result, including N 2 ,- CO 2 ,- and H 2 -dominated atmospheres (Kasting et al., 1993; Pierrehumbert and Gaidos, 2011; Kopparapu et al., 2013; Seager, 2013; Ramirez and Kaltenegger, 2017).  Evaluation of potential habitability is assisted by the concept of the Habitable Zone (HZ), defined as the range of distances, or annulus, around a star that would allow a planet with a given atmosphere to maintain surface liquid water (Fig. 2). This definition allows for a rapid assessment of potential habitability if observables such as semimajor axis and stellar luminosity can be adequately constrained. (Stellar luminosity may be directly measured or estimated from other measured stellar parameters such as effective temperature and radius, although there are notable large errors for the latter that may be propagated into HZ estimates, see Kane, 2014.) The most common definition of the HZ assumes an N 2 -CO 2 -H 2 O atmosphere with a carbonate–silicate feedback cycle (Walker et al., 1981; Kasting et al., 1993; Kopparapu et al., 2013) that acts as a planetary thermostat, as it is believed to do on Earth. In this conception of the HZ, planetary temperature is primarily controlled by greenhouse absorption via CO 2 and H 2 O, and the overall planetary albedo—a product of atmospheric mass and composition, cloud cover and composition, surface albedo, and stellar temperature.  FIG. 2. The circumstellar habitable zone. Planets within the Habitable Zone have the capacity to maintain stable surface liquid water assuming an N 2 -CO 2 -H 2 O atmosphere and a carbonate–silicate feedback cycle (e.g., Kasting et al., 1993; Kopparapu et al., 2013). The assumption of surface liquid water is important because it suggests a biosphere, if present, would be in direct contact with the atmosphere, allowing the buildup of potentially detectable biosignatures in the atmosphere and/or on the surface.  The boundaries of the HZ in terms of stellar instellation will vary as a function of stellar type as the spectral energy distribution of stars of different temperatures will produce different effective planetary albedos even for a planetary atmosphere of constant composition (e.g., less or more blue light to Rayleigh scatter, and radiation shifted into or out of primary gas absorption bands). It is important to note that even this definition of the HZ depends on factors such as planetary gravity and atmospheric mass, which can alter the greenhouse effect due to pressure broadening effects (Kopparapu et al., 2014), and ice cover and surface composition (Shields et al., 2013, 2014). Other definitions of the HZ are much broader (e.g., Seager, 2013) and include H 2 -dominated atmospheres where H 2 -H 2 collisionally induced absorption greatly extends the outer edge of the HZ (Pierrehumbert and Gaidos, 2011), possibly to interstellar space (Stevenson, 1999), and dry atmospheres that press the inner edge of the HZ closer to the star (Abe et al., 2011; Zsom et al., 2013). Until recently, most assessments of the HZ have been made with relatively simple one-dimenstional (1D) radiative–convective models. Newer work using more advanced three-dimensional (3D) general circulation models (GCMs), however, suggests more optimistic limits at the inner edge of the HZ (Yang et al., 2013, 2014; Leconte et al., 2013a, 2013b; Kopparapu et al., 2016; Shields et al., 2016b) while also showing perhaps more pessimistic results for the outer edge compared with 1D results (Wolf, 2017).  An additional challenge at the outer edge of the HZ is presented by “limit cycles”—oscillations between globally glaciated and climatically warm states resulting from the balance of warming from CO 2 outgassing and cooling from CO 2 subduction over the carbonate–silicate cycle and consequent changes in albedo from planetary glaciation and deglaciation (Tajika, 2007; Kadoya and Tajika, 2014; Menou, 2015; Haqq-Misra et al., 2016; Paradise and Menou, 2017). Limit cycles have been investigated by a hierarchy of climate models, including simple energy balance models, 1D radiative–convective models, and 3D GCMs. Transiently habitable states at the outer edge of the HZ due to limit cycles may preclude complex or even simple life depending on the duration of warm and cool states. The occurrence of limit cycles will depend on planetary parameters such as the CO 2 outgassing rate, the incident stellar flux, and the spectral energy distribution of the host star, with planets orbiting F stars most susceptible to them (Haqq-Misra et al., 2016). For the purposes of target selection for biosignature searches, conservative definitions of the HZ may be preferred to maximize the probability of success (Kasting et al., 2013), and thus, a preference for targets within the most restrictive HZ limits of 1D and 3D modeling results could be adopted, including consideration of limit cycles. In any case, a habitable planet must at minimum possess liquid water and one (or more) noncondensable greenhouse gases sufficient to warm the surface. The presence of a planet within the HZ is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for habitability by this definition.  Host star type (or effective temperature) must also be considered when evaluating the potential habitability of planets. While radiative–convective or more advanced GCMs may suggest that a given insolation is appropriate for maintaining surface liquid water, other factors that impact planetary habitability are influenced strongly by stellar mass. The most common consideration in this realm is stellar lifetime, with the common assumption that remotely detectable Earth-like biospheres require hundreds of millions to billions of years to develop. If the stellar lifetime is shorter than this time frame, few if any planets orbiting those stars will have had the requisite time to develop biosignatures. This requirement excludes main sequence stars more luminous than spectral type F or a stellar mass of ∼1.4 M sol .  At the low end of the mass range (0.075–0.5 M sol ), M stars represent the most common and long-lived type of star in the galaxy, but also possess properties that pose obstacles to habitability. These include the deleterious impacts of the ultraviolet (UV) and particle (flare) activity of these stars (Segura et al., 2003; Lammer et al., 2007; Davenport et al., 2016; Ribas et al., 2016; Airapetian et al., 2017), their premain sequence evolution (Ramirez and Kaltenegger, 2014; Luger and Barnes, 2015; Tian, 2015), and the impact of tidal heating on planetary climate (Barnes et al., 2009; Driscoll and Barnes, 2015; Bolmont and Mathis, 2016; Bolmont et al., 2017). In addition, the low quiescent (nonflaring) near-ultraviolet (NUV) spectrum of M dwarfs may also drastically limit the rate of prebiotic photoprocesses, creating an obstacle for the origin of life on these worlds (Ranjan et al., 2017). Despite these concerns, a provisional consensus holds that M dwarf stars may indeed possess potentially habitable planets (Tarter et al., 2007; Scalo et al., 2007; see Shields et al., 2016a, for a recent, thorough review of the habitability of planets around M stars). Here we consider planets orbiting within the HZ of FGKM stars as potential targets for habitability assessment and biosignature searches.  Confirming habitability requires further investigation beyond simply determining whether a planet lies within the HZ of its star. The most straightforward determination of planetary habitability would be direct detection of surface liquid water, possibly through the observation of glint if the planet can be observed at large phase angles (e.g., Williams and Gaidos, 2008, Robinson et al., 2010, Zugger et al., 2010; Robinson et al., 2014, but see also Cowan et al., 2012). Ocean–land heterogeneity and rotation rate could also be detected through time-dependent spectrophotometric analysis (Ford et al., 2001; Cowan et al., 2009; Kawahara and Fujii, 2010, 2011; Fujii et al., 2011; Cowan and Strait, 2013), which may also provide indirect evidence for other consequences of continentality, including terrestrial habitats, plate tectonics, and attendant nutrient cycling. Alternatively, the stability of liquid water could be determined indirectly by constraining planetary temperature through midinfrared (MIR) observations (e.g., Robinson et al., 2011) and pressure by retrievals based on the Rayleigh scattering slope (Benneke and Seager, 2012) or through highly density-dependent collisional or dimer absorption features of primary atmospheric constituents such as N 2 or oxygen (O 2 ) (Pallé et al., 2009; Misra et al., 2014a; Schwieterman et al., 2015b). A planet with the appropriate temperature and pressure, in addition to the presence of H 2 O absorption bands, is likely to be a habitable world (Des Marais et al., 2002). Robinson (2017) provides a current review of habitability detection.  Conceptually, we can place potential exoplanet spectral habitability markers into the same broad categories as exoplanet biosignatures: gaseous, surface, and temporal. Water vapor and carbon dioxide gas would be examples of gaseous signatures (Fig. 3), ocean–continent heterogeneity and glint would be examples of surface signatures (although requiring a time component to the observation), while variable cloud cover and transient volcanic gases or aerosols are examples of temporal signatures of atmospheric properties that may be linked to habitability (e.g., Kaltenegger et al., 2010; Misra et al., 2015). We leave focused and explicit exploration of habitability assessment and its relation to biosignature evaluation for the companion article in this issue by Catling et al. (2018; see especially their reference Tables 3 and 4). However, we continue to reference habitability markers here as they directly relate to biosignatures, such as in the case of spectral overlap of notable bands or feedback connections between habitability markers and biosignature gases in the atmosphere. We note that biosignatures must be examined in the context of effects and “background noise” due to putative habitability signatures (such as in the case of spectral overlap between, e.g., H 2 O and methane [CH 4 ]).  FIG. 3. Exoplanet habitability markers [H 2 O + CO 2 + (N 2 ) 2 ]. Left: spectral line intensities for H 2 O and CO 2 from the HITRAN 2012 line-by-line database (Rothman et al., 2013). Right: temperature-dependent N 2 -N 2 binary (collisional) absorption coefficients from a formulation by Lafferty et al. (1996), after a plot from Schwieterman et al. (2015b).  3. Overview of Terrestrial Exoplanet Modeling Studies  Because many potential biosignatures have been identified through models that variously treat the planetary atmospheric, biogeochemical, and physical systems, it is appropriate that we provide a short introduction to such modeling tools and studies. These strategies include data–model comparisons, photochemical models, spectral models, and studies of Earth's evolution. Such system-level approaches serve as frameworks and provide foundational concepts for discussions relating to exoplanet biosignatures.   3.1. Observations of Earth  As Earth currently offers our only example of an inhabited planet, observations of Earth have been analyzed for the detectability of biosignatures, and these data have then served to evaluate spectral models that simulate Earth radiance spectra for a variety of viewing geometries and cloud conditions. Two primary observing modes have provided data: (1) measurements of Earthshine reflected from the Moon (Arnold et al., 2002; Woolf et al., 2002; Montanes‐Rodriguez et al., 2005, 2006; Seager et al., 2005; Hamdani et al., 2006; Turnbull et al., 2006; Arnold, 2008; Pallé et al., 2009; Sterzik et al., 2012) and (2) photometric and spectrophotometric observations of Earth by interplanetary spacecraft (Sagan et al., 1993; Livengood et al., 2011; Robinson et al., 2011, 2014; Hurley et al., 2014; Schwieterman et al., 2015b). It is clear from these studies that habitability markers (H 2 O, CO 2 , N 2 , and ocean glint, as described in the previous section), some biosignature gases (O 2 , ozone [O 3 ]), and the vegetation red edge (VRE) surface biosignature can be detected in Earth's disk-averaged spectrum (these biosignatures are described in detail in sections 4 and 5 below). Heterogeneous features such as vegetation are more easily studied with significant spatial resolution (e.g., Sagan et al., 1993) or at opportune phases that maximize the viewable planetary surface through clear sky paths.  The first observations of potentially habitable exoplanets will likely be limited to disk-averaged photometry and spectra such that only those biosignatures with a global, planetary impact will be detectable. However, time-resolved photometry techniques have the potential to quantify heterogeneity of surface cover fractions on rapidly rotation planets (Ford et al., 2001; Fujii et al., 2010; Kawahara and Fujii, 2010; Fujii and Kawahara, 2012; Cowan and Strait, 2013). Biosignatures will have varying levels of detectability with different observing modes (e.g., direct-imaging vs. transmission spectroscopy).   3.2. Spectral models  Radiative transfer models allow us to calculate the scattering and absorption of radiation through a medium such as an atmosphere, a body of water, or even a plant canopy. Such models are used to generate synthetic spectra of exoplanets, and are essential for estimating the remote detectability of biosignature gases or surface features. The type of radiative transfer model will vary depending on the planned observing mode to be simulated. Synthetic direct-imaging models simulate the reflected and emitted light from a planetary body. The reflected light includes incident stellar radiation that is scattered (or specularly reflected) to the observer by the planet's atmosphere or its surface. Emitted light is the thermal radiation from the planet. Transmission spectroscopy models simulate the spectrum of light that has passed through the atmosphere of a transiting exoplanet. Typically, high-resolution spectra require line-by-line approaches—for example, the Spectral Mapping Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SMART) Model (Meadows and Crisp, 1996; Crisp, 1997) or the Generic Atmospheric Radiation Line-by-line Infrared Code (GARLIC) (Schreier et al., 2014). In general, a line list database such as HITRAN (Rothman et al., 2013), HITEMP (Rothman et al., 2010), or ExoMol (Tennyson and Yurchenko, 2012) is used to query line parameters for gases included in the model and calculate absorption cross sections.  Separate modules of the radiative transfer model must calculate Rayleigh and aerosol scattering. Aerosol parameters (e.g., particle size distributions, densities, and altitudes) must also be specified if haze or cloud cover is assumed. Surface spectral albedos constitute the lower boundary conditions in the spectral model and can be assumed to be Lambertian or the entire bidirectional reflectance distribution function can be specified. Spectral models are necessary for our understanding of exoplanet biosignatures because they must be used to determine whether a proposed biosignature gas, surface feature, or temporal modulation produces a sufficient impact to be detectable.  As an example of a spectral model of Earth validated through observations, Fig. 4 shows a simulated ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared, and mid-infrared (UV-VIS-NIR-MIR) spectrum of Earth from the well-validated Virtual Planetary Laboratory (VPL) 3D spectral Earth model (Robinson et al., 2011). This model includes gaseous absorption, Rayleigh scattering, the modern Earth's actual continental and surface distribution, and realistic cloud cover. The model validation included the following: (1) data–model comparisons with visible spectrophotometric measurements and NIR spectroscopy by the EPOXI mission (Livengood et al., 2011; Robinson et al., 2011; Schwieterman et al., 2015b), (2) MIR data–model comparisons with measurements from the Aqua Earth observing satellite, and (3) VIS-NIR spectra taken by the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) mission (Robinson et al., 2014). Biosignature gas absorption features are present, including those of O 3 , O 2 , and CH 4 . The VRE is included as well as water vapor absorption.  FIG. 4. A synthetic UVOIR Earth radiance spectrum at quadrature phase (half illumination). The top panel (0.2 μm < λ < 2.0 μm) is shown in terms of geometric albedo, while the bottom two panels (2 μm < λ < 5 μm; 5 μm < λ < 22 μm) are presented in spectral radiance units (W · m−2·μm−1·sr−1). This spectrum was generated by the VPL 3D spectral Earth model (Robinson et al., 2011; Schwieterman et al., 2015b). Strong absorption features from O 2 , O 3 , H 2 O, CO 2 , N 2 O, and CH 4 are labeled, in addition to Rayleigh scattering and the location of the VRE. 3D, three-dimensional; CH 4 , methane; N 2 O, nitrous oxide; UVOIR, ultraviolet-optical-infrared; VPL, Virtual Planetary Laboratory; VRE, vegetation red edge.  Data–model comparisons have the capacity to validate the detectability of biosignature features through forward modeling (e.g., Des Marais et al., 2002), providing these signatures exist on the modern Earth and their presence is in some way imprinted onto our planet's spectrum. Once validated, those same models can then be altered to simulate planetary spectra for different viewing geometries, cloud conditions, and alternative atmospheric compositions and surface features—in other words, for a wide array of planetary conditions. Through this approach, we can surmise the detectability of biosignatures, including biosignatures proposed for planets such as early Earth (Section 3.4), planets orbiting different stars, or biospheres under different environmental conditions. Sections 4, 5, and 6 describe in more detail studies of individual gaseous, surface, and temporal biosignatures, respectively, many of which use Earth model validations to confirm that spectral models can accurately represent the impact of a proposed biosignature on a planetary spectrum.  3.3. Photochemical studies of terrestrial atmospheres  Photochemical models simulate the interaction of a host star's radiation with a planetary atmosphere. These models use an abbreviated selection of chemical species and reactions to approximate the chemical composition of planetary atmospheres, which may then serve as input for spectral models. The list of species can include both gas-phase and aerosol-phase molecules. These models also track radiative transfer through the atmosphere, focusing on the UV to visible part of the spectrum, as photons in that wavelength range drive most photolysis reactions.  Generally, photochemical models calculate the rate of each reaction in the model (including but not limited to photolysis reactions) as well as physical mixing between model grid points and depositional mass fluxes. This combination allows the creation of a set of equations for the production and loss of each species in each layer of the model atmosphere. Together, these equations define a set of coupled differential equations that are passed to a numerical solver used to find a self-consistent solution for the atmospheric state based on the list of chemical species, their reactions, the stellar irradiation, and the assumed boundary conditions for the model grid.  The main boundary conditions for these models are as follows: (1) the mass fluxes into or out of the atmosphere (usually into the atmosphere at the surface–atmosphere interface, along with a limited flow of light species such as H out of the top of the atmosphere) and (2) the spectral energy flux into the top of the atmosphere, according to the star and the star–planet separation. These boundary conditions can fundamentally alter the composition of the atmosphere. Depending on the purpose and complexity of the photochemical model, it may ultimately calculate a steady-state atmospheric composition that is stable over geological timescales. Alternatively, some photochemical modeling efforts have focused on characterizing the atmospheric consequences of short-duration events, such as stellar flares, by using the same numerical tools.  There are several well-established photochemical models developed by different research groups over the last few decades. The model of the Kasting group (e.g., Kasting, 1982, 1997; Pavlov and Kasting, 2002; Domagal-Goldman et al., 2011) and versions developed therefrom (e.g., Segura et al., 2003, 2007, 2010; Rauer et al., 2011; Arney et al., 2016), the Caltech/JPL model (e.g., Allen et al., 1981; Nair et al., 1994; Yung et al., 1988; Gao et al., 2015), and the Hu group model (Hu et al., 2012, 2013; Hu and Seager, 2014) all share the same general approach to simulating photochemistry. As mentioned earlier, these models include atmospheric chemical reaction lists for the major and minor species and represent a set of partial differential equations governing the concentrations of those species. The models use these equations to evolve gas concentrations toward steady state. Boundary conditions, as mentioned previously, include the impact of planetary processes (e.g., volcanism) on the atmosphere.  Photochemical models have been used in a variety of contexts. They have a long history of modern Earth applications, from modeling the O 3 hole and the evolution of greenhouse gas concentrations, to understanding the fate of trace pollutants. In planetary science, these models are often used to interpret data from spacecraft observations, or to simulate data returns from future missions. They also have been used to help understand the atmospheres of early Earth and early Mars by delineating atmospheric states that are consistent with geological and geochemical data.  For exoplanets, photochemical models have been used to simulate potential chemical compositions of a wide variety of worlds, to either interpret observed transit spectroscopy data or to simulate future spectral data, including spectral biosignatures. If spectral simulations are desired, the outputs of a photochemical model are used as inputs to a more detailed radiative transfer model that generates the spectrum. Photochemical models are especially useful for helping understand the contextual information required to interpret a biosignature. Examples of such studies include investigations of the potential atmospheric composition of the Archean Earth (Kasting, 2001; Kharecha et al., 2005; Kaltenegger et al., 2007), of planets orbiting M dwarf stars that have low UV flux (e.g., Segura et al., 2005), of possible by-products of biogenic gases that could serve as biosignatures (e.g., Domagal-Goldman et al., 2011), and of the possibility of false positives from abiotic generation of biosignature gases in alternative planetary environments (see Section 4).  Caution should be taken when interpreting the results of a photochemical model that simulates an atmosphere without the aid of observational constraints. These simulations represent a plausible and sustainable atmospheric state, not necessarily its current chemical composition. A planet could have multiple stable states, given a single set of boundary conditions. Conversely, it is possible for different sets of boundary conditions to reproduce the same stable state. Changing the boundary conditions in the model may result in different sets of possible states. These plausible photochemical model solutions are useful for assessing which of these states may contain detectable biosignatures, as well as to motivate research to constrain better the modeled processes. A prime example is in ongoing research to explain the suite of Earth's different geochemical states through time.   3.4. Earth through time  Life and environment have coevolved on Earth for billions of years. The most significant biologically mediated change was the oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere due to the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis (OP); in turn, high levels of O 2 at Earth's surface eventually allowed the emergence and proliferation of complex, animal life. Evidence for atmospheric O 2 first appeared in the rock record ∼2.3 billion years ago (Gyr; e.g., Luo et al., 2016) during a relatively short interval of time referred to as the “Great Oxidation Event” (GOE) (e.g., Holland, 2002) (Fig. 5). Another series of shifts in atmospheric O 2 occurred during the late Proterozoic and the early Phanerozoic (∼750 to 460 million years ago). Each geological eon comprises a suite of differences not only in the oxidation state of the atmosphere but also in the composition of the biosphere. Thus, each provides a potential template/analogue for the spectral character of a biogeochemical state of a rocky terrestrial planet in the HZ of its star.  FIG. 5. Evolution of Earth's atmospheric O 2 content through time. Shaded boxes show approximate ranges based on the latest geochemical proxy records, while the curve shows one possible evolutionary trend over time. After Reinhard et al. (2017); see also Lyons et al. (2014).  Nuanced interpretation of potential observations of “Alternative Earth” analogues must also consider the uncertainty and possible lack of detectability of the life-forms that may be only just emerging or that abound but in ways that insufficiently impact the atmosphere. For example, the date of the earliest emergence of O 2 -evolving photosynthetic cyanobacteria is highly uncertain. O 2 may have been produced by cyanobacteria in the late Archean, but at a rate that could not yet produce a strong atmospheric signal (Lyons et al., 2014); indeed, before the GOE, atmospheric “whiffs” of O 2 , and localized O 2 oases in the shallow ocean are inferred from the trace element and isotope records (Planavsky et al., 2014a). Such traces of life would likely elude detection. (The mechanisms for O 2 buildup and further details surrounding the trajectory of the O 2 content of Earth's atmosphere are described in Section 4.2.1.)  Various modeling studies have attempted to model Earth's atmospheric composition and spectral signatures and their variation over time self-consistently by using coupled photochemical/radiative–convective models and prescribed surface fluxes of various gases or prescribed surface spectral albedos. Relevant examples include models exploring different geologic eons on Earth (Meadows, 2006; Kaltenegger et al., 2007); an early Earth with photosynthetic microbial mats on land (Sanromá et al., 2013), a purple Archean ocean due to photosynthetic purple bacteria (Sanromá et al., 2014); an orange Archean Earth due to an organic-rich atmospheric haze (Arney et al., 2016); and trajectories of O 2 fluxes over geologic time given estimated atmospheric concentrations (Gebauer et al., 2017). Such approaches have also been applied to planets orbiting other stars: for example, biosignature gas concentrations and detectability under the UV environments of planets orbiting M stars (Segura et al., 2005; Rugheimer et al., 2015a, 2015b); and organic hazes on Earth-like planets around different stellar types (Arney et al., 2017). The sections that follow describe these biosignature examples and others in detail, with many investigations in the context of photochemical models of alternative planetary scenarios.   4. Gaseous Biosignatures  Gaseous biosignatures can result from direct biological production or from environmental processing of biogenic products leading to secondary compounds. The example treated in detail in the companion article by Meadows et al. (2018) is O 2 produced from photosynthesis, and O 3 subsequently formed by photochemical reactions involving O 2 in the stratosphere. Not all biogenic gases are uniquely biological, and their identification as signs of life will depend strongly on their environmental context. Below we describe biogenic gases known to date, the contexts in which they may or may not be identified as biosignatures, their spectral absorbance features, and how they may be observed.   4.1. Gaseous biosignature overview  To be spectrally detectable, gases in the atmosphere must interact with photons through dissociation, electronic, or vibrorotational transitions. Because many gases absorb near the same wavelengths, it is essential to have the spectral range and/or resolution to discriminate between gases to uniquely identify their presence or absence in an exoplanet atmosphere. Figure 6 shows the line absorption intensities or absorption cross sections for the biosignature gases presented in this section for reference, drawing from the HITRAN 2012 (Rothman et al., 2013) and PNNL (Sharpe et al., 2004) spectral databases. These gases include O 2 , O 3 , nitrous oxide (N 2 O), CH 4 , methyl chloride (CH 3 Cl), ethane (C 2 H 6 ), NH 3 , dimethyl sulfide (DMS), dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), and methanethiol (CH 3 SH) (also see reference Tables 3 and 4 in Catling et al., 2018, a companion article in this journal issue).  FIG. 6. Biosignature gas absorption features. Line intensities (cm−1/[molecule cm−2]) for O 2 , O 3 , N 2 O, CH 4 , CH 3 Cl, C 2 H 6 , and NH 3 are sourced from HITRAN 2012 (Rothman et al., 2013), while cross sections (cm2) for DMS, DMDS, and CH 3 SH are sourced from the PNNL spectral database (Sharpe et al., 2004). C 2 H 6 , ethane; CH 3 Cl, methyl chloride; CH 3 SH, methanethiol; DMDS, dimethyl disulfide; DMS, dimethyl sulfide.   4.2. Earth-like atmospheres  An “Earth-like” atmosphere is defined here as one dominated by N 2 , CO 2 , and H 2 O (O 2 may or may not be a significant component). An “Earth-like” atmosphere is, by definition, associated with habitability and characterized by the presence of high-molecular-weight gases (μ M >> 2) that include a condensable greenhouse gas (H 2 O), a noncondensable greenhouse gas (CO 2 ), and a noncondensable background gas (N 2 ). This definition is traditionally used to define the circumstellar HZ with 1D radiative–convective climate models (Kopparapu et al., 2013). Earth's atmospheric composition has evolved greatly through time (section 3.4), and so, it is important not to limit the definition of “Earth-like” to atmospheres identical to Earth's modern atmosphere, which represents just a small part of Earth history (e.g., Lyons et al., 2014). Furthermore, an Earth-like atmosphere is not the only type of “habitable” atmosphere conceivable for a rocky, terrestrial planet. Alternative possibilities, such as an H 2 -dominated atmosphere, are described in Section 4.4.  Each subsection below describes a biosignature gas that has been considered for Earth-like atmospheres (high molecular weight, N 2 -CO 2 -H 2 O dominated). First, the major biological production and buildup mechanisms for the gas are described. Second, abiotic sources are presented and discussed if known. If the buildup of the gas has been studied as a function of the host star spectral type, this is also discussed. Each subsection concludes with a description of the major absorption bands of each gas, and whether they overlap with those from other gaseous biosignatures.  4.2.1. Oxygen (O 2 )  Molecular O 2 and its photochemical by-product O 3 have been the most highly referenced astronomical biosignature gases since surveys of nearby habitable planets have been contemplated (e.g., Owen, 1980; Leger et al., 1993; Sagan et al., 1993; Des Marais et al., 2002). This is largely because O 2 is a dominant gas in Earth's modern atmosphere (pO 2 = 0.21), produces potentially detectable spectral signatures, and is effectively entirely sourced from photosynthesis on Earth. Oxygenic photosynthesis (OP) uses light energy to (indirectly) split H 2 O, which serves as an electron donor to produce organic matter from CO 2 , generating O 2 as a waste product (Leslie, 2009). The net reaction is often written as follows:  where (CH 2 O) org represents organic matter and hν is the energy of the photon(s) (where h is Planck's constant and ν is the frequency of the photon). Although the net equation may cancel an H 2 O from both sides, this representation explicitly shows that the O 2 atoms for the evolved O 2 (denoted with superscript w) come from the water molecules and not the carbon dioxide. OP makes use of some of the most widely available molecules in the ocean–atmosphere system (H 2 O and CO 2 ) and harnesses abundant photons from the Sun. It is regarded as perhaps the most potentially productive metabolism on any planet orbiting a star due to the wide availability of its basic substrate and energy source (Kiang et al., 2007a, 2007b). The range of organisms that use OP on our own planet includes plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. It is important to note that oxygenation of an atmosphere is a more complex process than simple production of O 2 by photosynthetic organisms. The net photosynthetic reaction given above is, in a general sense, reversible, depleting O 2 with the decay of organic matter via aerobic respiration (CH 2 O + O 2 → CO 2 + H 2 O). Photosynthesis produces no net O 2 unless some of the organic matter is preserved and ultimately sequestered from the atmosphere. This process is primarily facilitated by burial of organic matter in marine sediments or soils (Berner and Canfield, 1989; Bergman, 2004; Catling, 2014), and is also greatly augmented by burial of sulfide generated by anaerobic sulfate reducers that oxidize organic matter (Berner and Raiswell, 1983). The accumulation of O 2 in the atmosphere further requires that the rate of these burial processes is greater than the rate of O 2 losses, such as by reactions with reduced volcanic gases (Catling, 2014).  The history of Earth's O 2 levels has many nuances, but there is a broad consensus on the major phases (e.g., Lyons et al., 2014). In the Archean eon (4.0–2.5 Ga), O 2 levels were very low (pO 2 < 10−7), while CH 4 levels were believed to be elevated (100–1000 ppm). The GOE occurred ca. 2.4 Ga, near the beginning of the Proterozoic eon, and marked a significant change in the chemistry of the atmosphere, increasing pO 2 by several orders of magnitude and decreasing the prevalence of reduced gases such as CH 4 . After the GOE pO 2 rose to as high as 1–10% of modern levels (Kump, 2008), although recent evidence suggests pO 2 remained low relative to modern levels for most of the Proterozoic eon (pO 2 < 0.1%) (Planavsky et al., 2014b), it was only after a second series of O 2 shifts during the late Proterozoic (∼800 million years ago, Ma) and the Paleozoic (∼420 Ma) when pO 2 approached modern levels. The late Proterozoic shift occurred roughly contemporaneously with the rise and diversification of complex animal life (Reinhard et al., 2016). Importantly, the initial rise of O 2 levels on Earth was delayed until well after the evolution of OP, which had likely occurred by 3.0 Ga (Buick, 2008; Planavsky et al., 2014a)—if not earlier. In any case, understanding the protracted rise of O 2 in Earth's atmosphere is an active area of investigation, with critical implications for biosignature evolution on extrasolar planets.  Molecular O 2 has a few strong bands in the VIS/NIR region, including the O 2 -A band (0.76 μm), the O 2 -B band (0.69 μm), and the O 2 -g band (0.63 μm). In addition, O 2 collisionally induced absorption (O 2 -O 2 ) occurs at 1.06 μm, and the 1.27 μm O 2 band includes contributions both from monomer O 2 (a1Δ g band) and dimer O 2 -O 2 collisional absorption. At very high O 2 concentrations, O 2 -O 2 CIA (also referred to as O 4 ) absorption occurs at 0.445, 0.475, 0.53, 0.57, and 0.63 μm (Hermans et al., 1999; Richard et al., 2012; Schwieterman et al., 2016). In the MIR, O 2 has an absorption band at 6.4 μm, but this band is weak and overlaps with much stronger H 2 O absorption, so is unlikely to be observable at low resolution for habitable planets. In the UV, O 2 has strong absorption from photodissociation at wavelengths shorter than 0.2 μm, although this is also true for several other gases, such as CO 2 . Of these, the O 2 -A band (0.76 μm) is by far the most preferable target band for direct imaging (reflected light observations) due to its relative strength and the lack of overlap with features from other common gases.  On Earth, the production of abiotic O 2 from the photolysis of other O-bearing molecules occurs at a very slow rate. This O 2 would not build up to appreciable levels due to the distribution of UV energy from the Sun (which controls the rate of O 2 production from O-bearing species such as CO 2 and its destruction rate) and geochemical sinks for O 2 (e.g., Domagal-Goldman et al., 2014; Harman et al., 2015). However, several scenarios have been described that could allow for the buildup of abiotic O 2 for planets orbiting other types of stars. Potential “false positives” for abiotic O 2 are reviewed briefly in Section 4.3 and more extensively in Meadows (2017) and Meadows et al. (2018).  4.2.2. Ozone (O 3 )  The O 3 in Earth's stratosphere is the result of photochemical reactions that split O 2 . The detection of significant O 3 in a planetary atmosphere has been proposed as a proxy for photosynthetically generated O 2 (Léger et al., 1993, 2011; Des Marais et al., 2002), with the advantage that O 3 absorbs strongly in complementary wavelength bands to O 2 (e.g., in the UV and MIR). The formation and destruction cycle of O 3 is described by the Chapman scheme (Chapman, 1930):  where λ is the minimum wavelength for photodissociation of the given molecule and M is any molecule that can carry away excess vibrational energy (e.g., N 2 ). The O 3 layer on Earth reaches peak concentrations of up to 10 ppm in the stratosphere between 15 and 30 km in altitude, but both the value and altitude of the peak O 3 concentration vary spatially. The incident UV photon flux and spectrum impact the rate of O 3 production and destruction, thus affecting the predicted O 3 concentration and profile for planets orbiting different stars even if the planetary O 2 abundance is the same (Segura et al., 2003; Rugheimer et al., 2013; Grenfell et al., 2014). Indeed, planets with the same O 2 abundances, orbiting the same star, but at different distances, will have slightly different O 3 profiles mainly due to differences in UV and temperature structure (Grenfell et al., 2007). Furthermore, particle fluxes from flares around active stars have the capacity to strongly attenuate the predicted O 3 column, depending on the strength and frequency of the flare events (Segura et al., 2010; Tabataba-Vakili et al., 2016). Like O 2 , O 3 may be produced through abiotic photochemical mechanisms, with current literature studies indicating that abiotic production is favored most around M dwarf and F dwarf stars (Domagal-Goldman et al., 2014; Harman et al., 2015). This relationship is further discussed in Section 4.4.  O 3 possesses absorption features in the UV-VIS-NIR-MIR regions of the spectrum. In the UV, the Hartley–Huggins bands are centered at 0.25 μm and extend from 0.35 to 0.15 μm. These bands are saturated in Earth's spectrum, but caution is warranted since other molecules such as sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) also absorb in this wavelength region (Robinson et al., 2014). In the visible, the Chappuis bands extend from 0.5 to 0.7 μm and contribute to the “U” shape of Earth's overall UV-VIS-NIR spectrum, a feature that distinguishes Earth's color from those of other planets at even very low (Δλ ∼0.1 μm) spectral resolution (Krissansen-Totton et al., 2016b). O 3 has several weak bands in the NIR at 2.05, 2.15, 2.5, 3.3, 3.6, 4.6, and 4.8 μm. Those at the longer wavelengths are the strongest, although many of these bands overlap with absorption features from H 2 O and CO 2 . In reflected light, the UV band is the strongest feature from O 3 . O 3 also imprints strong features on the emitted, thermal infrared portion of Earth's spectrum. The strongest and most well studied of these is the 9.65 μm band, which occurs in the middle of Earth's thermal infrared spectral window (Des Marais et al., 2002). The 9.65 μm band would be a prime target for an infrared-capable telescope, such as the previously envisioned Terrestrial Planet Finder–Infrared mission (TPF-I) (Beichman et al., 2006; Lawson et al., 2006; Traub et al., 2007) or its ESA equivalent Darwin (Cockell et al., 2009b). Caution should be given to the overlap from the “doubly hot” band of CO 2 at 9.4 μm, which would also produce absorption at 10.5 μm (Segura et al., 2007, see their Fig. 5b). In addition, other gases, including CH 3 Cl, DMS, DMDS, and CH 3 SH, have overlapping absorption features near the 9.65 μm band (Pilcher, 2003, see sections 4.2.5 and 4.2.6 below). Therefore, it is essential to obtain spectral information at other wavelengths to confidently detect O 3 . Finally, there is a weak O 3 band at 14.08 μm, which is completely swamped by the 15 μm CO 2 band. To summarize, the best prospects for detecting O 3 are the Hartley–Huggins bands centered at 0.25 μm in the UV, the subtler Chappuis band extending from 0.5 to 0.7 μm in the visible, and the 9.65 μm band in the MIR.  4.2.3. Methane (CH 4 )  Methanogenesis is an ancient form of anaerobic microbial metabolism that produces CH 4 as a waste product, most commonly by either respiring CO 2 as a terminal electron acceptor or disproportionating acetate to CH 4 and CO 2 . These reactions can be written as follows:  where H 2 is hydrogen gas and CH 3 COOH is acetic acid—a decay product from fermentation of organic matter. On Earth, the single-celled organisms responsible for methanogenesis, called “methanogens,” are restricted to the domain Archaea. Methanogenesis is the dominant source of nonanthropogenic CH 4 in Earth's modern atmosphere, and CH 4 has consequently been suggested as a potential biosignature on Earth (e.g., Sagan et al., 1993) and on Mars (e.g., Krasnopolsky et al., 2004). However, there are many potential abiotic CH 4 sources, almost all of which involve water–rock reactions. See Etiope and Sherwood-Lollar (2013) for a review of abiotic CH 4 sources on Earth.  Primitive planet-building material from the outer Solar system, beyond the ice line, is replete with CH 4 , since it is the most thermodynamically stable form of carbon in reducing (i.e., H-abundant) conditions. Therefore, planetary bodies constructed from this material may be expected to contain an abundance of abiotic CH 4 . Such is the case in the atmosphere of Saturn's icy moon Titan, whose atmosphere contains 5% CH 4 by volume. CH 4 is likewise the most thermodynamically stable form of carbon in highly reducing, H 2 -dominated atmospheres. Therefore, CH 4 is often viewed as a companion biosignature that would be most compelling if observed together with O 2 /O 3 or other strongly oxidizing gases. CH 4 may also serve as a biosignature or habitability marker with the presence of CO 2 , since the presence of CO 2 implies the atmosphere's redox state is more oxidizing and thus not conducive to producing CH 4 as the most stable form of carbon (Titan's atmosphere has very little CO 2 ). In an atmosphere with a significant amount of CO 2 , the CH 4 would have had to originate from biology or from abiotic water–rock reactions, an indirect evidence of liquid water in the planetary environment.  The dominant sinks for CH 4 in the modern Earth's atmosphere involve oxidation of CH 4 by radical species, such as hydroxyl (OH), O(1D), or Cl, for example:  Formaldehyde (H 2 CO) formed through this reaction can be further oxidized to CO 2 and H 2 O, or incorporated into rain and transported to the ocean. In more reducing atmospheres, CH 4 photodissociation can drive the formation of longer chain hydrocarbons, ultimately leading to organic haze particles, as observed in Titan's atmosphere. Under anoxic conditions, CH 4 tends to be long lived in the atmosphere, but the advent of OP on Earth eventually led to the dramatic reduction of atmospheric CH 4 content (Pavlov and Kasting, 2002).  CH 4 absorbs throughout the VIS-NIR-MIR with its strongest bands at 1.65, 2.4, 3.3, and 7–8 μm. There are also weaker bands at (in order of increasing strength) 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, and 1.4 μm. However, CH 4 bands in the visible and NIR are relatively weak at the abundances of modern Earth. The strongest band in the infrared, centered between ∼7 and 8 μm, absorbs at the long-wavelength wing of the ∼6 μm H 2 O band and overlaps with N 2 O, which also absorbs strongly between 7 and 9 μm. At each of CH 4 's strong bands, it overlaps with H 2 O absorption, which makes uniquely detecting CH 4 problematic at low spectral resolution.  4.2.4. Nitrous oxide (N 2 O)  N 2 O is produced by Earth's biosphere via incomplete denitrification of nitrate (NO 3 −) to N 2 gas. A simplified scheme for denitrification can be written as follows:  N 2 O has been proposed as a strong biosignature, in part, because its abiotic sources are small on modern Earth and because it has potentially detectable spectral features (Sagan et al., 1993; Segura et al., 2005; Rauer et al., 2011; Rugheimer et al., 2013, 2015a). The preindustrial concentration of N 2 O in Earth's atmosphere was ∼270 ppb (Myhre et al., 2013). It has been proposed that euxinic oceans (replete with hydrogen sulfide [H 2 S]) during portions of the Proterozoic epoch would have stifled the bioavailability of copper that facilitates the last step in the denitrification process (i.e., the reduction of N 2 O to N 2 ), allowing biogenic N 2 O to build up in the atmosphere with possible climatic implications (Buick, 2007; Roberson et al., 2011). For a biogeochemically analogous world, N 2 O may exist at higher concentrations than seen on modern Earth (e.g., Meadows, 2006; Kaltenegger et al., 2007). Photochemical modeling of terrestrial atmospheres around M dwarf stars has shown that N 2 O would build up to higher concentrations than on an Earth–Sun analogue given the same source fluxes (Segura et al., 2005; Rauer et al., 2011; Rugheimer et al., 2015a). This is a mechanism like that described for CH 4 above (Section 4.2.3) and is due, in large part, to a paucity of near-UV photons from cool M stars owing to their lower effective temperatures.  A small abiotic source of N 2 O on Earth is known from “chemodenitrification” of dissolved nitrates in hypersaline ponds in Antarctica (Samarkin et al., 2010), although the synthesis of NO 3 − requires photosynthetically generated O 2 . In this scenario, therefore, abiotic N 2 O production is ultimately an expression of biological activity on Earth. A small amount of N 2 O is also produced by lightning (Levine et al., 1979), although the estimated contribution of total atmospheric N 2 O from lightning on Earth is 0.002% (Schumann and Huntrieser, 2007). Around young or more magnetically active stars, N 2 O may build up abiotically due to enhanced production of NO and NH from extreme ultraviolet (EUV-XUV) and particle flux-induced photodissociation and ionization, driving the reaction NO + NH →N 2 O + H (Airapetian et al., 2016). However, abiotic processes that generate N 2 O create associated nitrogen oxide (NO x ) products in far greater abundance than N 2 O (Schumann and Huntrieser, 2007), some of which may be spectrally observable and thus provide a signature of this process. In contrast, cosmic ray events are predicted to destroy N 2 O and favor production of nitric acid (HNO 3 ) (Tabataba-Vakili et al., 2016).  Ultimately, the confidence with which N 2 O can be considered a robust biosignature must be evaluated in the context of the stellar environment as well as through observation of other photolytic products that would indicate abiotic N 2 oxidation. Fortunately, current studies suggest that abiotic sources of N 2 O are small except in cases where its production would be contextually predictable or inferable from planetary observations at many wavelengths, although disentangling N 2 O spectral features from overlapping gases may be difficult at low to moderate spectral resolving powers. N 2 O has significant bands centered at 3.7, 4.5, 7.8, 8.6, and 17 μm, with several weak bands between 1.3 and 4.2 μm and between 9.5 and 10.7 μm. However, most of these bands are weak at Earth-like abundances and/or overlap with other potentially abundance gases such as H 2 O, CO 2 , or CH 4 , which may make detecting N 2 O challenging (Fig. 4). Observations at very high spectral resolution powers, at the level required to identify individual lines, may allow unique detection of N 2 O from overlapping gas absorption features.  4.2.5. Sulfur gases (DMS, DMDS, CH 3 SH) and relation to detectable C 2 H 6  Biology produces several sulfur-bearing gases as direct or indirect products of metabolism. The direct products of metabolism tend to be simple sulfur gases such as H 2 S, carbon disulfide (CS 2 ), carbonyl sulfide (OCS), and SO 2 , although these are also produced in abundance by abiotic volcanic and hydrothermal processes and thus are not strong biosignature gas candidates [e.g., see Arney et al. (2014), for an analysis of these gases in the Venusian atmosphere]. More complex sulfur gases such as CH 3 SCH 3 or DMS, CH 3 S 2 CH 3 or DMDS, and CH 3 SH (also known as methyl mercaptan) are produced as indirect products of metabolism but have few if any known abiotic sources on modern Earth.  The organosulfur gases (CH 3 SH, DMS, DMDS) are produced by bacteria and higher order life-forms in a variety of environments, including wetlands, inland soils, coastal ecosystems, and oceanic environments (Rasmussen, 1974; Aneja and Cooper, 1989). There are two principal routes to the production of DMS. The first is the biological degradation of the compound dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), which is found primarily in eukaryotic organisms such as certain types of marine algae (Stefels et al., 2007). This pathway is believed to be the dominant source of DMS, which is the largest source of organosulfur gas in the modern atmosphere (Stefels et al., 2007). Second, DMS (and DMDS) can ultimately result from the production of CH 3 SH, itself a decomposition product of the essential amino acid methionine. Microbial mats containing cyanobacteria and anoxygenic phototrophs produce measurable amounts of CH 3 SH, DMS, and DMDS (Visscher et al., 1991, 2003), likely from the reaction of short-chain organic compounds produced by the phototrophs reacting with sulfide produced by sulfate-reducing bacteria.  It has been hypothesized that the more reducing environment of early Earth would have been conducive to the production of greater volumes of sulfur gases by the anoxic biosphere (Pilcher, 2003; Domagal-Goldman et al., 2011). The potential for photochemical buildup and the detectability of sulfur gases on early Earth exoplanet analogues were investigated by Domagal-Goldman et al. (2011), who considered biospheres that produced between 1 and 30 times the estimated modern-day fluxes for these gases during the Archean eon. These authors found that DMS, DMDS, and CH 3 SH were rapidly destroyed by photolysis reactions in the atmosphere, leading to near-zero mixing ratios at all but the lowest levels of the atmosphere (e.g., see Domagal-Goldman et al., 2011; their Fig. 2). Moreover, that study found that, even for biospheres with very high sulfur fluxes, their low abundance in the atmosphere, a consequence of efficient photochemical destruction, would render DMS, DMDS, and CH 3 SH spectrally undetectable except in the narrow case of an M star with suppressed UV activity (Domagal-Goldman et al., 2011). However, the study also found that the cleaving of methyl (CH 3 ) radicals from DMS and DMDS by UV radiation catalyzed the photochemical buildup of C 2 H 6 far beyond the level expected for the abundance of CH 4 in the atmosphere, which is otherwise the primary precursor to C 2 H 6 . Consequently, it was proposed that this anomalously high C 2 H 6 signature would be suggestive of a sulfur biosphere (Domagal-Goldman et al., 2011), although this may only be the case for high flux rates of organosulfur gases in combination with stellar hosts with a favorable UV spectrum for C 2 H 6 production.  However, the detection of C 2 H 6 alone would be an ambiguous signature, since photochemical processing of other carbon-bearing species such as CH 4 can generate it. The link to an organosulfur biosphere would necessitate constraints on the C 2 H 6 to CH 4 abundance ratio to determine whether there is an overabundance of C 2 H 6 relative to that which would be expected only from photochemical equilibrium with the retrieved CH 4 abundance. This would reveal the likelihood of other sources of CH 3 such as DMS that would act to increase the amount of C 2 H 6 . Necessarily, this comparison would also require forward modeling of the atmospheric photochemistry given the UV spectrum of the host star, the retrieved CH 4 abundance, other measured or likely atmospheric constituents, and additional planetary parameters such as the atmospheric temperature structure, which may or may not be available.  Although Domagal-Goldman et al. (2011) evaluated only synthetic direct-imaging spectra in their investigation of DMS and DMDS spectral detectability, their results also apply to transmission spectroscopy. Although transmission spectroscopy can enhance the signature of gases with low abundances through path length effects (e.g., Fortney, 2005), this advantage is relevant only for gases with a presence in the portions of the atmosphere probed by transmission spectroscopy. Due to the combined effects of refraction, clouds, and aerosols, the lowest levels of an Earth-like atmosphere are not accessible (García Muñoz et al., 2012; Bétrémieux and Kaltenegger, 2014; Misra et al., 2014a, 2014b). Domagal-Goldman et al. (2011) found DMS and DMDS drop to near-zero abundance at all but the lowest levels of the atmosphere. Combined with results from direct imaging, these relationships suggest DMS and DMDS are examples of gases that, while exhibiting measurable spectral signatures in a laboratory setting, may never reach the required abundances to be directly detectable over interstellar distances for plausible biospheres. More encouragingly, their presence may be indirectly inferred by the detection of their photochemical by-products, in this case C 2 H 6 . This approach is analogous to the detection of O 3 to infer the presence of its primary precursor, O 2 , in the atmosphere, with appropriate caveats considering other photochemical sources of C 2 H 6 stated previously.  The strongest features of DMS are in the MIR at 6–7, ∼10, and ∼15 μm. DMDS absorbs strongest spectrally in the MIR at 7, 8–9, and 17 μm. CH 3 SH has its strongest features at 6–7, 8–12, and 14–15 μm. Notably, these gases all have absorption features that overlap with the 9.65-μm O 3 band (Pilcher, 2003), which could be problematic at low spectral resolution. C 2 H 6 has strong spectral signatures at 6–7 and 11–13 μm and a weaker band at 3.3 μm.  4.2.6. Methyl chloride (CH 3 Cl)  CH 3 Cl, or chloromethane, is a biogenic gas whose major sources on Earth are both natural and anthropogenic: algae in the oceans (Singh et al., 1983; Khalil and Rasmussen, 1999), tropical/subtropical plants (Yokouchi et al., 2002, 2007; Saito and Yokouchi, 2006), aquatic plants in salt marshes (Rhew et al., 2003), terrestrial plants (Saini et al., 1995; Rhew et al., 2014), fungi (Harper, 1985; Watling and Harper, 1998), decay of organic matter (Keppler et al., 2000; Hamilton et al., 2003), biomass burning (Lobert et al., 1999), and industrial processes involving organic matter (Kohn et al., 2014; Thornton et al., 2016). Volcanoes may be an abiotic source (Schwandner et al., 2004; Frische et al., 2006). The relative contributions of these biological and abiotic sources remain unknown for the modern and ancient Earth (Keene et al., 1999). The biological production mechanisms for CH 3 Cl are also poorly characterized (Rhew et al., 2014), although a CH 3 chloride transferase enzyme has been identified (Ni and Hager, 1998), and methylation of plant pectin (during degradation) is a general pathway across taxa (Hamilton et al., 2003). It appears there is not a unique pathway to production, but biosynthesis in numerous organisms, decay or combustion of organic matter, and volcanic gas-phase reactions can all produce CH 3 Cl.  Spectral absorbance features occur at 3.3, 7, 9.7, and 13.7 μm (Rothman et al., 2013) (note overlap with the 9.65 μm O 3 band). The dominant pathway for removal of CH 3 Cl is reaction with OH radical, with an estimated atmospheric lifetime of 1.3 years on Earth (WMO, 2003). In stellar environments with extremely low NUV flux suppressing OH formation, such as would take place in the quietest theoretical lower limit of M dwarf activity with no chromospheric excess UV flux, there is a potential to build up CH 3 Cl to detectable levels (Segura et al., 2005), although the feature overlaps with other expected features such as H 2 O, CO 2 , O 3 , and CH 4 . CH 3 Cl would be best observed at 13.7 μm in the wings of the CO 2 feature (Rugheimer et al., 2015a).  4.2.7. Haze as a biosignature  Geochemical evidence suggests the existence of an intermittent organic haze during the late Archean geological eon (Zerkle et al., 2012; Izon et al., 2017). This haze would have dramatically impacted Earth's climate, photochemistry, and spectral observables. The putative Archean organic haze is like the organic haze in Titan's atmosphere in that it likely forms from CH 4 photochemistry. At the CO 2 levels suggested for the Archean Earth (atmospheric fractions of roughly 10−3–10−2) (Driese et al., 2011), a ratio of CH 4 /CO 2 of about 0.2 is required to initiate the formation of a thick organic haze (e.g., Trainer et al., 2006). CH 4 on Earth can be produced by both abiotic and geological processes. On the modern Earth, biological processes produce the bulk of the atmosphere's CH 4 , as was likely during the Archean eon (Kharecha et al., 2005). The dominant abiotic CH 4 source on modern Earth—and likely the dominant abiotic source during the Archean—is serpentinization, the hydration of ultramafic minerals such as olivine and pyroxene (Kelley, 2005; Etiope and Sherwood-Lollar, 2013; Guzmán-Marmolejo et al., 2013), although the ultimate source of CH 4 in serpentinizing systems is not entirely clear (McDermott et al., 2015; McCollom, 2016).  Coupled photochemical-climate modeling has shown that producing a thick organic haze in the atmosphere of an exoplanet with Archean Earth-like CO 2 levels requires surface CH 4 flux rates consistent with measured modern biological CH 4 production [roughly 1011 molecules/(cm2·s)] and theoretical Archean biological CH 4 production rates [∼0.3–2.5 × 1011 molecules/(cm2·s), Kharecha et al., 2005; also see Arney et al., 2016, 2017, 2018]. Like CH 4 itself, organic haze would not definitively imply the existence of life, but organic haze produces strong, broadband absorption features at UV-blue wavelengths (the reason why Titan is orange), potentially more detectable than CH 4 itself. Because haze dramatically alters the broadband shape of a planet's reflected light spectrum (Fig. 7), it may provide a relatively simple means of flagging interesting targets for follow-up observations to search for other signs of habitability and life. Organic haze formation is incompatible with O 2 -rich atmospheres and so would exist exclusively on exoplanets with reducing atmospheres, providing a useful means for identifying potentially inhabited worlds with more reducing atmospheres than modern-day Earth.  FIG. 7. Spectra of Archean Earth with three different haze thicknesses for atmospheres with 2% CO 2 (Arney et al., 2016). The haze absorption feature at UV-blue wavelengths is strong and potentially detectable at spectral resolving powers as low as 10. UV, ultraviolet.  In the same way that organic haze could serve as an indicator of the CH 4 /CO 2 ratio, and therefore, a gauge of the CH 4 flux, it has been proposed that sulfur aerosols (S 8 and H 2 SO 4 ) could serve as a proxy of the H 2 S/SO 2 ratio and a gauge of the H 2 S flux (Hu et al., 2013). At high H 2 S/SO 2 flux ratios, and a neutral to reducing atmosphere, S 8 aerosols would be formed. At low H 2 S/SO 2 flux ratios, H 2 SO 4 is formed preferentially over S 8 . Oxidizing conditions that include even trace amounts of O 2 (<10−5 present atmospheric level [PAL] pO 2 ) result in H 2 SO 4 formation dominating over S 8 (Pavlov and Kasting, 2002; Zahnle et al., 2006). Geologic H 2 S fluxes can be complemented by biological H 2 S fluxes originating from microbial sulfur reduction or sulfur disproportionation, common metabolic processes on Earth (Finster, 2008). The spectral properties of S 8 and H 2 SO 4 aerosols differ with S 8 aerosols absorbing in the UV-blue region, while H 2 SO 4 displays strong absorption at λ > 2.7 μm. In principle, if volcanic H 2 S and SO 2 fluxes could be constrained, sulfur aerosol properties may indicate whether implied H 2 S fluxes imply an additional, biological source of H 2 S, serving as a potential biosignature (Hu et al., 2013). However, constraining volcanic sources remotely will be difficult and would require estimating the extent of subaerial versus submarine volcanism, which favors different H 2 S/SO 2 outgassing proportions. More conservatively, characterizing sulfur haze properties would allow an independent assessment of the redox state of the atmosphere with S 8 indicating reducing conditions, and H 2 SO 4 indicating oxidizing conditions. This could contribute to the overall appraisal of planetary habitability even if biogenic H 2 S fluxes were not constrained.   4.2.8. Other gases  The gases described above do not exhaust the list of volatile compounds produced by life on Earth, but encompass the unambiguous biogenic species widely believed to have been able to produce a measurable spectral impact at some point in Earth history. Other biogenic compounds are generated in abundance by Earth's biosphere but are not observed to rise to remotely detectable concentrations in a planetary disk average or are also produced in abundance by common abiotic processes. For example, isoprene is a common volatile organic compound produced by plants, phytoplankton, and animals, including humans (King et al., 2010), but is quickly destroyed photochemically in Earth's oxic atmosphere (Palmer, 2003). Other secondary metabolic products (in contrast to direct products of metabolism such as O 2 ) fit this mold, and are reviewed in Seager et al. (2012; e.g., their Table 3). Gases that are generated as products of metabolic processes, but also have common abiotic sources, encompass almost all simple molecules, including H 2 S, SO 2 , N 2 , H 2 O, CO 2 , and many more.  4.3. “False positives” for biotic O 2 /O 3 and possible spectral discriminators  The stated consensus as expressed in Des Marais et al. (2002) was that abiotic O 2 could be found on terrestrial exoplanets, but only on planets outside of the HZ (i.e., either too close to the star or too far away to support habitable conditions). A tectonically active, water-rich planet with an active hydrological cycle was thought to have the capacity to remove abiotic O 2 from the atmosphere through geochemical or weathering reactions [e.g., the reaction of O 2 with reducing volcanic gases or crustal ferric iron, Fe(II)].  The prevailing view has now evolved since Des Marais et al. (2002), with at least a few plausible mechanisms for generating O 2 abiotically on planets within the HZ, including from robust photolysis of CO 2 or a history of extreme hydrogen escape and O 2 buildup (e.g., Domagal-Goldman and Meadows, 2010; Hu et al., 2012; Domagal-Goldman et al., 2014; Tian et al., 2014; Wordsworth and Pierrehumbert, 2014; Gao et al., 2015; Harman et al., 2015; Luger and Barnes, 2015). For example, several authors have found that some abiotic O 2 (and O 3 ) could be produced in a prebiotic Earth-like, N 2 -CO 2 -H 2 O atmosphere with a surface ocean if the UV spectrum of the host star favored robust CO 2 photolysis (Domagal-Goldman et al., 2014; Tian et al., 2014; Harman et al., 2015). These authors find that the extent of abiotic O 2 /O 3 depends on a host of other boundary conditions (such as the flux of reducing gases and compounds), which may vary greatly from planet to planet. Significant hydrogen escape and O 2 buildup may be facilitated by atmospheres with low amounts of noncondensing gases lacking a cold trap (Wordsworth and Pierrehumbert, 2014) or an extended greenhouse phase after planetary formation due to the protracted superluminous premain sequence evolution of M dwarf stars (Luger and Barnes, 2015; Tian, 2015). These O 2 buildup scenarios need not completely deplete the entire H 2 O reservoir of the planet, but may exhaust O 2 sinks [such as crustal Fe(II)].  Each of the abiotic processes described above would generate their own spectral fingerprint, such as the simultaneous spectrally detectable presence of CO and O 2 from CO 2 photolysis (Harman et al., 2015; Schwieterman et al., 2016) or the absence of N 2 (Wordsworth and Pierrehumbert, 2014), which may be revealed through a lack of (N 2 ) 2 absorption (Schwieterman et al., 2015b) or constraints on atmospheric mass through Rayleigh scattering (e.g., Benneke and Seager, 2012). Highly evolved atmospheres that have experienced significant H-loss could be identified by highly density-dependent O 4 features (Schwieterman et al., 2016) and by extended scale heights in transmission spectroscopy in the case of O-enriched He-dominated atmospheres (Hu et al., 2015). Conversely, the existence of plausible mechanisms for abiotic O 2 strengthens the case for searching for biosignature couples such as O 2 + CH 4 , possibly establishing more robust evidence for life. Other novel routes for abiotic O 2 buildup require highly desiccated atmospheres in tandem with the UV spectral energy distribution found in M dwarf stars (e.g., Gao et al., 2015), which may be identified through the absence of conventional habitability markers such as water vapor.  Considering all the above, our understanding of the plausible abiotic mechanisms for the presence of O 2 in exoplanet atmospheres is accompanied by action points that would assist in designing instruments and strategies for observing and characterizing potential biosignatures. This topic is explored extensively in Meadows (2017) and a companion article in this issue, Meadows et al. (2018).  4.4. Biosignatures in other types of atmospheres  It has been shown that atmospheres with H 2 -dominated compositions could be habitable even with little CO 2 and at instellations lower than those predicted for the outer edge of the traditional HZ (Stevenson, 1999; Pierrehumbert and Gaidos, 2011; Seager, 2013). In addition, studies of exoplanet demographics from the Kepler mission have found that the most common type of planet is intermediate in radius (and mass) between Earth and Neptune (Batalha, 2014; although this conclusion is limited by the completeness of the Kepler sample, which is biased toward short-period planets). Referred to as “super-Earths,” the stronger gravity of these planets increases the likelihood that their atmospheres could contain a low-molecular-weight component (i.e., H 2 , He) over geologic time. (Note this does not suggest super-Earths may have a massive H 2 envelope like that of Neptune, which is not supported by data [e.g., Rogers, 2015]; the low-molecular-weight component would have to be small enough, relative to the planet's overall mass, to have a negligible impact on bulk density. This does rule out a significant H 2 fraction of a thin, terrestrial atmosphere, which is a negligible portion of a rocky planet's overall mass.)  However, we do not currently have examples of either abiotic or biological scenarios for rocky planets with significant H 2 fractions in our Solar System, although both early Mars and early Earth may have had a climatically significant H 2 component that requires further study (e.g., Tian et al., 2005; Ramirez et al., 2013; Wordsworth and Pierrehumbert, 2013). This situation introduces additional challenges for establishing biosignatures. However, if robust biosignatures are identified for exoplanets with a substantial component of H 2 or He, they will be significantly more detectable in transit spectroscopy because they will increase the scale height and therefore the transmission depths of spectral features (Miller-Ricci et al., 2009; Seager et al., 2013b; Ramirez and Kaltenegger, 2017).  Many reducing, H-bearing gases (e.g., CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , H 2 S) are problematic biosignatures in these atmospheres because abiotic equilibrium or kinetic processes could efficiently produce them. Just as in high-molecular-weight atmospheres, the most compelling signatures will be those that have equilibrium or kinetic barriers that prevent them from being easily generated abiotically.  Plausible biosignatures in H 2 -dominated atmospheres could include NH 3 , CH 3 Cl, DMS, and N 2 O (Seager et al., 2013a, 2013b). Seager et al. (2013a, 2013b) proposed that NH 3 may be generated biologically in atmospheres dominated by H 2 and N 2 via the reaction N 2 + 3H 2 → 2NH 3 since it is exothermic (energy yielding). Kinetic barriers prevent this reaction from occurring spontaneously at habitable temperatures. However, false positives include outgassed NH 3 from primordial material in the solid planet, exogenous delivery of cometary material, buildup from low UV emission from the host star, and chemical equilibrium reactions if temperature conditions are met in the subsurface or deep in a thick atmosphere. NH 3 is thus far the only biosignature candidate unique to H 2 -dominated atmospheres (Seager et al., 2013a, 2013b). NH 3 has major absorption complexes near 2.0, 2.3, 3.0, 5.5–6.5, and 9–13 μm.  DMS, CH 3 Cl, and N 2 O are possible biosignature gases for both H 2 -dominated and Earth-like atmospheres (Seager et al., 2013a, 2013b; Sections 4.2.4 to 4.2.6 and references therein). N 2 O would be an intriguing biosignature on an H 2 -dominated world, because it would have no abiotic sources. However, it would not be generated from energy-yielding metabolism (since producing it would be energetically unfavorable in an H 2 atmosphere)—although it could be an incidental by-product of metabolism in niche cases.  Additional biosignature gases in novel environmental contexts are currently being explored, but are highly speculative. An alternative, complementary, approach to empirically examining biosignatures gases is instead to begin with “all small molecules” that may be produced by (exo)life and subsequently filter those gases by their potential buildup in an atmosphere and their potential spectral detectability (Seager et al., 2016). Potential future directions in assessing novel biosignature gases are explored more deeply in the Walker et al. (2018) companion article in this issue.  4.5. Effects of the host star spectrum on photochemistry  In studies of planetary atmospheres generated by the fixed supply of gases (e.g., volcanic outgassing at a specified rate), changing the host star's type, and by extension of the wavelength distribution of light impinging on the planet, can dramatically alter the steady-state composition of the atmosphere. As mentioned in Sections 4.2.1–4.2.2 and 4.2.4–4.2.5, changes in the UV environment when transitioning from a G-type to an M-type star lead to increases in the concentrations of some biogenic gases, such as N 2 O, O 3 , and DMS (Segura et al., 2005; Rugheimer et al., 2015a). This possibility holds true for other gases as well, such as the abiotic generation of O 2 mentioned in Section 4.3. In addition, these changes can be driven by a host star's age, since a star's spectrum changes with time, potentially even before the star has evolved on to the main sequence (e.g., Ramirez and Kaltenegger, 2014; Luger and Barnes, 2015). Finally, the amount of radiation the planet receives represents one part of the equation when determining whether the planet has liquid surface water. Water vapor photolysis drives several catalytic cycles in the modern Earth's atmosphere and is expected to play a similar role in the atmospheres of planets around other stars. Taken together, the host star's spectrum has primary and secondary roles in determining the chemical composition of a planet's atmosphere.  One persistent consequence of the host star's spectrum is the planet's UV environment, as mentioned previously. Because UV photons are responsible for most of the photochemistry occurring in a planet's atmosphere, decreasing amounts of UV can lead to high concentrations of gases otherwise destroyed by UV photolysis, perhaps to unphysical levels if other potential sinks are not accounted for. For example, Zahnle et al. (2008) pointed out that a dense, cold, CO 2 -dominated early martian atmosphere would be unstable to rapid and irreversible conversion to CO and O 2 (a “runaway”). A similar result was found by Gao et al. (2015) for Mars-like planets orbiting M dwarf host stars. In these cases, the cold surface temperatures limited water vapor photolysis, which in turn prevented the efficient catalytic recombination of CO and O 2 . For the O 2 false-positive mechanism outlined in Section 4.3 by Harman et al. (2015), this same process occurs due to a lack of UV photons, rather than a lack of water vapor. On the other end of the spectrum, large amounts of UV radiation, in conjunction with higher stellar luminosities, can drive the photolysis (and ultimately the loss) of water vapor (Luger and Barnes, 2015).  Returning to low-UV environments, each potential biosignature gas mentioned in Sections 4.2.1–4.2.5 is subject to UV photolysis. Because of this, the same sort of “runaway” behavior has been noted for both CH 4 and N 2 O for planets orbiting UV-inactive late M stars (Rugheimer et al., 2015a). These cases persist even with large increases in the UV flux (Rugheimer et al., 2015a), suggesting that, at least for planets orbiting stars that are typically UV-quiet, we might expect higher concentrations of relevant biosignature gases, but as mentioned previously, lower UV fluxes also give rise to false-positive scenarios.  4.6. Impacts of flares and particle events on biosignature gases  In addition to a host star's time-averaged UV irradiation, stars can generate flares, charged particle events, and coronal mass ejections. The strength and frequency of these types of events vary with the star's size and age. For example, the young Sun was likely much more active than it is today, potentially for hundreds of millions of years (Güdel et al., 1997), and smaller stars (M4 and later) tend to be active for even longer periods of time, up to 8 Gyr (West et al., 2008). For terrestrial planets, these events can drive the photochemical modification of the atmosphere away from steady state, and, if strong flares and events occur frequently enough, could result in those modifications becoming the norm. If the planet in question is like prebiotic Earth, this situation could lead to the buildup of N 2 O from abiotic nitrogen oxidation (Airapetian et al., 2016), which may constitute a false positive. Alternatively, higher XUV fluxes driven by an increased number and intensity in flares may also drive more substantial atmospheric escape, which may render a terrestrial planet uninhabitable—in line with estimates for planets in high time-averaged UV environments (e.g., Luger and Barnes, 2015; Airapetian et al., 2017). In addition, planets around smaller stars may be subject to increased cosmic ray fluxes, which can modify the concentrations of key biosignature gases through the creation of NO x radicals (Grenfell et al., 2012).  Besides potentially producing false positives and desiccating planetary atmospheres, high-energy events can decrease the prevalence of other biosignature gases. An Earth-like planet struck by a single strong stellar flare would see only a small decrease in O 3 concentrations initially due to enhanced UV irradiation, but charged particles would produce a much larger decrease occurring over longer timescales, weeks to months (Segura et al., 2010). Subsequent flares within the flare recovery window would be expected to aggravate this effect but may be insufficient to completely remove the O 3 layer (Tabataba-Vakili et al., 2016). This flare activity may introduce detectable concentrations of other gases such as HNO 3 , potentially allowing for the characterization of flaring trends beyond the observational window (Tabataba-Vakili et al., 2016), which provides further motivation for better constraints on the X-ray, UV, and charged particle environment for observed exoplanets.   5. Surface Biosignatures  Life may alter the spectrum of the surface of a planet through a variety of mechanisms, which include absorption and reflection of light by pigments in living organisms, scattering by the physical structures of organisms (including individual organisms and community architectures), degradation products of biological molecules, fluorescence of pigments, and bioluminescence. Each of these mechanisms may produce remotely detectable biosignatures; however, not all such biological spectral phenomena may be widespread enough to be detectable at the global scale on Earth, and not all are without abiotic mimics. Below, we catalog surface biological spectra arising from photosynthesis, other pigments, and reflectance features associated with cellular protection and ecological functions, and chiral biomolecules.  We summarize the spectral properties of known biomolecules on Earth, but note that only one surface spectral signature, the VRE, has been confirmed to produce a unique biological fingerprint on the disk-averaged spectrum of our planet. Other biomolecules that have been suggested in the literature thus far remain subjects for further research. In general, even on Earth, the spectra of such molecules can be subject to variation according to environmental conditions, physiological status, and species differences, tempering the likelihood of attaining diagnostic features that fingerprint exactly the molecules in question as is the case for gaseous absorption spectra. However, “edge” spectra are potentially powerful surface biosignatures that can occur throughout the visible and NIR (Hegde et al., 2015; Schwieterman et al., 2015a; Poch et al., 2017) and whose expression can depend on a host of factors, including intrinsic chemistry of major biomolecules, pigment acclimation relative to the environmental photon flux spectrum, and evolutionary contingencies. While we begin to explore the question of how these signatures may manifest on another planet, Walker et al. (2018) further address the challenges involved and explicitly outline fruitful avenues for future empirical and theoretical studies.   5.1. Photosynthesis  Since the review by Des Marais et al. (2002), OP remains the source of the most robust known planetary-scale biosignature: atmospheric O 2 and the surface reflectance spectrum of vegetation, the VRE. Anoxygenic photosynthesis, which likely evolved before the oxygenic variety, produces potentially diagnostic surface features, described below, but no robust gaseous signatures are yet known. Because photosynthesis leverages incident energy from the host star, it is the metabolic process with the greatest potential to affect the planetary environment, and is therefore essential to understand when making predictions of planetary-scale biosignatures. At our current state of understanding, it remains uncertain what different pigment colors might result from photosynthesis under different stellar irradiation and what other biogenic gases might result from photosynthesis adapted to other planets. The precise developmental pathway of photosynthesis, and specifically the evolutionary sequence of OP, is still an active area of inquiry (see Meadows et al., 2018, this issue), and scientific understanding is not yet sufficient to say whether the same or similar route of evolution would be followed on another planet. However, light energy use and storage in photosynthesis obey certain universal principles that also apply for solar energy from photovoltaic cells and must apply as well on exoplanets. The use of light energy to drive the movement of electrons is a remarkable feat of nature, involving a coordination of quantum dynamics and redox chemistry. In lieu of having a complete catalog of specific wavelengths to target for spectral features of surface pigments, understanding the fundamentals of photosynthesis, and the unknowns, should allow us to speculate on alternative expressions of photosynthesis on other planets.  Below we summarize basic principles of photosynthesis as well as important unknowns, the molecular nature and spectral features of light harvesting pigments, and how the VRE results. We then review the body of work to date that has delved into potential alternative photosynthetic biosignatures in other environments, and recent discoveries about photosynthesis that currently both challenge and enhance our understanding and ability to predict photosynthetic biosignatures on exoplanets.   5.1.1. Principles of photosynthesis  All life involves oxidation/reduction (redox) reactions to transfer electrons from one chemical species to another. Whereas chemotrophs acquire free energy from redox gradients in the environment, photosynthesis utilizes light to generate its own redox gradients to perform biochemical reactions. Photosynthesis is the ultimate expression of life adapted to a star: stellar light is converted to chemical energy and used to drive biosynthesis of organic matter from CO 2 . Thus, photosynthesis can drive redox cycles in the environment to sustain life beyond the lifetime of the free geochemical energy originally available. The basic processes of photosynthesis can be found in textbooks (e.g., Whitmarsh and Govindjee, 1999; Blankenship, 2014) and are briefly summarized below. The general net equation is as follows:  H 2 A is a reductant that is oxidized biochemically (not photolyzed) to provide electrons for biochemical reactions. For OP, the H 2 A reductant is H 2 O, and for anoxygenic photosynthesis, it may be H 2 S, H 2 , Fe2+, or other reductants. hν is the input photon energy, where h is Planck's constant, ν is the photon frequency c/λ, where c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength of the photon wavelength. CH 2 O represents a reduced form of carbon in a sugar or carbohydrate in which energy is stored. The above equation is a net endergonic reaction; without the input of light energy, the back reaction is energetically favorable.  How is the light energy used and how does this determine a photosynthetic biosignature, pigment or gaseous? The above is a net equation that involves several separate steps in sequence, which follow these basic features for quantum harvesting of light energy, illustrated in the redox potential diagram of a generic photosynthetic “reaction center” in Fig. 8.  FIG. 8. Events in a photosynthetic reaction center electron transport pathway with noncyclic electron flow. Vertical axis shows redox potential in volts, with the convention being that negative is more reducing and positive is more oxidizing, with free energy reactions moving an electron from more negative to more positive. The P denotes the ground state of the primary photopigment, P* its excited state, and, not on the diagram, P+ is the state when an ejected electron has been captured, leaving an electron hole.

Sanders made his case on the Boston Common on Saturday to 13,000 supporters stirred up by the cold and the soundtrack – Revolution by Flogging Molly. Echoing across the nation’s oldest public park was the call and response of “Not me, us”.  The Democratic establishment is getting “very nervous about our campaign”, he said. “Tonight they’re going to turn on the TV and find that 10,000 people came out to the Boston Common, and they’re going to become even more nervous.”  Warren was elected Massachusetts senator in 2012 and re-elected in 2018. While Sanders is concentrating on winning the delegate-rich states of California and Texas on Super Tuesday, he has also been campaigning for lower delegate states such as Virginia and Massachusetts, which has 91 up for grabs.  Sanders told the crowd he beats Trump in 65 out of 70 national polls, and covered a variety of policy topics, including income inequality, housing, climate change, and health care. He promised to raise the wages of teachers to $60,000 a year, create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and instill criminal justice reforms like ending cash bail.  Warren’s team is counting on its early organizational investment in the contests to come: a staff of more than 1,000 spread across 31 states, including in the major Super Tuesday battlegrounds. To sustain her campaign, Warren is relying on a prodigious small-donor fundraising operation, an enthusiastic base of supporters, and relatively high favorability ratings.  Sanders dedicated Friday and Saturday to Massachusetts, following a new WBUR poll showing that his lead had grown to 25% , ahead of Warren’s 17% in the state. Only five months ago, Warren held a 20% lead over the Vermont senator, but that appears to have fallen away. Sanders is the current Democratic leader in delegates, with more than 50.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Bernie Sanders leaves the stage after delivering a speech during his rally in Boston, Massachusetts. Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters  Warren is not giving up home turf easily, but she is noticeably absent from the Bay State this weekend, with campaign events in South Carolina, which voted decisively for former vice-president Joe Biden on Saturday, as well as Arkansas and Texas, which cast their votes on Super Tuesday with 12 other states in the biggest night of the election cycle bar election days itself.  Warren has cast herself as the progressive candidate who can unite the party, and her supporters believe there is a double standard at work – that Warren, as one of the last remaining women in the race, is hurt by a fixation on electability and that she is held to a higher standard on policy, despite having an arsenal of plans to combat the climate crisis, break up big tech, cancel student loan debt and create a Medicare for All healthcare system.  On Friday, House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, of Massachusetts endorsed Warren, calling her the “best candidate to take on Donald Trump on the economy”. Her campaign surrogates, including Representative Ayanna Pressley and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey held canvass kick offs Saturday morning, as dozens of canvasses were planned across the state.  When asked following the CBS News Democratic debate if she can count on her home state to back her, she declined to give a definitive answer. “Look, I’m out here making my case to everybody all across the nation and I’m so deeply grateful to the people in my home state who helped me beat an incumbent Republican back in 2012.”  Sanders has both the Nevada caucus and New Hampshire primary under his belt, and a near tie with Buttigieg in the Iowa caucuses, making him a current frontrunner.  On Friday, he drew around 5,000 people to Springfield in Western Massachusetts and told the crowd: “I’m here tonight to humbly ask for your support”.  Nick Woods, a human services worker, said that although Warren has done great things for the state, “Sanders is the one who can go toe to toe with Trump in November – that’s what the polls say.”  For South Boston’s 17-year-old Nico Iannecone, Sanders will be the first candidate for president that he plans on voting for in November. Medicare for All and “getting money out of politics” are big issues for him. He’s claimed to have shifted business man Andrew Yang’s former supporters to join the Sanders camp. Iannecone said he wouldn’t consider a vote for Warren.  Iannecone said: “Elizabeth Warren is like Bernie Sanders for rich people.” He said he feels her support for Medicare for All has not been consistent, and that she accepted money from billionaire supporters during her Senate run. “I’ve just been disappointed.”  The endorsement of the week for Warren may have come from the Boston Globe editorial board, which flip-flopped after urging her not to run for president in 2018. Then the publication ran a column saying that Sanders’ “raid behind her political lines is an affront to his Senate colleague, supposed friend, and left-wing ally. Any advantage he gains would come at the cost of her dignity.”  The Warren campaign says it has the support of about 150 elected officials across the state, including Representative Joe Kennedy III. At an event last week, Kennedy dismissed comments of Warren losing her state.  “I believe in her. I think the people here believe in her. I expect she’s going to have a great day here, and I think she’s going to have a great day across the country.”  Jessie McLaren was listening to Sanders with her eight-year-old daughter Maple on her shoulders. McLaren, 48, is a single mother with over 43,000 of student loan debt and intends to vote for Sanders.  She said she loves Warren, but was voting for Sanders because “Bernie is more electable against Trump, the predator.”  Lauren Gambino contributed to this report  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 7, "positive": 32, "negative": 6, "joy": 4, "anger": 15, "surprise": 4, "fear": 3, "trust": 7}, "metadata": ["bernie", "sanders", "massachusetts", "elizabeth", "warren", "progressive", "super", "supporters", "democratic", "california", "virginia", "trump", "climate", "criminal", "relying", "poll", "vermont", "leader", "rally", "campaign", "joe", "biden", "election", "debt", "medicare", "healthcare", "endorsed", "calling", "donald", "cbs", "caucus", "buttigieg", "iowa", "billionaire", "senate", "globe", "urging"]}, {"text": "SYDNEY (REUTERS) - The toddler son of a volunteer firefighter killed battling wildfires in Australia received one of the service's highest honours on behalf of his father during an emotional funeral on Thursday (Jan 2).  Nineteen-month-old Harvey Keaton stood quietly, sucking on a pacifier, as the fire service commissioner pinned a posthumous commendation for bravery and service to his neatly pressed, oversized Rural Fire Services (RFS) shirt.  Harvey's father, 32-year-old Geoffrey Keaton, was one of three volunteer firefighters killed in recent weeks. Mr Keaton and a colleague died last month when a burnt tree fell in the path of their fire truck, causing it to roll. The third firefighter died this week in what was described by the authorities as a \"fire tornado\".  Dozens of firefighters saluted and formed a guard of honour as Mr Keaton's hearse drove into a Sydney cemetery, according to pictures of the funeral posted online by the fire service.  A mug placed on the coffin had a picture of father and son stick figures and the inscription: \"Daddy I love you to the moon and back!\" Another photograph from the funeral showed Harvey being held by his mother, Mr Keaton's fiance Jess Hayes, as they looked at a portrait of the firefighter atop his coffin.  NSW state Royal Fire Services Commissioner Craig Fitzsimmons, who has been giving daily briefings on the crisis, knelt down to pin the medal on Harvey's shirt.  Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who has faced some criticism for his response to the fires, also attended.  The NSW RFS said on Twitter it had \"farewelled one of our own\".  Eight people have been killed by wildfires in the eastern states of New South Wales and Victoria since Monday, and 18 are still missing.

In a nutshell: \"Trump,\" \"money\" and \"work.\"  In fact, America's neighbors to the north and south give somewhat different answers when asked to provide a descriptor, in a single word, that reflects their views of the U.S.  President Donald Trump's last name is by far the most frequently mentioned word in Canada, followed by various mostly negative characteristics such as \"chaos,\" \"confused\" and \"bully.\" In Mexico, Trump also features prominently in response to the question. But the most commonly cited words are \"money,\" \"work\" and \"migration,\" alongside more negative expressions like \"discrimination\" and \"racism.\"  The survey was conducted in spring 2019, well before the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic came under scrutiny.  It also found that large majorities in both countries lack confidence in Trump to do the right thing on world affairs and disapprove of some of his key foreign policies.  Few Canadians or Mexicans offered positive words about the U.S., the survey showed, although men were about twice as likely in both places to do so. In Canada, the figure was 11% of men versus 5% of women; in Mexico, 17% of men versus 8% of women.  Previous Pew studies have shown that America's global image is complicated. Majorities of international populations give the U.S. high favorability ratings when it comes to respecting the civil liberties of individuals, and most countries prefer the U.S. as the world's leading superpower over authoritarian China, but confidence in the U.S. presidency has plunged under Trump compared with his predecessor, Barack Obama. Western European countries France, Germany and the United Kingdom, in particular, now say that the U.S. does not do enough to protect individual liberties.  Since taking office in 2017, Trump has clashed with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over a range of issues from climate change to North Atlantic Treaty Organization military alliance commitments. The two leaders have also, at times, appeared to mend fences; for example, over the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) free trade deal ratified by each nation, and Mexico.  USMCA may take effect this summer.  In recent days, Trudeau has said he won't retaliate against Washington after Trump ordered 3M, a Minnesota-based manufacturer of protective health care equipment, to stop exporting face masks to Canada amid the coronavirus pandemic.  Trump has made reducing the flow of hundreds of thousands of people who travel through Central America to the U.S. a cornerstone of his foreign policy. Rule changes to reduce asylum claims and efforts to build a physical barrier on the U.S. border with Mexico form part of his efforts to crack down on illegal immigration.  Pew's survey found that Mexicans more frequently used neutral words rather than negative ones to describe the U.S. However, among the negative words, \"bad,\" \"racist\" and \"injustice\" were among the most cited. There was a link in Mexico between wanting to live in the U.S. and the words chosen, although it represented a small proportion.  Mexicans who had the means and opportunity to live in the U.S., but chose not to, were twice as likely (38%) to say something negative about the USA compared with those who would like to live and work there but had no obvious path to make it happen (19%).

As a result, there is an enormous deficit in understanding what is happening in the countryside, which is where the truly radical changes are taking place.”  Also read: In Times of Quarantine, Let Pankaj Kapur’s Debut Novella Be Your Literary Valentine  One could not imagine a better venue than the Frank Lloyd-Wright designed Guggenheim museum for the design savant to put up a show of this scale and ambition. Koolhaas’ team, comprised of students from Harvard’s Graduate School of Design, where he teaches, and Samir Bantai, the head of research at his firm, have made optimal use of the structure’s unique spiral-shaped gallery. The Guggenheim was designed to resemble an ancient structure known as a ziggurat. A ziggurat has a pyramidal structure with a walking path along the exterior surface that narrows as it climbs upwards.  Wright inverted the ziggurat when he designed the Guggenheim, widening the outer walls and the passageway as the building rises to the pinnacle.  As we begin our walk up the inverted ziggurat, we are greeted with an essay embossed on a white wall about the evolving relationship between urban centres and the imagined ideal of the bucolic countryside, and the successive waves of migration from the former to the latter. We are introduced to French philosopher and utopian socialist, Charles Fourier’s attempts at reconstructing society through a network of self-sufficient micro cities in the countryside called Phalantseries. The various projects inspired by Fourier’s influential theories, including the hippie communes of the sixties and seventies, are also displayed here.  Level two, called ‘Leisure and Escapism’, is lined with a decorated curtain that traces the ideals of a spiritual life in nature as conceived by philosophers of the ancient world, up to the way that the contemporary wellness industry has commodified spirituality with holistic healing resorts, spas and new age retreats situated in exotic settings around the world, often to the detriment of the natural habitat.  The “political redesign” of the countryside is explored in eight case studies on level three that include examples of radical social engineering across the rural hinterland in the Soviet Union under Stalin, China under Mao and Libya under Gaddafi. The brutal human cost of these colossal endeavours by authoritarian regimes, however, is barely touched on.  Although the exhibit features large passages of text on the gallery walls, the experience remains “fundamentally different” to reading a book, according to Troy Conrad Therrien, the curator of Architecture at the Guggenheim. “It’s closer to an opera or a film where you have an incredibly dense playbill, or a series of subtitles as you go.”  Also read: ‘Father’ of Asterix Comic Series, Albert Uderzo Passes Away  On the fourth level, the spotlight is on China and other parts of the world as exemplars of innovative use of the hinterland. Here, Koolhaas looks at how medium to large-scale sustainable farming in high-rise structures has revolutionised the agrarian sector and the creation of rural e-commerce villages known as Taobao in partnership with Jack Ma’s Alibaba platform. “China is the only country that has an official policy on what to do with the countryside,” he says admiringly. “The state is seriously involved in maintaining the countryside but also creating new possibilities in the countryside.”  While it is fascinating to see China’s boundless entrepreneurial energy, it’s muzzling of critics and media, it’s numerous human rights travesties and brutalisation of the Uighur and Tibetan people are conspicuous by their absence.  The fifth level, called ‘Nature/Preservation’, focuses on the effects of global warming and climate change in the countryside, since that is where the climate crisis is having the maximum impact. Two world maps called ‘Half Earth’ and ‘Shared Planet’ are highlighted. They illustrate the two proposed methods to integrate the vast green belts of earth with modern cities in order to meet the carbon reduction targets of the Paris Agreement.  ‘Half Earth’ is based on E.O. Wilson’s 2016 Manifesto. It calls for a drastic separation between an almost pristine nature on the one hand and human habitation and cultivation on the other. The second proposal puts forward a more intensive sharing/mixing of all our territories. Both approaches imply radical changes in food production, ideology and agricultural techniques.  This section also includes studies exploring the pernicious effects of climate change on the vast stretches of uninhabited land, such as the thawing of permafrost in Siberia, and the impact of major preservation efforts to save endangered wildlife species threatened by disruptions to the ecosystem and food chain.

Although the show is an ambitious effort to address the big issues confronting our species, it often feels like a sanitised romp through the cerebral ruminations of an ivory-tower academic not used to dealing with the unordered messiness of the human experience. While there is much food for thought about how our relationship with the environment has evolved over the last few millennia, the most resonant section of the show describes how successive waves of Kurdish and African immigrants helped in revitalising the dying Calabrian towns of Raice and Camini until a crackdown by Italy’s right wing leader, Matteo Salvini, put a damper on it.  This sense of detachment from the human experience is not by accident but design, as we find out in an essay by Koolhaas in the exhibition catalog, praising what he calls the “post-human” architecture he encountered at Tahoe Reno Industrial Center (TRIC), the largest industrial park in the world, which serves as a backroom for tech giants Google, Apple, Amazon and Tesla.  “There has been no architecture of a similar vigour in the last 100 years,” he writes in an ode to the mega-structures, the largest of which spans nearly one million square kilometres. “It is based strictly on codes, algorithms, technologies, engineering and performance, not intention. Its boredom is hypnotic, its banality breathtaking.”  Koolhaas may rhapsodise about the cold efficiency of algorithm-designed structures, or even see them as the inevitable next step for humanity, but human needs and desires will always take precedence in the grand scheme. A future lacking the ineffable essence of what it means to be human is a textbook example of dystopia.  As Plato said, “Human behaviour flows from three main sources: desire, emotion, and knowledge”. Focusing on the last while ignoring the first two is a formula for disaster, one that we cannot afford.  Vikram Zutshi is a cultural critic, author and filmmaker.

However, there is at least one other “existential crisis” that is most often overlooked – the very existence of unions as an effective representative of working-class interests is at risk. Trump and the Republicans have launched a broad offensive involving all three branches of government to undermine the legal and civil foundation of organized labor: the right to be represented by a union and to collectively bargain for wages, benefits, and working conditions.  Four more years of Trump could result in the utter demise of the labor movement and the immiseration of a large portion of workers while furthering the concentration of income, wealth and power among a corporate and billionaire elite. This is not to say that Biden and the Democratic Party are the second coming of FDR and the New Deal. However, Biden and the Democrats are not out to destroy unions and, at the very least, will blunt the corporate/Republican anti-union crusade. And, at best, Biden and the Democrats will enact pro-worker legislation to the degree that unions and progressive groups are mobilized and activated. While the Democrats represent the possibility of pro-worker legislation especially if pushed by mass mobilization, Trump and the Republicans are out to destroy unions no matter what we do.  In a series of three articles, I will examine the anti-worker offensive launched by the Republican Party and President Trump as well as the alternative offered by the Democratic Party and Biden. This first article will analyze the reasons why the Republican party has declared a war against unions. The second article will examine the two-pronged offensive launched by President Trump and the Republican Party against unions; namely, stacking the deck by appointing proven anti-union ideologues to key positions and rigging the rules by enacting anti-union/pro-corporate policies. The final article will describe Biden’s stated policy positions in relation to labor and propose a number of recommendations for union supporters to mobilize not only to defeat the anti-union Trump led Republican Party but also to ensure that a Biden administration follows through on his pro-worker promises.  While these articles focus on the attack on workers’ rights and the promotion of corporate power, they are in no way meant to take away from the importance of the other crises and issues we face – the struggle for workers’ rights is inextricably linked to the struggle for civil, human and economic rights; a clean and healthy environment; an equitable distribution of income, wealth and power; and the creation of an effective and functioning democracy.  The GOP Wants to Destroy Unions  The Republican Party has historically been a bitter opponent of labor unions. Since the New Deal, Republicans have consistently supported efforts to weaken unions by eliminating or eroding statutory protections for the right to organize and collectively bargain for better wages, benefits and working conditions. Most famously, Republicans initiated and overwhelmingly supported the Taft Hartley Act which weakened unions by prohibiting many of the tactics that made unions formidable during the 1930s and 1940s. President Reagan launched another attack against unions when he broke the air traffic controllers union (PATCO) during his first term and legitimized the use of non-union “permanent replacements” for striking union workers. As will be examined in the next article, President Trump and the current Republican Party have taken this anti-union crusade to new heights.  Big Business funds – and therefore controls - the Republican party. According to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, big business invested $20.1 billion in federal campaign contributions from 1990 through the first half of 2020. Republicans received 57% while Democrats received 43%. Business trade associations including the powerful US Chamber of Commerce gave 84% of their campaign contributions to Republicans and just 16% to Democrats. A 2019 report examining the donations of the CEOs of the top 1,500 publicly traded companies from 2000-2017 found a strong bias in favor of Republicans: 57.7% donated to Republicans, 18.6% to Democrats, with the rest leaning toward neither party. Even though big business does give billions of dollars to Democrats and thus has a lot of power within the Democratic Party, big business gives many billions more dollars to the Republican Party which it dominates. Meanwhile, unions invested just $1.6 billion in total campaign contributions from 1990 to 2020 – 91% of which went to Democrats.  Big Business Wants to Destroy Unions – therefore, the Republican Party Acts to Destroy Unions. Big business does not overwhelmingly fund the Republican party for altruistic reasons – there is a quid pro quo. And part of the deal is that the Republican party must follow the lead of big business in opposing unions.  Unions form the largest civil institution that serves the interests of working people. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, unions represented 16.4 million workers or 11.6% of the employed workforce in 2019. While this percentage is far lower than 1983 when unions represented 23.3% of the workforce, it is still a very large block of voting age Americans with shared interests and organizational connections. Union households represent an even larger share of the national electorate: according to CNN exit polls, union households represented 18% of the national electorate in 2016 – and much larger shares of voters in key swing states such as 28% of Michigan voters in 2016  Unions advocate policies opposed by Big Business and oppose policies advocated by Big Business. Unions have initiated and/or provided critical support – while Big Business and Republicans generally opposed - the eight-hour day, the five-day workweek, overtime, minimum wages, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Obamacare, occupational safety and health regulations, paid family leave, the expansion of governmental programs aiding lower income workers and much more. Unions also have strongly opposed many of the policies advocated by big business including tax cuts that disproportionately favor corporations and the wealthy; the elimination or erosion of worker, environmental and consumer protections; the elimination of limits on the amount of legal campaign contributions by corporations and wealthy individuals; the privatization of crucial government services and agencies such as social security, the post office, public education; and much more  Unions force corporations to share some of their gains and power with workers. Union-represented workers on average have higher wages and better benefits than non-union workers. According to the BLS, among full-time wage and salary workers, union members had median weekly earnings of $1,095 in 2019, while those who were not represented by unions had median weekly earnings of $892. Thus, union workers make almost $10,600 more a year than non-union workers. Moreover, according to another BLS report, union represented workers have substantially greater access to health, pension, paid time off, and other benefits. Corporations do not appreciate the higher wages and benefits obtained by union represented workers because they cut into profits, even though union workers are more productive than non-union workers. But corporations really do not like unions because they reduce management power over the workplace. For example, union represented workers obtain the contractual obligation of due process and just cause for discipline and firing. Union workers have representation throughout a contractual process to determine whether an employer has just cause for discipline or firing. Non-represented workers are “at will” and do not have such protections: they can be fired for basically any reason except those few instances protected by law such as race, gender, disability and religion  Unions reduce income inequality. A recent study by three Princeton University economists found that unions reduced income inequality in the United States, not just for union members but for the entire distribution of workers and wages. An earlier study by sociologists Bruce Western and Jake Rosenfeld had a similar finding, that “unions not only equalize union members' wages, they also equalize the nonunion wage distribution by threatening union organization and buttressing norms for fair pay. We found strong evidence that unionization rates in detailed industries for geographic regions are positively associated with wage equality among nonunion workers.”  The Republican Party also opposes unions in order to weaken the Democratic Party. Obviously, the Republican Party competes with the Democrats for votes and thus positions of political power. Consequently, Republicans will do all they can to weaken the Democrats which makes unions a prime target.  Unions are a core constituency of the Democratic Party. As previously mentioned, unions directed 91% of their campaign contributions to Democrats from 1990 through the first half of 2020. In presidential elections, 60-66% of union households have historically supported Democratic presidential candidates – except for 2016 when just 53% voted for Clinton while 42% voted for Trump (as compared to non-union households which voted 46% for Clinton and 48% for Trump). Unions also supply thousands of volunteers to canvass neighborhoods and get out the vote. These on-the-ground efforts are probably more important than labor’s direct cash contributions  Unions are a more powerful force for progressive policies than the Democratic Party. A Nation article details research that shows the critical impact of unions on policy and the Democratic Party.  • Political scientists Benjamin Radcliff and Martin Saiz found that the strength of unions in particular states is a more powerful determinant of liberal policy than the power of the Democratic Party in those states.  • Political scientists Thomas Volscho and Nathan Kelly found that unions exert a more powerful influence on the share of income going to the 1 percent than does the share of Congress that is controlled by Democrats  • Other research also suggests that unions increase voter turnout, and that this effect is strongest for workers of color. More recent work on the impact of Citizens United finds that its effect on policy liberalism was muted in states with more powerful unions  By weakening unions through “Right to Work” laws, the Republican Party weakens the Democratic Party. The Republican Party has championed Right to Work laws as a means to weaken labor unions. Unions are required by law to collectively bargain for and represent all workers in their bargaining units whether they are members or not. However, right to work laws prohibit unions from collecting payments from all these workers to help pay for the cost of bargaining and contract administration. In other words, workers represented by unions can refuse to help pay for the costs the union incurs to represent them. Union supporters call such workers “free riders.” The clear intent of such laws is to reduce union revenue, the number of members and, thus, to weaken unions. And that is exactly what happened. For example, from 2012 (the year before Right to Work was adopted in Michigan) to 2019, the 14 major public and private sector unions lost 130,000 members (16% of their membership) and $20 million in revenue. Wisconsin adopted a bill that significantly curtailed the collective bargaining rights of public sector workers in 2011 and adopted a right to work law in 2015. The combined impact of these laws has been significant: from 2010 to 2019, Wisconsin union membership declined by 137,000 or 39%.  But the impact was not just felt by unions. A major study examined the impact of Right to Work laws not only on unions but also on the Democratic party:  Right-to-work laws reduce Democratic presidential vote shares by 3.5 percentage points.  There are similar effects in US Senate, US House, and Gubernatorial races, as well as on state legislative control  Turnout of union members is 2 to 3 percentage points lower in right-to-work counties after those laws pass  The share of blue-collar workers reporting a get-out-the-vote contact declines by 11 percent following the passage of right-to-work laws  Total campaign contributions from all unions falls by 2.5 to 3 points  The 3.5% reduction of union presidential votes probably cost Hillary Clinton the presidency: she lost Michigan by just 10,704 votes, a margin of just 0.23% and lost Wisconsin by just 22,748 votes or a margin of just 0.7%.  Republican party voters are primarily located in states with an anti-union history. The strength of the Republican party is centered in states that have adopted anti-union policies such as the “right to work” laws described above. It is no surprise that the Republican Party launched, and corporate donors funded a major effort to extend right to work laws to “fair share” states. Since 2010, six additional states controlled by Republicans passed Right to Work laws for a total of 27 states altogether. These 27 states accounted for 83% of the current crop of Republican senators; 82% of Trump’s total 2016 electoral college votes; and almost 70% of the total number of Republican representatives.  The Democratic Party Is Much Better on Labor Issues Than the Republican Party  The Democratic Party is not a labor party. Unions form an important constituency of the Democratic Party in terms of funding, voting and providing the volunteers needed for canvassing, phone banking and getting out the vote. Ironically, the Republican Party recognizes the importance of unions to the Democratic Party more than the Democratic Party. And, Big Business provides billions of dollars in support to corporate Democrats – a significant source of Democratic funding though much less than the contributions to Republicans. The importance of corporate money and influence has pushed many Democrats toward policies that aid corporations and hurt workers. Two examples illustrate the power of corporations in the Democratic Party. First, Presidents Carter, Clinton and Obama failed to prioritize labor law reforms that would have assisted unions in their fight with corporations and would have strengthened the Democratic Party. These bills failed because they were not prioritized by the Presidents and the Senate filibuster rule that gave outsized importance to Senators from anti-union, especially southern states. Second, President Clinton pushed through NAFTA and the China trade deals that led to the combined loss of 4 million jobs – many of which were good union jobs. Clinton was able to push these policies through Congress with the support of most Republicans and despite the opposition of most Democrats. President Obama attempted to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership, called NAFTA on steroids. However, he was thwarted by opposition from labor, environmental, consumer, civil rights and religious groups – and most Democratic members of Congress.  However, despite all of that, a higher percentage of congressional Democrats are now more pro-union than ever. This is the result of the extinction of anti-union/pro-segregation Southern Democrats who have now become Republicans and the expansion of voting rights to Black and Latinx citizens who are more pro-union. Conversely, Democrats strengthened their hold in pro-union states as pro-union Republicans disappeared. Consequently, Democratic support for labor law reform has steadily increased among Congressional Democrats over time. For example, Obama – despite the issues noted above – appointed very pro-union individuals to the NLRB who issued many pro-union rules. Not one congressional Democrat supported the Republican led drive to roll back many of the new NLRB rules in 2015 when the Republicans controlled both the House and Senate. This pro-union solidarity among Democrats prevented a Republican override of Obama’s veto of the legislation. And when Republicans did roll back a number of Obama era pro-labor rules when they controlled both houses of Congress, not one Democrat supported the effort. This entire trajectory was described in an interesting article by Nathan Newman who concluded, “There is [Democratic] unity in defense of labor interests in the modern Democratic Party that was nowhere to be seen during the New Deal era.”  Democrats, despite Republican opposition, were responsible for passage of civil rights, age discrimination, disability rights, pregnancy discrimination, occupational safety and health, and the Family and Medical Leave acts. State laws in Democratic states are much more labor-friendly than those in Republican controlled states.  The point here is not that the Democratic Party is a labor party – it is not. And it is clear that our entire political system is dominated by corporate money. However, it is also clear that Democrats are much more pro-worker than the Republican Party. Indeed, as the next article will show – the Republican Party has launched an offensive to debilitate unions – an offensive led by President Trump, Republican majorities in the Senate and the federal judiciary and officials in Republican controlled states.   The Bottom Line  The Republican Party sees unions and their supporters as enemies to be politically and economically destroyed. The Democratic Party will not destroy unions and actually provides the possibility to assist unions in representing the interests of working people.

The scarcity of natural resources is leading to conflict and migration.  THE SAHEL AT THE HEART OF CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES  By Julie Mayans,Food Security and Livelihood adviser in SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL  From Mauritania to Chad, the vicious circle of droughts and floods has serious consequences on the populations who live mainly from agriculture and livestock. The scarcity of water resources threatens livelihoods.  In the Sahel, droughts are becoming more and more intense. Temperatures are rising 1.5 times faster than in the rest of the world. But climate change is also causing heavy rains (violent thunderstorms, above-normal rainfall). However, the land is too dry to absorb the rising waters; Destructive river floods and numerous flooding episodes were thus observed in Mali and Niger in 2019.  In the Sahel more than elsewhere, these natural disasters are degrading the natural resources that are essential to the agropastoral livelihoods that underpin the economy in much of the area. Two out of three people in the Sahel countries live from agriculture and livestock. Under the combined effect of drought and floods, land is deteriorating and losing its fertility. Insufficient rain-fed irrigation means that crops fail or are destroyed, while livestock struggle to find water for drinking and sufficient pasture. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that agricultural yields will fall by 20% per decade by the end of the 21st century in some areas of the Sahel.  The depletion of natural resources in the region has become a source of conflict between farmers and herders, especially as climate change has altered the routes and periods of livestock transhumance, which now often coincide with those of the land being cultivated. The economic impact is obvious for agropastoral populations whose crops or livestock are degraded. But the rest of the population, who relies on local products to eat, is also affected due to price inflation and the scarcity of these products on the markets.  The Sahelian populations are trapped in a vicious circle: this negative economic impact is further reinforced by natural disasters such as floods, which damage productive infrastructures as well as those that enable economic exchanges: roads, bridges, dams, buildings, irrigation networks, etc.  The current context, in addition to the climate of uncertainty prevailing in rural areas slowly degraded by climate change, has been pushing many people to migrate to urban centers. The latter are considered to be safe, less dependent on economic activities based on natural resources and therefore less affected by natural phenomena. This concentration of population in urban areas is likely to lead to overexploitation of natural resources and water supply networks. The population of the six French-speaking countries of the Sahel will increase six-fold, reaching 540 million by 2100, according to UN projections.  Moreover, due to the drying up of the surface water table, traditional open-well type water supply systems are no longer viable in the region. However, the technical capacities and financial means of the Sahelian countries to carry out deep drilling are severely limited. As a result, NGOs such as SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL have had to dig deeper and deeper to find resources. For example, in the northern Nigerian state of Borno, where a decade ago the water table was 30 meters above the surface, drilling now has to be carried out to a depth of 250 meters.  According to the Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS), climate change, which threatens the integrity of ecosystems already weakened by a rapidly growing population, will further exacerbate competition over natural resources and lead to population movements and conflicts in the region. Today in the Sahel, the challenges for the water access programs of SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL are :  to respond to the urgent need for access to drinking water, to help the greatest number of poor populations faced with the scarcity of resources, to promote a multi-use water response (water for people, water for agriculture and water for livestock), to support local authorities and the community for better water management and governance in the Sahel.

(AP) \" Historic fires are raging across the western United States ahead of what scientists say is the typical peak of wildfire season. Hurricane Laura devastated parts of the Gulf Coast last month, while swaths of Iowa are recovering from a derecho that brought hurricane force winds to the Midwest.  The streak of disasters has left millions of Americans reeling. But it's barely had an impact on the campaign for the White House, in part because of the vulnerabilities it highlights for President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden.  The president is already facing multiple challenges, including the pandemic, joblessness and social unrest, and can ill afford another one. When he talks about California, where fires have killed at least a dozen people and threatened thousands of homes, it's mostly to blast the state's Democratic leaders.  And for Biden, the spreading fires are a reminder to the party's progressive base that he doesn't embrace some of the most liberal elements of the Green New Deal, the grand plan for tackling climate change.  'The Biden campaign understands that a full embrace of an aggressive climate change agenda could create problems for them in Upper Midwest,' said Dan Schnur, who served as an adviser to former California Gov. Pete Wilson and Arizona Sen. John McCain. 'Trump has shown no desire to talk about California beyond using it as a liberal punching bag to make his case to his conservative base.'  Still, climate activists say the moment underscores the need for Washington to support the Green New Deal, an ambitious \" and likely costly \" plan to wean the U.S. from fossil fuels and drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions.  'It's no surprise that Trump isn't talking about the fact that America is literally in flames on his watch \" but why isn't Biden?' said Rebecca Katz, a political strategist who has worked with Democratic congressional candidates supporting the measure. 'For Democrats to not connect what's happening on the West Coast to Trump's failure on climate change is just political malpractice.'  The Biden campaign's response to the fires is especially notable since his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, represents California in the Senate. She was campaigning in Miami on Thursday, but her spokesperson, Sabrina Singh, said Biden and Harris 'have been closely monitoring the wildfires raging across the state and highlighting the urgent need to address the threat of climate change.'  Biden tweeted that climate change 'is already here \" and we're witnessing its devastating effects every single day.'  'We have to get President Trump out of the White House and treat this crisis like the existential threat that it is,\" he said.  While Biden hasn't embraced the full Green New Deal, he has promised to make creating new green jobs and drastically reducing U.S. carbon emissions part of a larger recovery plan designed to revive the economy after the coronavirus abates. Biden's top advisers note that many of his proposals will move the country toward the Green New Deal, but some activists worry it is not ambitious enough.  'I'm looking outside my window right now. Literally the world looks like it's on fire. For young people across the board, but especially young Latinos, we also care very deeply about climate change, not just like immigration,' said Christian Arana, policy director for the California-based Latino Community Foundation. 'This is a perfect moment to get on TikTok or do an interview with Teen Vogue or whoever to talk about these issues.'  Trump spoke with California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday \"to express his condolences for the loss of life and reiterate the administration's full support to help those on the frontlines of the fires,' according to White House spokesman Judd Deere.  But the president has a history of criticizing California's response to wildfires and threatening to withhold federal funding.  In 2019, months after the deadliest wildfire in California history tore through the town of Paradise in Northern California, Trump said the Federal Emergency Management Agency should stop giving the state money and blamed the fires on poor forest management. Fire scientists say climate change, not forest management, is a driving factor behind the state's fires becoming worse and more deadly.  Still, Trump has always approved California's request for major disaster declarations, as he did Aug. 22 as the state battled blazes across Northern California.  That approval came a day after he again blamed California for mismanagement and Newsom hit back in a video that aired during the Democratic National Convention in which he highlighted Trump's threats.  'Just today the president of the United States threatened the state of California, 40 million Americans who happen to live in the state of California, to defund our efforts on wildfire suppression because he said we hadn't raked enough leaves. You can't make that up,' Newsom said.  Trump visited Iowa last month to meet with officials there about the derecho, and he surveyed damage on the Louisiana-Texas border following Hurricane Laura.  Trump visited California in November 2018 after Paradise was ravaged by the most deadly wildfire in state history. But he currently has no plans to visit areas on the West Coast impacted by the fires, according to a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.  The official, who was not authorized to speak about the president's travel plans, said it would be unwise for Trump to visit while the fires are still active as it would divert key first responder resources away from the fire fight.   __  Madhani reported from Chicago and Weissert reported from Washington.

Previously redacted documents revealed in full by UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on 27 November have confirmed the details discussed in bilateral trade talks between US and UK officials since 2017.  Labour have used the documents to double down on accusations that Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the Conservatives were “misleading” the public on their “secret plans to sell off the NHS”.  The documents reveal that US officials had pressured the UK Government to move toward as hard a Brexit as possible, with complete divergence from EU regulatory standards and closer alignment to the US, in order to allow American corporations complete access to the UK market.  A hard Brexit and US regulatory alignment  Campaign group Global Justice Now said the leaks revealed trade talks were entirely on US President Donald Trump’s terms, with US officials shown to have said any possibility of a trade deal would be off if the UK remained aligned with EU standards, as was proposed in the first deal secured by then-Prime Minister Theresa May.   UK Government/Reddit  On the wider NHS, the US told UK officials they wanted any trade deal to start from the baseline that everything is on the table unless it is ruled out, rather than specific areas being offered up for negotiation.   NHS and drug pricing  Despite repeated denials by the Conservatives, the leaks reveal that the NHS, and in particular drug prices, was a subject of negotiation as Trump has originally suggested in a joint press conference with Theresa May during a Washington visit.  The US currently pays more per capita for pharmaceuticals than any other country in the world, with reports of Americans frequently travelling across the border to Canada and Mexico to purchase life-saving drugs at a fraction of the price they pay in the US.  Meanwhile, the UK enjoys some of the most competitive deals with drugs companies due to the buying power of the NHS – a situation Global Justice Now said US officials indirectly referred to by suggesting the health service did not pay enough.  The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and its counterpart in Scotland currently issue guidance to the NHS on the most appropriate, effective drugs it should use to treat patients, whilst also undertaking a cost-benefit analysis.  This means much more expensive medicines – usually new advanced drugs used to treat certain cancers – are not routinely available on the NHS without individual approval from a panel of experts – a system US officials appeared to want to change, so that major pharmaceutical companies could enjoy unfettered access to the UK market.  US officials also want longer patents for drugs made by US drug companies, limiting the ability of the NHS’s ability to prescribe cheaper but identical generic versions.  Central to the SNP’s manifesto is the NHS Protection Act, which could protect the NHS in law from such trade talks, and also give devolved parliaments a role in consenting to anything which could impact devolved health services.  Labour’s shadow secretary of state for health Jonathan Ashworth argued the Tories were trying to “play the public for fools”.  Ashworth said: “In these secret trade deal papers that Labour revealed yesterday, the NHS is very much on the table.  “And it’s crystal clear that the US is pushing for longer drug patents – which means massive drug price increases for our NHS. And on that basis, these papers show the UK is ready to move on to the next stage of a deal that will mean taxpayers will pay the price of soaring medical bills,” he said.   Food standards: Chlorinated chicken?  US negotiators also raised the UK’s current food regulation standards as a key issue, including offering the UK Government advice on how best to “sell” the idea of the infamous chlorinated chicken, which many consider emblematic of US food standards.  Currently, the UK operates a precautionary approach to food standards, with producers having to prove their products are safe before sale to the public. However, leaked documents reveal US and UK officials discussed the UK adopting the US approach of the Food and Drug Administration, where products were only withdrawn if evidence of harm could be proven.  Corbyn also told journalists that officials had discussed the UK’s approach to food safety labelling, with the documents showing the US objected to measures designed to tackle obesity, such as high sugar content labels.  Secret trade courts and “TTIP on steroids”  Global Justice Now also highlighted sections of the documents which show the US banning mention of climate change in trade talks, in line with Trump’s infamous scepticism of climate change, despite the overwhelming scientific evidence.  After the UK raised the issue, the documents report the US trade representative said “emphatically” that climate change was a “lightning rod issue” for the US, and that mention of greenhouse gas reductions could not be made in any trade agreement.  With discussion on action to tackle to climate emergency becoming an increasingly important topic to UK voters, the government will come under intense political pressure not to agree to any trade agreement which would block action on the climate.  Global Justice Now have also highlighted sections of the documents where the US had demanded protection for tech giants such as Facebook, prompting fears that despite increasing pressure worldwide for social media platforms to take responsibility in respect of misinformation, any action could be prevented by a trade deal.  Ultimately, the US wants to introduce a system of trade courts which would settle disputes after a free trade agreement, but which could also be used by big corporations to sue the UK Government for actions which restricted their access to the UK market.  Global Justice Now branded the leaks as “TTIP on steroids”, a reference to highly controversial and secretive talks for a so-called transatlantic trade and investment partnership between the EU and US which many feared would have opened up the EU to many of the same risks the UK now faces.

Florida-based NextEra, a big player in wind and solar energy, has overtaken the global oil giant as the most valuable US energy company by market value.  NextEra’s market capitalisation has surged to $145 billion (€123bn) compared with ExxonMobil’s $142 billion, another emblem of the Texas giant’s diminished status after it was bumped this year from the prestigious Dow Jones index after more than 90 years.  The ascendance of NextEra and other renewable-oriented companies is not merely a passing trend, said Peter McNally, an energy expert at research firm Third Bridge.  “I’ve seen fads in alternative energy come and go over the last decade, and I’m sure that people would debate the multiple investors are paying for the earnings generated,” he said in an interview. “They’re in the right place at the right time.”  Founded in 1925 in Florida where it continues to supply power to five million households, NextEra has invested in solar and wind energy since the 1990s.  Those investments are now paying off with technological leaps in renewable energy.  “Alternative power is now getting competitive with traditional forms of electricity, coal and natural gas fired generation,” McNally said. “If some of those investments had been made 10 years ago, they would likely have had a different outcome, because the cost of generating power from wind and solar has gotten a lot cheaper.”  Alternative power is now getting competitive with traditional forms of electricity, coal and natural gas fired generation - Third Bridge energy expert Peter McNally  NextEra is the biggest producer of wind energy in North America and among the biggest solar producers in the United States.  Equally important, investors have become much more focused on climate change and increasingly sympathetic to companies that embrace the idea that renewables will become a bigger part of the energy equation.  A similar sentiment also made Tesla the most valuable car company in terms of market value, outstripping General Motors and Ford, even though the traditional automakers sell many more cars.  In 2019, NextEra reported $3.8 billion (€3.2bn) in profits on $19 billion in revenues. During the same period, ExxonMobil garnered $14.3 billion (€12.1bn) in profits on revenues of $265 billion. ExxonMobil’s decline coincides with a lackluster outlook for oil prices in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing uncertainty over demand.  These dynamics have made ExxonMobil’s strategic decisions of recent years look especially bad. The oil giant invested almost $80 billion between 2017 and 2019, including about a third on US shale investments expected to boost production by one million barrels per day by 2024. But those targets appear destined to lapse.  With the crash in oil prices, ExxonMobil has slashed its capital budget this year.  By contrast, NextEra has benefited from regulated electricity prices and stable use. About two-thirds of its revenues are tied to supplying electricity.  Between this consistent source of revenues and its expertise in wind, solar and energy storage, NextEra is “very well positioned for this transition to renewable generation and emission free type world,” said Andrew Bischof, analyst at Morningstar.  “Investors definitely appreciate that type of carbon profile during this transition,” he added.

Aside from the typical examples of Old Glory, I am blessed with other interesting illustrations of emblematic nationalism.  Directly behind me, as I stand at the console, covering the entire wall (but notably missing stars for both Alaska and Hawaii), is a worn and tattered 48-star, 70-year-old rendition of our Stars and Stripes. Next to that behemoth are, proudly suspended, two Honor and Remember banners dedicated to soldiers lost in combat. Across the room, concealed slightly behind a radio microphone, is one bright yellow \"Don't Tread on Me\" Gadsden flag, and above that, slightly to the right, is a streamer paying homage to Betsy Ross.  The idea is to fill the room with a light-hearted but unapologetic sense of American pride. However, as a reminder of the true cost of freedom, positioned straight in front of me and always in view, are two folded triangular-shaped American flags enclosed in a black framed wooden-glass casing. One of these special flags came with an official proclamation and a federal seal with a document that reads \"This certifies that this flag was flown over the United States Capitol at the request of Congressman Joe Courtney\" — and is dedicated to a local man who died on 9/11. The second of these exclusive flags also flew over the Capitol and represents an Iraq war veteran who never came home.  Why am I sharing these details of my star-spangled radio studio with all of you?  On Election night, I sat in here, haunted by the same paraphernalia I celebrate every single day. This country is entangled in something bigger than a simple presidential election and we are at a crossroads, increasingly divided, with ideals and aspirations moving in polar opposite directions.  Are the American freedoms we've coveted for so long on the verge of ultra-left progressive attack? Democrat defenders will contend Joe Biden is a moderate and will govern as such, but we all know Senator Kamala Harris lurks in the shadows.  People did not vote for Joe Biden; they voted against President Donald Trump and, for that matter, against certain constitutional ideologies conservatives consider essential. Biden voters, by definition, are perfectly content with ripping apart history, tearing down statues, dismantling law enforcement, and fundamentally wanting to transform America  The presidency is normally decided on specific issues such as, taxes, heath care, abortion, climate change, unemployment or immigration. But the 2020 presidential election was a referendum on America itself. It consumed our nation and the embers that fueled this inferno were constantly stoked by the left-leaning media. Half of the nation felt the person in the White House represented the ideals of American patriotism while the other half was consumed with an unbridled, often undeserving hatred of the Commander in Chief.  Trump is far from perfect and was never my first choice to be president. However, given the choice between pretentious patriotism and no patriotism, I'll take the bombastic candidate every time.  With the 2020 presidential election still in limbo as of this writing, it will be fascinating to observe the reaction if Biden is eventually declared the winner. Will hate follow Biden like it pursued and attached itself to Trump?  Allow me to recall the words of Abraham Lincoln:  “Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war…  “This nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\"  We need to remember we are Americans First.

The coronavirus pandemic is compounding this situation, disrupting supply chains and increasing price volatility for rice and other staples. While Mekong governments have assured their populations of secure food supplies, concerns are growing around the affordability and accessibility of food for the region’s most vulnerable populations. Nowhere are these risks of growing food insecurity more evident than in Cambodia.  For farmers and fishers throughout the Mekong River Basin, the coronavirus couldn’t have hit at a worse time. In April 2019, the region began suffering a prolonged and severe drought. An El Niño weather pattern led to widespread water shortages, as the monsoon rains—which typically fall from May to October and usher in planting of the primary rice crop—failed to appear. Reservoirs across the region began to run dry, and the waters of the lower Mekong dropped to historic lows. Chinese dams on the upper Mekong worsened the drought’s impact, restricting water from flowing downstream where it could have alleviated record dry conditions.  Agricultural communities have suffered greatly. By July, Thailand declared an emergency in 12 provinces and asked farmers to delay planting rice crops to avoid using what little water was left for vulnerable households. Reservoir levels remained low throughout the rainy season, and in early 2020, Bangkok deployed the military to implement drought disaster mitigation in 43 provinces. Preliminary estimates point to a sharp drop of between 40 percent and 54 percent for the country’s off-season rice production. Meanwhile in Laos, water levels on the Mekong River were recorded nearly 7 meters below normal in Vientiane. Because of the arid conditions, farmers were able to plant rice only on around 40 percent of the country’s arable land, and the government estimated that production for the year would be 17,500 tons lower than in 2018. Vietnam has faced similar challenges but fared better. With freshwater flows in the Mekong diminished, saline seawater pushed farther into the country’s delta heartland, eventually damaging over 30,000 hectares of rice fields. The government moved quickly to work with farmers to shift rice-planting seasons and avoid risking the main crop, and as a result, the country’s production is anticipated to drop by only around 3 percent in 2020.  [Mapping the Coronavirus Outbreak: Get daily updates on the pandemic.]  Cambodia has been hit particularly hard by the drought. By December, some 45,000 hectares of rice paddy had been damaged, and 16 of the country’s 25 provinces were facing freshwater shortages. The government recommended that farmers forgo a second rice crop to conserve water, and aid organizations began to share reports of farmers struggling under the debt burden of failed crops.  As a still developing nation, Cambodia remains heavily reliant on agriculture to sustain livelihoods and provide food. Subsistence farming is common—the United Nations Development Program estimates that over 70 percent of Cambodian farms engage in some version of the practice—and the agriculture sector employs more than 30 percent of the population, contributing more than one-fifth of the national GDP. The majority of farmed land is used for rice, and farmers regularly take out loans to cover the cost of supplies necessary for their harvest. For many, a poor or destroyed crop yield can mean financial ruin.  Keep your eye on the ball.

The Mekong River system is the world’s largest freshwater fishery, typically producing more than 2.6 million tons of fish each year. A quarter of this comes from Cambodia and most of that from the Tonle Sap Lake. While heavy monsoons in 2018 led to a larger than usual catch, changes in flow from hydropower dams and climate change, as well as overfishing, have led to steeply declining catches in recent years.  The Mekong River’s natural productivity is fueled by the rains: The influx of water from the monsoon causes the tributary linking the Tonle Sap and the Mekong to reverse course. This reversal floods the Tonle Sap and carries juvenile fish into the surrounding forests and plains. When the monsoon ends, the river changes course once again, and water and grown fish flood back into the Mekong mainstream. The greater the flood, the more bountiful the fish catch. This flood pulse largely failed in 2019 because of drought and upstream dam interference with water flow. As early as October, fishermen living along the Tonle Sap Lake were reporting observed fish catches 60 to 70 percent below average.  As with rice, fish is a key source of sustenance for the country. More than 2 million Cambodians work in fisheries, which account for between 10 percent and 18 percent of Cambodia’s GDP. Fish also provide approximately 70 percent of the animal protein consumed in Cambodia, so a significant reduction could lead to acute spikes in food insecurity. In communities along the Tonle Sap, the drop in catch has contributed to an outmigration of labor and pushed families to take on loans to cover daily expenses.  The Economist Intelligence Unit’s Global Food Security Index lists Cambodia near the bottom of its rankings, at 90 out of 113 countries evaluated. Cambodia’s relative food insecurity reflects its modest level of economic development, as well as its lack of dietary diversity due to an overreliance on rice and fish. Even in a normal year, one-fifth of the population is food deprived, and undernutrition is widespread.  While the global market could normally provide substitutions for a drought year’s lost fish catch and diminished rice production, the coronavirus pandemic is leading to food shortages and price spikes where domestic supply chains have been disrupted. Demand for staples like rice and flour has surged due to panic-buying. In Cambodia, rice prices in Siem Reap rose 33 percent from March to April. Even in Thailand, which has a significant national stockpile of rice, prices have risen more than 25 percent since the start of the year, hitting their highest levels in seven years. After fish, pork is by far the most widely consumed protein source in Cambodia. But successive outbreaks of African swine fever in China and neighboring Vietnam have limited regional supplies over the last year, driving prices up in impacted markets and in countries like Cambodia that rely on imports.  Rice stockpiles in Thailand and Vietnam appear more than sufficient to meet national needs, but uncertainty around the extent to which the coronavirus will impact regional economies has translated into export bans to ensure domestic food security. In March, Vietnam briefly banned the export of rice, only to replace the ban with an export cap in mid-April. Analysts predict the country’s export volume will drop approximately 40 percent as a result. While Thailand hopes to benefit from increasing rice exports, its government has asked the private sector for support in ensuring that domestic supplies remain robust and banned the export of eggs following reports of localized hoarding. Cambodia has instituted its own measures, announcing an export ban on some types of rice on March 30 and on April 4 extending the ban to include fish exports. Negotiators from members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations met in early April to discuss rules for maintaining the open trade of agricultural goods but failed to reach a substantive agreement.  From its own assessment, Cambodia should have adequate food stocks to meet national demand; however, the outlook for vulnerable indebted fishing and farming communities is less sanguine. Access and affordability will become increasingly critical issues as the crisis wears on and the economic impacts build. The country’s export bans may provide localized short-term benefits but could also exacerbate supply chain disruptions and result in income loss for farmers and fishermen if not carefully managed. While cities that house the country’s elites and burgeoning middle class should be able to take steps to ensure food availability at reasonable prices, rural communities scattered in villages throughout the countryside may find their local food systems less adaptable.  In normal times, market mechanisms and supply chains enable substitutions for shortages or price spikes impacting staple goods—but these are not normal times. Poor Cambodians could be facing an unprecedented confluence of income loss, supply shortages, high food prices, and supply chain disruptions. The government will need to carefully monitor this situation in the near term and should be taking steps to prepare interventions in the event that the country’s farming and fishing communities are unable to provide for themselves.  Once the acute crisis sparked by the coronavirus threat has passed, Cambodia and its neighbors will still be faced with the long-term challenge of ensuring a sustainable and vibrant Mekong River system. While anthropogenic climate change and naturally occurring weather patterns like El Niños are largely beyond policymakers’ control, Mekong governments can act now to implement policies and protocols to mitigate the worst of their impacts in the future. This should include engaging with Beijing to negotiate year-round data-sharing on the river’s level and the operations of China’s upstream dam cascade. It should also include an exploration of alternatives to existing proposals for new dams on the Mekong and its tributaries in Laos, which if built would only worsen the already dwindling fish catch.  The coronavirus pandemic presents a difficult but hopefully short-term food security challenge for Cambodia’s most vulnerable. However, droughts will be a recurring problem for the region that will require a focused response to ensure agricultural crises do not become the norm. For Cambodia, which is so heavily reliant on the natural flood pulse for its food supply, preservation of the river’s natural flow to the Tonle Sap should be a top priority.

The analysis, released as part of a national study by the First Street Foundation, a nonprofit research and technology group, also found that New Hampshire properties are at a higher risk of flooding than most other states.  Nationally, according to the First Street Foundation Flood Model, 10.3% of all properties across the contiguous United States are currently at substantial risk of flooding, and 11.4% will be at substantial risk in 30 years. New Hampshire has a greater proportion of at substantial risk, the report found, with 11.1% – 64,900 – at substantial risk today and 11.6% – 67,900 – at substantial risk by 2050.  According to FEMA analyses, 29,000 New Hampshire properties are currently at risk and 32,000 will be at risk by 2050.  FEMA’s statistics don’t factor in climate change, and they don’t include millions of homes that have never been mapped for flood risk. To determine its numbers, First Street studied river, intense rainfall models and changing environmental factors into account by applying global climate model projections to forecast how flood risk will change over the next 30 years.  According to the First Street report, communities with the most properties at risk are:  Manchester, with 4,184 properties currently at risk (14% of all properties in the city) and 4,301 projected to be by 2050; Nashua, 2,648 in 2020 and 2,770 by 2050 (13% of all properties); Keene, 1,643 in 2020 (24%) and 1,684 in 2050; Concord, 1,483 in 2020 (12%) and 1,526 by 2050; Laconia, 1,481 (22%) and 1,502 by 2050; Portsmouth, 815 in 2020 (13%) and 1,104 by 2050; Lebanon, 809 in 2020 (19%) and 820 by 2050; Claremont, 695 in 2020 (14%) and 707 in 2050; Dover, 648 in 2020 (8%) and 724 in 2050; and Derry, 646 in 2020 (9%) and 690 in 2050.

Boosted by human-caused climate change, global temperatures averaged 60.75 degrees last month, edging out 2015 and 2016 for the hottest September in 141 years of recordkeeping, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Wednesday. That’s 1.75 degrees above the 20th century average.  This record was driven by high heat in Europe, Northern Asia, Russia and much of the Southern Hemisphere, said NOAA climatologist Ahira Sanchez-Lugo. California and Oregon had their hottest Septembers on record.  Earth has had 44 straight Septembers where it has been warmer than the 20th century average and 429 straight months without a cooler than normal month, according to NOAA. The hottest seven Septembers on record have been the last seven.  That means “that no millennial or even parts of Gen-X has lived through a cooler than normal September,” said North Carolina state climatologist Kathie Dello, herself a millennial.  What’s happening is a combination of global warming from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas and natural variability, Sanchez-Lugo said. But the biggest factor is the human-caused warming, she and Dello said.  The globe set this record despite a La Niña, which is a cooling of parts of the central Pacific that changes weather patterns and usually slightly lowers temperatures.  “A La Niña is no match for how much we’re warming the planet,” Dello said.  The first nine months of 2020 are the second warmest on record, a shade behind 2016 when there was a strong warming El Niño. But Sanchez-Lugo said her office’s calculations show that there’s a 64.7% chance that 2020 will pass 2016 in the last three months to take the title as the warmest year on record. And if it doesn’t make it, she said it’ll easily be in the top three, probably top two.  “We’re catching up” to 2016, Sanchez-Lugo said. “It’s a very tight race.”  With the climate trend, heat records that looked like it would take many years to break get passed quicker, said Colorado University weather data scientist Sam Lillo.   ___  The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

Fossil fuel extraction and use are among the largest anthropogenic sources of CH 4 emissions, but the precise magnitude of these contributions is a subject of debate2,3. Carbon-14 in CH 4 (14CH 4 ) can be used to distinguish between fossil (14C-free) CH 4 emissions and contemporaneous biogenic sources; however, poorly constrained direct 14CH 4 emissions from nuclear reactors have complicated this approach since the middle of the 20th century4,5. Moreover, the partitioning of total fossil CH 4 emissions (presently 172 to 195 teragrams CH 4 per year)2,3 between anthropogenic and natural geological sources (such as seeps and mud volcanoes) is under debate; emission inventories suggest that the latter account for about 40 to 60 teragrams CH 4 per year6,7. Geological emissions were less than 15.4 teragrams CH 4 per year at the end of the Pleistocene, about 11,600 years ago8, but that period is an imperfect analogue for present-day emissions owing to the large terrestrial ice sheet cover, lower sea level and extensive permafrost. Here we use preindustrial-era ice core 14CH 4 measurements to show that natural geological CH 4 emissions to the atmosphere were about 1.6 teragrams CH 4 per year, with a maximum of 5.4 teragrams CH 4 per year (95 per cent confidence limit)—an order of magnitude lower than the currently used estimates. This result indicates that anthropogenic fossil CH 4 emissions are underestimated by about 38 to 58 teragrams CH 4 per year, or about 25 to 40 per cent of recent estimates.

Mr Trump has been attacked by his critics for withdrawing from the Paris climate change agreement – a decision that Joe Biden said he would reverse on his first day in office — and for fostering tense relations with traditional allies of the US, such as Canada, France and Germany.  His critics also accuse him of cosying up to dictators, telling a press conference that he believed Vladimir Putin’s word over that of his own intelligence agencies, and they worry that his actions in Syria – where he rapidly withdrew US troops and left the Kurds stranded, at the request of the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan – have concerned America’s military allies.  They also note that his much-publicised meetings with Kim Jong-un have not yielded results — although they have arguably prevented further escalation.  His supporters praise his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement, his moving of the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and his efforts to make Nato members pay their fair share.

But Biden pulled together the 1,991 delegates needed to become the nominee Friday after seven states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries Tuesday.   Advertisement  Biden reached the threshold three days after the primaries because several states, overwhelmed by huge increases in mail ballots, took days to tabulate results. A team of analysts at The Associated Press then parsed the votes into individual congressional districts. Democrats award most delegates to the party’s national convention based on results in individual congressional districts.  Biden now has 2,000 delegates, with contests still to come in eight states and two U.S. territories.  The moment was met with little of the traditional fanfare as the nation confronts overlapping crises. While Biden has started to venture out more this week, the coronavirus pandemic has largely confined him to his Wilmington, Delaware, home for much of the past three months.  The country faces the worst rate of unemployment since the Great Depression. And civil unrest that harkens back to the 1960s has erupted in dozens of cities following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died when a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air.  It’s a confluence of events that no U.S. leader has faced in modern times, made all the more complicated by a president who has at times antagonized the protesters and is eager to take the fight to Biden.   Advertisement  “This is a difficult time in America’s history,” Biden said Friday night. “And Donald Trump’s angry, divisive politics is no answer. The country is crying out for leadership. Leadership that can unite us. Leadership that can bring us together.”  Biden spent 36 years in the Senate before becoming Barack Obama’s vice president. This is 77-year-old Biden’s third bid for the presidency and his success in capturing the Democratic nomination was driven by strong support from black voters.  He finished an embarrassing fourth place in the overwhelmingly white Iowa caucuses that kicked off the nomination process in February. Biden fared little better in the New Hampshire primary, where his standing was so low that he left the state before polls closed on election night to instead rally black voters in South Carolina.  His rebound began in the more diverse caucuses in Nevada but solidified in South Carolina, where Biden stomped Sanders, his nearest rival, by nearly 29 points. He followed that with a dominant showing three days later during the Super Tuesday contests, taking 10 of the 14 states.  Biden’s strong showing in states such as North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee and Texas reinforced his status as the preferred Democratic candidate of African American voters — but the relationship has not been without its strained moments. After a tense exchange with an influential black radio host, Biden took sharp criticism for suggesting that African American voters still deciding between him and Trump “ain’t black.”  That comment, and protests that have spread nationwide, have increased pressure on Biden to pick an African American running mate. He has already committed to picking a woman as a vice presidential candidate.   Advertisement  Black voters are unlikely to back Trump over Biden by a wide margin. A recent Fox News poll shows just 14% of African Americans who are registered to vote have a favorable opinion of the president compared with 75% who favorably view Biden.  But Biden must ensure that black voters are motivated to show up to the polls in November, especially in critical swing states that narrowly went for Trump in 2016.  At one point, the Democratic primary included dozens of candidates of different races, genders and generations and an openly gay man. The contest was dominated by debate over unapologetically progressive ideas, including fully government-funded health care under “Medicare for All” and a sweeping proposal to combat climate change known as the “Green New Deal.”  Biden prevailed by mostly offering more moderate approaches that he argued would make him more electable against Trump.  He refused to budge on his rejection of universal health care and some of the Green New Deal’s most ambitious provisions to combat climate change.  Since clinching the nomination, however, Biden has worked to build his appeal among progressives, forming joint task forces with Sanders’ campaign to find common ground on key issues like health care, the economy and the environment. Biden has also embraced a plan to forgive millions of Americans’ student debt, meaning that he clinches the nomination as easily the most liberal standard bearer the Democratic Party has ever had.  Biden’s embrace of his party’s left flank could help him consolidate a Democratic base that remained deeply divided after the 2016 primary and ultimately hurt Hillary Clinton in her defeat to Trump. But it could also undermine Biden’s attempts to rebuild the Obama coalition, which is often loosely defined as minorities and young people, as well as educated Americans and some working-class voters.  The former vice president has sought, since announcing his candidacy, to cast the election as a battle “for the soul of the nation,” and promised to restore order and dignity to the White House while rehabilitating the U.S. image on the world stage. Such an approach, though, necessarily focuses on being more of an alternative to Trump than offering radically new political ideas. And that further underscores Biden’s difficult task of trying to unite his party’s base while appealing to voters from far beyond it.  “I am going to spend every day between now and November 3rd fighting to earn the votes of Americans all across this great country,” Biden promised Friday, “so that, together, we can win the battle for the soul of this nation, and make sure that as we rebuild our economy, everyone comes along.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 18, "positive": 42, "negative": 21, "disgust": 1, "joy": 1, "anger": 15, "surprise": 6, "fear": 7, "trust": 11}, "metadata": ["washington", "joe", "biden", "formally", "democratic", "presidential", "donald", "trump", "unprecedented", "economic", "election", "united", "leader", "bernie", "campaign", "nominee", "primaries", "convention", "coronavirus", "pandemic", "george", "senate", "iowa", "rally", "super", "american", "influential", "protests", "poll", "ensure", "progressive", "climate", "economy", "ultimately", "rebuild", "obama", "restore", "radically"]}, {"text": "In a piece for The Atlantic this Monday, Yasmeen Sethan argues that the 2010s was the decade where populism surged around the world and predominantly far-right parties “permeated the political mainstream.” But according to Sethan, the 2020s will the decade there people see the consequences of those policies.  “The decade brought us the election of Donald Trump in the United States and the Brexit vote in Britain,” Sethan writes. “It witnessed the rise of the Alternative for Germany—the first far-right party to enter the country’s national parliament in decades—as well as the ascent of populist parties in countries such as Austria, Brazil, Italy, India, Indonesia, and Poland. By 2018, as many as 20 populist leaders held executive office around the world.”   ADVERTISEMENT  “If the 2010s were the years in which predominantly far-right, populist parties permeated the political mainstream, then the 2020s will be when voters ‘are going to see the consequences of that,’ Daphne Halikiopoulou, an associate professor of comparative politics at the University of Reading, in England, told me,” she continued. “In some ways, they already have. In Britain, the 2016 vote to leave the European Union—and the political fallout it caused—is likely to be fulfilled at the end of January, following Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s resounding victory in last month’s general election. Elsewhere, populist parties have already made their impact—if not through passing legislation at the head of government, then by applying pressure in opposition.”  “Whereas much of the past decade revolved around arguments over issues of immigration and sovereignty, the 2020s could be dominated by a new, more pressing narrative: climate change,” writes Sethan.

That’s right. On Wednesday evening, I will forgo my pandemic ritual of shaking out a Grey Goose elixir — straight up, bone dry, tundra cold, lemon twist — before slaving over a hot stove for the little hellions. Alcohol causes a lot of problems in society. I can’t sit by and stay silent on Wednesday.  What’s that? Thursday? No, on Thursday, I will resurrect Happy Hour. What are you, insane? The kids go back to school on Thursday. If anything, I may need two martinis. Fine. Three!  My sacrifice comes with a stopwatch. My principled stand is to not exceed 86,400 seconds.  You know, like the celebrities — Kim Kardashian! Katy Perry! Leonardo DiCaprio! Sacha Baron Cohen! — who are boycotting social media by not posting on Wednesday. As Kardashian wrote to her 188 million Instagram followers: “I love that I can connect directly with you through Instagram and Facebook, but I can’t sit by and stay silent while these platforms continue to allow the spreading of hate, propaganda and misinformation — created by groups to sow division and split America apart — only to take steps after people are killed.  “Misinformation shared on social media has a serious impact on our elections and undermines our democracy. Please join me tomorrow (Wednesday) when I will be ‘freezing’ my Instagram and FB account to tell Facebook to #StopHateForProfit.”  She’s not wrong. The misinformation and conspiracy theories that have plunged swaths of Facebook into cognitive shooting ranges, where blasts of semi-automatic lies leave bullet holes in the minds of gullible dingbats, is a big problem. I have “friends” who actually believe Antifa set the forest fires now raging across the West Coast or that a cabal of globalist Satanists gulp the blood of children under direct orders of George Soros or Bill Gates. There are a startling number of lunatics among us who believe Wayfair is a front for sex trafficking and pedophilia.  Hey, I ordered an armoire and a naked eight-year-old was inside!  But I need a martini after reading the first line in Kardashian’s bio on Instagram (which Facebook owns), right above her protest post this week: “Shop @SKIMS Maternity Solutionwear™ on Thursday, 09.17 at 9AM PT.”  So she and other celebrity activists are against social-media companies profiting from alleged hate while they themselves profit from these same social-media companies they allegedly hate? Right. The hypocrisy is more dizzying than the Dragon Fyre at Canada’s Wonderland.  It’s like these celebrities are saying, “Due to climate change, I will not use a private jet on Saturday.” And then on Sunday, they board a Gulfstream G200 because, come on, how else are they supposed to get to that luxury superyacht in the Mediterranean that’s stocked with caviar and foie gras?  ONE DAY? Really, Kim Kardashian? You can only commit to laying off evil social media for ONE DAY? My God, 99 per cent of everyone who has ever made a doomed New Year’s Resolution made it to at least three days before they returned to chain smoking or pounding back Krispy Kreme. My wife is a staunch environmentalist who researches every product that enters this house. I can only imagine her reaction if I told her I planned to not use a shampoo that was tested on animals for ONE DAY before lathering my skull with said shampoo the other six days of the week.  I’d need an eco-conditioner specially formulated for head trauma.  If anyone, celebrity or otherwise, really believes social media is corrosive to democracy, there is one logical corrective: stop using social media. Delete your account. Do not voluntarily join a treacherous ecosystem. If I believed, say, jogging was bad for humanity, I sure as hell wouldn’t be hanging out at Foot Locker every day. That would make no sense.  But the celebrities participating in Wednesday’s #StopHateForProfit don’t seem to realize how this “boycott” is a pointless exercise in performative gesturing that is as empty as my bottle of Grey Goose. There was a Forbes story last year that noted Cristiano Ronaldo now makes more money from social media than he does from soccer. Think about that. Or how about this: Kim Kardashian can earn upwards of $1 million for one sponsored post. Yeah. In about 30 seconds, she can rake in more dough than a teacher or prison guard will make in a decade. It’s bananas.  That’s why #StopHateForProfit is such a farce: the celebrity anti-haters are the lead profiteers!  This ONE DAY break from social media is like a KKK Grand Wizard boasting about not using the N-word one Tuesday. If these celebrities really believe Facebook and Instagram are undermining democracy, then aren’t they complicit by staying on these platforms as so-called influencers?  Loading... Loading...

But since these celebrities can’t or won’t pull the plug on social media, we can only assume financial gain is more important than social harmony and justice.

Some are emitting gut-wrenching, primal sounds that are a cross between a newborn baby and a mewling kitten.

Clearly, it’s a sign to just enjoy the seals and not worry about getting a “sealfie.”  As the 20-odd guests fan out to observe other baby seals, I park myself near a captivating mother-and-child duo. This writhing baby seal reminds me of that stage when human babies roll over, lie on their bellies and lift their heads but can’t coordinate sitting or crawling. Mama seal, a plump beauty with splotchy grey-brown skin, shoots me a few dirty looks but otherwise tolerates me marvelling at her impressive spawn.  Thanks to the Château Madelinot, which runs these harp seal nursery trips, I’m well versed in the Canadian Marine Mammal Regulations connected to this “seal fishery observation.” No touching or feeding these wild animals, stay 30 feet from adults because they can be aggressive, and never walk between a mom and pup. Don’t wander off alone and beware of thin or black ice, cracks, pressure peaks and open water. The Mustang survival suits will help us float and stave off hypothermia if we fall in, but we are 45 minutes from shore.  Les Îles-de-la-Madeleine is an archipelago of about a dozen islands, including six that are linked by long, thin sand dunes. Known as the Magdalen Islands or the “Maggies,” they’re a short plane ride east of Quebec City or a five-hour ferry north from Prince Edward Island. The archipelago is home to about 12,500 mainly French-speaking residents. That number swells to 30,000 in the summer. A salt mine produces road salt, but fishing and tourism are top industries. There are restaurants, museums, boutiques, a small shopping mall, brewery, fish smokehouse and cheesemaker here, but the real draws are white sand beaches, whale-watching trips and water activities.  The Château Madelinot has hosted baby seal trips for nearly 40 years, ever since guests heard about the newborns and asked to see them. The top market is Japan because Japanese wildlife photographer Rei Ohara has been coming for decades and has published multiple photo books, and because the popular anime TV show Shounen Ashibe follows the life of a kid and his pet seal Goma-chan.  “People want to come and see the real Goma-chan,” explains the hotel’s communications director Ariane Bérubé, whose business card includes an Ohara photo of her kneeling beside a baby seal. “We are the only ones in the world doing this.”  Fisheries and Oceans Canada says a “healthy and abundant” population of 7.4 million harp seals lives in the Northwest Atlantic. The seals summer in the Canadian Arctic and Greenland. They migrate south every fall and separate into three herds in either the Gulf of St. Lawrence or the waters off Newfoundland and Labrador to breed and give birth on the ice.  The Gulf herd, which breeds near the Magdalen Islands, numbers in the tens of thousands.  Adults are big— about 5 feet long and 285 to 330 pounds — and typically live 25 to 40 years. Females spend the entire year pregnant and give birth on stable sea ice between late February and mid-March. Newborns weigh about 24 pounds and get just 12 days of breastfeeding before the moms abandon them to mate and repeat the cycle.  The proper French word for seal is phoque. (Go ahead, make your dirty jokes.) But most Francophones call them loups marins (sea wolves), a nod to the fact these voracious predators feed on shrimp, prawns, crustaceans and fish.  Those haunting cries I heard on the ice were probably hungry moans.  Sometimes there are hundreds or thousands of baby seals on the ice. My trip is just days into the season and so there are only a handful that we have to share—and they are spread out. People race from seal to seal, but I move away from the mom and baby and over to a yellowish newborn who’s on its own while mom bobs in the water. The baby’s white fur has a yellow hue because it’s still tinged with amniotic fluid. I spot a bloody umbilical cord frozen in the snow.  National Geographic just declared trips to the Magdalen Islands for seal pup observation one of the best 25 trips to take in 2020, either by helicopter day trip or live-aboard boat expedition. But it’s important to be mindful of climate change.  The Château Madelinot’s 2010 season was cancelled because an extended warm front dramatically diminished ice formation in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and made it unsafe for the helicopters to safely land. The 2011, 2016 and 2017 seasons were also wiped out due to strong winds and above-average temperatures. Now the hotel makes sure guests understand that wildlife experiences can never be guaranteed. It sells three- and six-night packages—to boost the odds of everybody getting out once to see the seals—and doesn’t ask for deposits. You pay when you arrive.  The hotel has 116 rooms but limits the seal observation trips to 150 guests. The 2020 season ran from Feb. 22 to March 10 with all-inclusive packages for one person starting at $2,100 U.S. for three nights. Reservations for next year will open in July.  When the stars align, the helicopters make three, three-hour excursions a day, travelling together to be safe. It takes us about 45 minutes to fly to the patch of ice deemed large and stable enough to land on. Canadian Helicopters pilot Alex Villeneuve gets us back to the hotel safely, but the next flight is cancelled as a storm sweeps in. Ditto all three flights the next day.  I chat up Hiroshi Takenawa, a tourist from Tokyo, as we wiggle out of our survival suits.  “The babies are very cute,” Takenawa enthuses, before correcting himself. “They’re not simply cute—they were too cute for me. I was almost crying.” I don’t have the heart to tell him the babies will surely die when the coming storm destroys their icy homes.  Takenawa has dreamed about this trip for five years after seeing Ohara’s photos on the internet. He has already been to Yellowknife, Northwest Territories for the northern lights and Banff, Alberta to see the mountains, but says this Quebec trip tops both those Canadian experiences.  I suspect Takenawa won’t dig any deeper than just the warm, fuzzy, harp seal nursery outing, but I’m here to find out what seals really mean to islanders.  It’s a few days too soon for Rendez-Vous Loup Marin, a nine-day festival that includes seal-inspired films and the sale of croxignoles (braided donuts fried in seal fat that I will have to try another time). So it’s off to two museums that celebrate the island’s complicated history with seals.  Centre d’interprétation du phoque (Seal Interpretation Center) owner Robert St-Onge explains that seals have been hunted here for hundreds of years. The winter hunt—both commercial and subsistence—is regulated with permits and quotas.  It has been illegal to hunt newborn “whitecoats” since 1987. It’s also illegal to hunt on the seal breeding/whelping grounds. Hunters do target seals that have been weaned, just as lamb and veal come from animals that are just weeks or months old.  Seal, explains museum guide Vanessa Ouellet, was once “a survival meat” and the only available winter protein. Now supermarkets offer all the usual proteins, but many locals want to keep seal culinary traditions alive.  Upstairs at the interpretation center, there’s a display celebrating local seal specialties plus a small fishing boat, gear used for sealing and details about how the Omega-3-rich food, oil, leather and fur sustained generations.  There’s even a corner devoted to the painful time when French actress/animal activist Brigitte Bardot came with Greenpeace in 1977 to challenge the seal hunt and was photographed with a whitecoat. Sir Paul McCartney, the billionaire ex-Beatle, and his then wife Heather came in 2006, famously described the hunt as a “stain on the Canadian people” and suggested that commercial sealers find other ways to earn a living. They, too, posed with whitecoats, perpetuating the myth that the photogenic newborns are hunted.  As the anti-sealing momentum built, the European Union banned the commercial trade of seal products in 2009. It was a devastating blow to the Inuit who have long hunted, eaten and worn seal in the northern Canadian territory of Nunavut, as well as to Newfoundland and Quebec sealers.  “Thirty years ago, and everyone on the planet said `You are bad people,’” remembers Ouellet, pointing to a photo of Bardot among a collage of newspaper headlines and editorial cartoons calling the Islanders butchers.  At Musée de la Mer (Museum of the Sea), the focus is on the fisheries and early island life, but there is some talk of seals and a culinary exhibit that details “the seal on our plate,” with photos of charcuterie and local quotes. Some people eat it and some don’t, admits Alissa Brunetti, project manager for Le Bon Goût Frais des Îles de la Madeleine, which put the exhibit together to celebrate local food traditions.  “I eat it because it tastes great (and for fritters in seal oil), and to support our hunters,” reads one quote.  “To me it tastes like 50% red meat and 50% fish,” reads another. “Like fish with an aftertaste of beef blood. Not my thing.”  “I would eat it more often if I knew how to cook it properly,” laments another islander. “Let’s just say there are not that many recipes you can google.”  Which brings us to Réjean Vigneau of Boucherie Spécialisée Côte à Côte. He has a special commercial license to harvest and butcher seals and is a pro at removing unpleasant tasting fat from the lean, dark red meat. “If you don’t take it off, it will destroy the quality of the meat.”  Vigneau transforms local and Newfoundland seal into steaks, brochettes and jerky plus sausage, pâté and rillettes (shredded meat slow cooked in fat), often adding fatty pork to make things more palatable. A poster at his shop details all the cuts of a seal, just like the charts you see for beef, pork or lamb.  I spot Vigneau’s seal products in the local supermarket, and try his burger dressed up with smoked duck, local cheese, Dijon sauce, lettuce and tomatoes at Les Pas Perdus restaurant. I desperately want to love it but have to admit it’s a little too pungent and unfamiliar even for me. I much preferred the time a Greenlandic Inuit woman “flensed” a seal on cardboard on the ground in her fishing village and let me sample raw heart and blubber. And I loved the intense meat when a friend brought me frozen Magdalen seal steaks and I pan-seared them just a shade past rare and smothered them with a sour cherry and honey sauce.  When seal pops up occasionally on Canadian restaurants menus, tempers flare, protests launch and it’s impossible to explain to urbanites what seals mean to the Inuit in northern Canada and to others in Newfoundland and Labrador and the Magdalen Islands who have long hunted it, eaten it and used its fur for clothing.  When I leave the Magdalens, it’s with a wheel of artisan cheese and not with frozen seal meat. Fromagerie du Pied-de-Vent, which creates artisan cheese from local cow milk, makes a mild, Camembert-like cheese named Jeune-Coeur to honour young harp seals. Its label shows two whitecoats frolicking on the ice with the Magdalens looming in the background.  The Chateau Madelinot only sells seal stuffies, pillows and paintings during the baby seal photo safari season. At Atelier Cōtier, Pauline-Gervaise Grēgoire sells seal-shaped fridge magnets and tic-tac-toe sculptures with black and white seals, both made of hardened sand. These are good options for Americans who can’t bring seal products home under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.  But for Canadians, and others who face no such restrictions, gift shops at both of the island’s museums sell gorgeous hats and mittens made by Rachel Drouin Création with sealskin accents.  It was “love at first sight” when the artist discovered seal and started incorporating it into things like headbands, jewelry, bags, wallets and slippers. “I have the pleasure of working with an inspiring, available, abundant and local material to make unique and sustainable products that suit our climate,” enthuses Drouin. “The Madelinots are proud to wear seal products and they are, for me, precious ambassadors.”  Not everyone that comes to these little-known Quebec islands for a once-in-a-lifetime baby seal experience will be comfortable discovering that seal is also hunted, eaten and worn here, but I came prepared to learn and understand. I head home with three of Drouin’s pieces, a wheel of cheese, a whack of safari photos and memories, and a richer understanding of the complex emotions that seals trigger.

On Tuesday BP underlined its belief in the exploration potential of the North Sea as it announced that it had returned to profit in the third quarter.  The giant included its successful bid for new North Sea exploration licences in a list of highlights for the three months to 30 September.  BP submitted the bids for the relevant licences before the first wave of the coronavirus triggered a plunge in oil and gas prices that has already taken a heavy toll on activity in the North Sea.  However, the decision to refer to the licences in the results last week suggests the company’s opinion of the acreage has not changed as a result of the coronavirus.  The new boss of BP’s North Sea division, Emeka Emembolu, said last month that the North Sea remained a core area for the firm.  On Thursday last week Royal Dutch Shell announced that the UK North Sea was one of nine basins that it has decided to focus on. Around 20 other areas did not make it into the grouping.  Shell’s boss Ben van Beurden also confirmed that the company expects to remain in the oil and gas business for years.  The comments on the North Sea by Shell and BP may have helped allay concerns about the prospects for the North Sea as the industry grapples with challenges on a range of fronts.  Both Shell and BP have announced big changes in strategy as they bid to reinvent themselves amid the drive to help slow climate change.As they plan to increase investment in renewables significantly while making big enough payouts to investors to keep them onside, their oil and gas budgets will come under pressure.  Some might have worried that the North Sea would struggle to retain BP and Shell’s interest when other majors have made clear they see better prospects in other areas, such as US shale fields.  But any boost to sentiment resulting from BP and Shell’s comments will be tempered by memories of the impact of the last downturn.  After oil prices plunged sharply from 2014 to 2016 as growth in supplies ran ahead of demand Shell and BP retrenched in the North Sea. They sold what were deemed to be non-core assets and shed hundreds of jobs.  The disposal programmes left them with a smaller footprint in the North Sea focused on a few favoured areas.  BP is still in the process of rationalising its North Sea portfolio. The company agreed in January to sell stakes in two big fields to Premier Oil for $625m then accepted a cut in the cash price after the oil price tanked.  Premier subsequently shelved the deal after agreeing to merge with Chrysaor leaving BP wondering what to do with the assets.  BP and Shell’s remaining North Sea portfolios are concentrated in a few areas in which they see most potential, such as West of Shetland.  Any future growth could involve relatively small developments close to existing facilities, which may only result in slim pickings for the supply chain.  Barring a big improvement in market conditions, the prospect of Shell or BP exploring in new areas of the North Sea or investing in the kind of large-scale developments required to open them up seems remote.  The outlook for the market, however, has worsened markedly in recent days.  The price of Brent crude fell from around $70 per barrel in January to an 18-year low of less than $16 per barrel in April after coronavirus lockdowns hammered demand and Russia and Saudi Arabia indulged in a price war.  The price rallied to around $45 after some lockdown measures were eased and major exporters, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, agreed to big production cuts.  However, it has been on an increasingly clear downward trend since late September amid signs a second wave of the coronavirus is engulfing the world. Brent crude sold for around $38/bbl yesterday afternoon.  After completing deep cost cutting in response to the last downturn, some firms may be able to make good money on their existing production in the North Sea at $35/bbl. Whether they will be ready to sanction the investments the supply chain is crying out for is an entirely different matter.

Cartoonists, noticing the myriad connections between such spending and the issues plaguing our nation, have used their craft to highlight how big money corrupts our democracy, advances warfare, furthers climate change and, in general, drowns out the will of the American people.  American Promise is leading the cross-partisan movement for a 28th Amendment to get big money out of politics. Each week on this post, we will share assets from our newsletter, including the featured cartoon and articles covering the movement for the amendment.  One big lesson from the election: America remains the land of the free and the home of the brave. Braving a dangerous pandemic, adapting to new voting schedules and long lines, participating in remote and socially distanced campaigns, and staring down fear, uncertainty and crisis, at least 160 million Americans cast our ballots in one of the closest elections in history.  Hundreds of thousands of new poll workers volunteered and, while Americans across the nation in every state and community waited peacefully (if anxiously), our ballots were dutifully and carefully counted. We congratulate President-Elect Joe Biden (a longtime champion of our constitutional amendment) and Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris (an American Promise pledge signer) on their election. And we congratulate all of the candidates of all parties who stepped up to run for office and offer their ideas and service.  You might find this slide deck from Bruce Mehlman to be an insightful recap of the election and state of the electorate. As Bruce details, more money than ever poured into this election—$14 billion in the federal elections alone. And despite the surge of small contributions, most of the money still is driven by the huge spenders, some of whom surpassed $100 million in individual contributions (as always, Open Secrets has the data).  Three key takeaways for all of us at American Promise:  First, Americans know election spending is out of control. As one Maine newspaper editorial described it after the Senate race there passed $200 million, when billions of dollars are spent to make people afraid, angry, divided and partisan, people will be afraid, angry, divided and partisan.  Second, we are right about our constitutional amendment for reasonable spending limits to empower voters, make representatives responsive to the people, and secure free speech for every American. With more than 400 candidates signing the American Promise pledge and cross-partisan support ranging from 70% to 80%, we are on track to win.  Finally, the election results once again demonstrate that neither major party alone is going to deliver real and lasting solutions. Our cross-partisan, citizen-driven approach is the key to success.  Americans are not giving up. We will move through this extraordinary and challenging time to win reform and renew our country together. Thank you for your commitment and good work.  After Divisive Election, a Key Takeaway: Majority of Americans Agree It’s Time to Limit Money in Politics  Fighting for Our Nation—Once Again  With advance voting and voting-by-mail happening now in many states before Election Day on November 3, we at American Promise are working with our partners in Fix the System to ensure that all American citizens can vote safely, and that every vote is counted according to law. This year’s election process may have some bumps and delays, which make it vital that we maintain our belief in our democratic process and practice peace and patience in the days following the election.  Throughout this election season and beyond, we will continue our work for equal representation for all. One way we do this is by encouraging candidates to sign the American Promise Candidate Pledge to advance the amendment to reduce the influence of money in politics. After they’re elected, we must continue our outreach to encourage these supporters to make this issue a top priority in the new Congress.  While this year’s events have exposed systemic failures and created hardships for many people, they also serve as a reminder of the value of our vote, the importance of working toward American equality, and the critical necessity of free and fair elections. We urge you to uphold the foundation of our democracy by voting in person if you are able and, if not, voting by mail or in advance.  With questions over how and where Americans can vote amid a global pandemic, the upcoming election is a referendum not only on the offices on the ballot, but on democracy itself. With record voter interest and record campaign spending — projected at $11 billion — it’s clear what’s at stake: a battle between the voices of the people and a powerful plutocracy that seeks to control the narrative, regardless of which side of the party line we fall on.  In the face of this growing fragility in our representative democracy, voting in this election is more important than ever before. By voting, we cast not only our ballot for our elected officials, but also assert the power of our voices as the driver of our democracy. That’s why the team at American Promise urges you and your family members and friends to check your state’s vote-by-mail status and your registration before Election Day on November 3. With partner organizations, we are working to ensure that every American can vote safely in their state while also protecting public health.  As we move forward with our election-related work through the candidate pledge campaign, state-based strategies, and cross-partisan platform, we counsel peace and patience for what may be a longer vote count following Election Day. Our votes are still the most powerful force in our representative democracy despite the escalating influence of big money in our elections. This election year, be sure to claim your political voice, cast a ballot, and represent the values of equality and liberty that our democracy is founded upon.  Voting in Times of a National Crisis  “If there was one decision I would overrule, it would be Citizens United. I think the notion that we have all the democracy that money can buy strays so far from what our democracy is supposed to be.”  — The late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in a 2014 New Republic interview on Citizens United v. FEC, which ruled that corporations could fund political speech under the First Amendment  As our nation honors the life and legacy of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, we at American Promise are especially grateful for her steadfast years of work for equality, the value that drives our work and strengthens our efforts. With equality as the ultimate goal of the 28th Amendment — ensuring a voice for all Americans — Justice Ginsburg’s lifelong work is relevant inspiration to realize our nation’s promise of human liberty, equal citizenship, and effective self-government.  This year the Democratic Citizens Commission of the Academy of Arts and Science issued a challenge to reinvent democracy for the 21st century; one of its key recommendations was to pass the American Promise amendment to end the dominance of big money in politics. We are stepping up to this challenge—our new report, Keep the Promise: America 250, shares how we intend to succeed in bringing Americans together across the political spectrum to pass this amendment and ensure a better future for every American.  Over the past several years, American Promise and our network and allies have been working on proposed amendment language that will garner the cross-partisan support we need in both houses of Congress. We have based this language on consensus derived through listening sessions with Americans from across the nation, through a variety of programs. We’re still gathering feedback, and we hope you’ll weigh in via our survey.  Justice Ginsburg never swayed from her determination to protect constitutional rights for all Americans. We hope to honor her by continuing the work toward a more perfect union and passing the 28th Amendment to the Constitution by July 4, 2026, our nation’s 250th birthday.  Progress Amid Challenges: Consensus Builds for the 28th Amendment  The corruptive effects of unlimited political spending are cropping up in states across the country, with untraceable dark money spending surging in state elections in the decade since Citizens United.  In Maine, national political action committees and donors outside the state are pouring record amounts of money into the U.S. Senate race between incumbent Republican Susan Collins and challenger Sara Gideon.  In Ohio and Illinois, multimillion-dollar bribery and corruption political-spending scandals have led to criminal charges against elected officials.  In Alaska, political spending from undisclosed sources grew from 6% to more than 60% from 2006 to 2014, which is why Alaskans have come together to push forward a ballot initiative to increase transparency and make the state the 21st to formally call on Congress for the 28th Amendment.  Two common threads underlie these and similar situations in states nationwide: Ultra-wealthy special interests looking to sway policy and gain favors through political spending; and citizen-led movements in these same states demanding an end to this corrupt system through the 28th Amendment.  Jeff Clements: Big-Dollar Bribery Cases Highlight Need for Reform  Pete Dufour: It’s Time for Maine Candidates to Stand with Maine Small Businesses  As the new Empowerment Director for American Promise, it is Dr. Jessica Hare’s vision and mission to empower all Americans to come together for the ratification of the 28th Amendment. Our nation is facing an array of challenges, and we the American people can and will bring positive change to our political climate. As we embark upon the 2020 election season, it is important to understand that Americans across our nation have the power to decide on the quality of life we want for ourselves and future generations. Reaching out to elected officials and exercising our right to vote offer a chance to advocate against social injustice.  Right now Americans want to feel empowered while understanding how to execute their rights as citizens. Americans can hold elected officials accountable and collectively end how big money continues to dominate our political climate. We at American Promise will continue to uplift Americans, while valuing their dignity and worth. In the words of the late and great James Baldwin: “Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.”  As your new Empowerment Director, Dr. Hare challenges you to take a stance. Let’s bring about change by advocating for the ratification of the 28th Amendment.  Nina Turner: Don’t Lose Faith in the Work We’re Doing  Peter Schwartz: Far-Sighted Business Leaders Should Support the 28th Amendment  Ask Your Elected Officials: Do You Represent Big Money or We the People?  A century ago, America was in a period of transition following World War I, the 1918 flu pandemic, and riots during “Red Summer” in cities across the country. Amid this era of change and conflict that also saw record economic growth and rapid technological advances, America ratified the 19th Amendment guaranteeing white women the right to vote—after nearly 100 years of work toward the cause.  As our nation currently faces societal challenges that make it easy to focus on our differences, it’s vital to recall the founding promise of our nation—equality—and realize where we share common ground. As the late U.S. Rep. John Lewis urged in his final article: “Continue to build union between movements stretching across the globe.”  This newsletter highlights that common ground and the cross-partisan nature of American Promise, from the recent monthly call on the Conservative Case to Get Money Out to the launch of our National Business Network to recent American Promise Candidate Pledge successes in communities across the country.  We’re also glad to introduce two new American Promise team members, Communications Coordinator Zyeisha Allen and Empowerment Director Dr. Jessica Hare, who bring professional expertise, personal passions, and a shared belief in the power of our grassroots, people-powered movement for the 28th Amendment.  The Conservative Case: Why the 28th Amendment Has Support Across the Political Spectrum  Tennessee Volunteer Finds Hope in the 28th Amendment—and Success Focusing on the Candidate Pledge  Meet the Newest American Promise Team Members: Zyeisha Allen and Dr. Jessica Hare  While progress is rarely linear, events along the way serve as turning points. The Voting Rights Act (VRA) of 1965, which marks its 55th anniversary on August 6, is one of those points. When it became law, the VRA boosted Black voter turnout and provided a legal framework to challenge voting restrictions in places where it wasn’t enforced.  But as the current racial justice movement shows us, there is still much progress to be made regarding equality in America. In the 2013 Shelby County vs. Holder case, the Supreme Court swept away a key provision of the VRA, opening the floodgates to laws restricting voting across the United States. Since the Shelby case, states previously covered by the VRA have engaged in significant efforts to disenfranchise voters, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.  Throughout history, it has been the American people who have continued the work toward equality for all—many times through the amendment process. Equality is at the core of the American Promise movement, which works to ensure a voice and representation for every American through an amendment to establish reasonable limits on money in politics so that our nation’s policies work better for all. Through our grassroots, nationwide movement, we can continue to advance widespread reforms to ensure that all Americans have the voice and vote they deserve.  Cheryl Clyburn Crawford: How the Right to Vote and the 28th Amendment Together Ensure a Voice for All Americans  Accepting the Challenge to Empower Voters and Ensure Equality  Clements: Why the 28th Amendment Is a Critical Fix for America’s Political System  The 2020 election will happen amid an array of seismic forces—a public health crisis, an economic recession, a rising racial justice movement. One constant force is the nature of our American democracy, with elections at its center. While we each can wield significant power through our voice and our vote, the domination of concentrated wealth in our elections dilutes the power of our votes by incentivizing our elected officials to be more responsive to the wealthy few.  Right now Americans across the country are using their voices to reach out to candidates and elected officials, asking them to sign the American Promise Candidate Pledge and take a stand against elite special interests who buy influence by pouring money into our political system. Through this growing grassroots effort, volunteers are spreading the word about the 28th Amendment and paving the way for real change in our political system. We also highlight the story of Hal Gurian, an American Promise volunteer-turned-candidate who is running for a seat on the Grand Traverse County Commission in Michigan and promising to advance the 28th Amendment by signing the Candidate Pledge.  Americans across the country are calling on election officials to ensure they can vote safely this fall—at least 10 states have moved to make voting by mail easier in November, and five GOP governors are joining the call for mail-in voting expansions in response to the pandemic. By also making support for the 28th Amendment a voting issue, we further support the power of our votes as the most essential feature of our representative democracy.  From Advocacy to Candidacy: Republican American Promise Volunteer Aims to Represent We the People  Jeff Clements on the FOMO Sapiens Podcast  A Passion for Independence: An Alaskan Shares Why the 49th State May Be the 21st to Call for the 28th Amendment  The 28th Amendment and ‘Irrepressible Conflict’: Equal Citizens or Oligarchy?  As we prepare to celebrate America’s 244th birthday, the need for systemic change is more evident than ever if we hope to live up to our nation’s founding aspirations—an equal right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all people.  Amid this year’s celebration, a global pandemic and a growing racial justice movement highlight the unrealized promise of equality, and a dysfunctional democracy reflects the outsized influence of wealthy political donors rather than we the people.  But together, Americans can step up to the challenges we face and work together to reinvent a democracy that will work for our future. In the links below we highlight just a few of the many people joining in this work in communities across the country, heeding the call to create a more inclusive, effective democracy through crucial reforms—including the American Promise Amendment—outlined recently by the Commission on the Practice of Democratic Citizenship.  This 4th of July, Americans are stepping up to say #ChallengeAccepted to ensure a strong and inclusive democracy for our next 244 years. We are proud to join them.  Racial Justice, Economic Justice, and Money in Politics  Devin Hiett: The 28th Amendment Will Empower Young Americans  Renaldo Pearson Accepts His Citizen Leader Award   Donor Spotlight: John Boynton  American Promise exists to achieve political equality for all Americans. As our nation continues to witness horrific displays of systemic racism as well as moments of unity and hope, American Promise works to build the movement for an amendment to provide equal representation regardless of wealth—so that all citizens have a voice in the decisions that shape our everyday lives.  The success of our movement depends on actions taken by Americans across the political spectrum who are committed to ushering in a reinvented democracy for the 21st century. By connecting and empowering citizens across the country to advocate for the amendment, we strengthen our movement and our nation’s capacity to move forward together.  This week our newsletter highlights several calls for equality: from American Promise Advisory Council member Nina Turner, Bernie Sanders 2020 national campaign co-chair and former Ohio state senator; from the Commission on the Practice of Democratic Citizenship in its vision for the 21st century; and in Juneteenth events occurring in coming days across the country.  Heed these calls to action. Now is the time to rely on our strength, spirit and the collective power of millions of small acts to advance real, permanent change. Together we have the power to move toward our nation’s fundamental and unfulfilled promise of equality for all.  The Time for Equality is Now  American Promise Amendment Among Top Reforms in Commission’s Call for a More Resilient Democracy  Meet Corinne Noonan: Working to End Corporate Domination of Politics  Events Across the U.S.—Online and In Person—Will Celebrate Juneteenth  We are a democracy in crisis. The past few decades have seen our country moving steadily toward oligarchy, where the wealthiest and most powerful among us control the decisions that affect our lives and the promise of equality for all has still not been met. These past weeks and days we are also reminded—if we needed reminding—that the evil of racism that has ever been intertwined with our national journey is one of the most powerful forces holding America back. As Jeff Clements, American Promise president, shared in his message earlier this week, this is not a “distraction” from our goal; this is our goal: an America where we do not abuse power to lock out, silence and destroy our fellow Americans.  Even amid seemingly insurmountable challenges and conflict in the past, Americans have never given up. We won’t give up now. Alongside the recent atrocities we have also seen Americans coming together, feeling a renewed sense that we are all in this together.  Equality serves as the basis for our goal at American Promise: to ensure every American has an equal voice. Right now that goal is more urgent than ever. Next week the American Academy of Arts & Science’s Commission on the Practice of Democratic Citizenship will launch its blueprint for how we can strengthen America’s institutions and civic culture in six strategies to improve the resilience of our democracy. In doing so, the Commission has issued a bold challenge for all Americans to meet their vision of a common purpose to reinvent democracy for the 21st century.  We accept the challenge. The American Promise Amendment we are winning together is a central pillar of the vision of a more resilient democracy. Thanks to you and so many Americans, we will secure equal rights and equal opportunities for all in America, and we will treat all Americans as we want to be treated.   America’s Broken Heart  Our Common Purpose: The Challenge of Reinventing American Democracy for the 21st Century  The numbers tell the story of the U.S. economy for the last two months: More than 100,000 small businesses lost. Retail sales down nearly 18%. More than 36 million unemployed.  These numbers also show how the economic fallout from the pandemic is hitting small businesses that often serve as the heart of our communities. Neighborhood restaurants, art galleries, bookstores, and other shops now are facing uncertain futures due to a pay-to-play system favoring large corporations and special interests that influence policy with big-dollar political donations.  While global crises like the COVID-19 pandemic are difficult to plan for, a distorted economic system that fosters pay-to-play politics and enables big corporations to use their political influence to push their way to the front of the line also hinders the way our economy manages and recovers from crises.  That is among the reasons why business leaders from across the country, with experience in small, midsize and large corporate businesses, are all coming together as part of the Business for American Promise network to advance an amendment that will level the playing field and encourage innovation and create an environment for long-term economic growth. To further amplify the voices of these citizens—including the 58 million-plus Americans who work at small and midsize businesses—we are uniting socially responsible business leaders in nonpartisan advocacy for the 28th Amendment.  We’re thrilled to see more business leaders making an impact by signing the Statement of Principle for Business Professionals, including Peter Schwartz, an internationally renowned futurist and business strategist, whose article reminds us to envision an economy where the rules apply to everyone rather than benefit the ultra-wealthy. As Peter says, “today’s rules of the political game make it impossible for either government or business to take the long view,” instead rewarding short-term decisions that weaken the marketplace and our democracy.  Especially now, when most business owners are dealing with plenty of unexpected challenges, we’re heartened to have Peter and numerous other business leaders join our movement to create an economy where companies compete based on the value they create in America’s marketplace.  Taking the Long View in a Crisis: It’s Time to Fix the Rules So the Future has a Voice  See the Business Leaders Joining the Movement for Limits on Political Spending by Signing the Statement of Principle  Watch: Business for American Promise Leaders Share How Companies and Investors Can Restore Trust in Democracy  In recent weeks, daily life has changed for all of us—and while we each are affected, the less fortunate among us once again are suffering the greatest impacts.  Whether it’s witnessing the large corporations with lobbying budgets scooping up the majority of government “small business” aid or seeing videos of wealthy Americans at home in mansions while fast food workers can choose to risk their health by working or join the millions of unemployed Americans, the way the system is designed to benefit the wealthy few is on stark display.  This is why we are a part of this movement. By passing an amendment, we get at the root of these issues by ending the Supreme Court-sanctioned ability of the wealthiest among us to buy undue influence over the systems that affect all of our daily lives.  Despite these frustrations and the many issues brought to light by the pandemic, our movement continues to achieve huge victories. Last month in Wisconsin, 17 more communities joined the call for an amendment thanks to the efforts of citizen leaders with Wisconsin United to Amend—bringing the total to more than 160 Wisconsin communities that have done so.  Now is the time to continue building momentum and demanding our elected officials stand with us. In the first convening of our new Citizen Leaders Book Club, we’ll hear from Neal Simon, author of Contract to Unite America: Ten Reforms to Reclaim Our Republic. Neal’s firsthand experience with big money in politics as a candidate for Congress motivated him to become an advocate for democracy reform, including the American Promise Amendment. Join us for an online call at 8 p.m. ET Monday, May 11.  As we come together to face the current crisis and move toward the November elections, our work to elevate the voice and power of we the people holds more importance and promise than ever. Together we can create change for good, and for all.  On Wisconsin! 17 More Communities Join Call for an Amendment  Judy Nagel: Getting Big Money Out of Politics Will Speed Economic Recovery After the Pandemic  Meet Alexandra Bixler: Ready to Empower Americans to Make Change  While citizen leaders choose to devote their time, energy and financial support to the American Promise movement for a variety of reasons, nearly all of them decide to engage because they want to leave a better legacy for the future.  Many citizen leaders—such as Port Clinton, Ohio, chapter leader Ellen Greene Bush and recent college graduate Devin Hiett—believe an end to big money in politics is the reform needed to unlock the gridlock in Washington and ensure clean air and water for all Americans, a reason that’s particularly relevant this week as we mark 50 years of celebrating Earth Day.  Others want to help create a healthier America for their grandchildren. That’s what motivates Minnesota chapter leader Vicki Barnes, who recently helped lead a major victory in her state—an amendment resolution introduced to the Minnesota Senate by two Republican senators. If passed, this resolution will make Minnesota the 21st state to formally call on Congress to return an amendment for ratification.  In the April election next door in Wisconsin, 17 communities overwhelmingly voted yes on a referendum saying only humans should have inalienable rights and money isn’t speech, making a total of 163 Wisconsin communities that have called for the amendment.  While each of us is currently called to stay at home to protect the public health of our communities, we also have an opportunity to consider the many reasons we are each driven to contribute to a stronger, more resilient political system that represents all of us rather than the wealthy few. Fueled by our individual motivations, we can work together to fix our dysfunctional political system and restore the promise of our democracy.  Citizen Leaders Drive Amendment Resolution in the Minnesota Senate  Devin Hiett: The 28th Amendment Will Empower Young Americans  Climate Change and Big Money in Politics  Citizen Leadership Spotlight: Ellen Greene Bush  Amidst the national and global crisis, Americans are not only taking care of ourselves and our families, but are taking care of our communities and each other, too.  At American Promise, we’re inspired by that, and by so many American Promise members who have reached out to reaffirm that our mission—to unite and empower Americans to build a strong Republic and healthy democracy—is more urgent than ever.  In the past few weeks, we’ve moved our national calls, local chapter meetings, town halls, and educational opportunities online with Zoom. We’ve rolled out our digital toolkit to better reach our fellow citizens, legislators, and candidates. And your efforts in the states are moving ahead—including one that can make Alaska the 21st state to call for the American Promise constitutional amendment! More on that and a great piece from Joe Geldhof, our friend and American Promise leader in Juneau, are in this issue.  In addition to health and economic challenges, we have a serious challenge of campaigning and voting during widespread stay-at-home precautions. We do face a national crisis today, and we have done so before. But Americans never stopped advocating, listening, arguing, campaigning and voting, despite the Civil War, two World Wars, and devastating pandemics past. Today, we will do so again.  In this issue, you’ll find information about making sure voting and elections are safe and secure. Every state may be different in our federalist system, so be sure to check to see what your state and community are doing.  Finally, we don’t just vote for the sake of voting. We vote for better representation and real reform. Now is the time to make sure every candidate running in your community has signed the American Promise Candidate Pledge, and supports the American Promise amendment.  Arundhati Roy says, “historically, pandemics have forced humans to break with the past and imagine their world anew. This one is no different. It is a portal, a gateway between one world and the next.”  We’re grateful to you and all of our American Promise community for this opportunity to imagine and build our world anew, even as we navigate this challenging storm.  Voting in Times of National Crisis  A Passion for Independence: An Alaskan Shares Why the 49th State May Be the 21st to Call for the 28th Amendment  As the COVID-19 pandemic brings new challenges and stresses across the country and around the globe, it also is revealing strengths and weaknesses in our systems and raising questions about what our nation and world will look like in the future. Many of these systems and issues that affect our everyday lives are at the heart of why citizen leaders like you have joined American Promise in the movement to get big money out of politics.  This week we highlight three American Promise citizen leaders who have worked in health care and were among those who provided written testimony for last month’s congressional hearing on the 28th Amendment. In their testimony and in the article featured below, Ellen Greene Bush, Marie HenselderKimmel and Robbi Duda explain how they have witnessed big money from special interest groups affect their patients, the care they receive, and the overall U.S. health-care system.  While the pandemic renews questions about the cost of care and access to the U.S. health system, we are grateful for the health-care workers and other essential workers on the front lines of this battle, providing services to keep our communities functional.  We’re also grateful for the work that continues—virtually for now—across our nation as American Promise citizen leaders continue their advocacy for a constitutional amendment to limit the influence of big money in the U.S. political system. Each of us can work separately toward our common goal of restoring the voice of we the people and a stronger, healthier democracy.  Health-Care Professionals Call for a Constitutional Amendment to Limit Political Spending  Take a Deeper Look Inside Money in Politics and Health Care  In this uncharted time for people around the world, businesses are facing new challenges to their resiliency and questioning how best to prepare for the future. The current crisis shows all too clearly the interdependence of the health of our communities, our economy and our country. That is why, amid these troubling times, exceptional business leaders also recognize the need to address the systemic challenges facing our democracy: More than 100 business leaders nationwide are stepping up and adding their voices to the citizen-led call for a constitutional amendment to authorize limits on political spending.  By signing and supporting the American Promise Statement of Principle for Business Professionals, these business professionals—who represent a range of political interests and organizations of every size and scope—have come together to innovate for a stronger economy and say unequivocally that the pay-to-play political system does not benefit business.  We know business leaders face many serious challenges right now, but we also know business leaders are among our nation’s most future-thinking, innovative citizens who know what it means to exercise real leadership. Today it is all too clear that we need a well-functioning government that is responsible to the people it serves. With the announcement of our initial list of signers, we hope that businesspeople concerned about the long-term direction of our country and our economy will learn more and support this amendment as a constructive, truly American solution.  Join us as we the people work for an amendment that gets to the root of a dysfunctional system and creates an opportunity for a stronger economic future for everyone.  Business Leaders Tackle Pay-to-Play Politics  Across the nation, citizen leaders are celebrating local successes as they advance the American Promise Amendment to get big money out of politics. In Maine, a U.S. Senate race that is drawing record campaign contributions—many from out-of-state interest groups and other big-dollar donors—also is renewing calls for a constitutional amendment to reduce the influence of big money in elections.  Stand with Maine is a citizen-led campaign seeking to urge Maine representatives to end the domination of big money and return representation in Maine to voters, not out-of-state special interests. In a recent petition-gathering effort on Super Tuesday, when Mainers headed to the polls, volunteers collected nearly 1,000 signatures. Maine citizens can also sign the petition online here.  Maine is just one example of citizens standing together against a big-money system robbing them of their voices. They join fellow citizen leaders in Alaska, Minnesota, Texas, Virginia and many more states who are working together every day to make the changes we need across our states and our nation.  Women have played a crucial role in the pursuit of equality for all American citizens—as leaders of the Underground Railroad, in the decades-long effort for the 19th Amendment that granted women the right to vote, as drivers of the Civil Rights movement, and much much more. This March, as our country celebrates Women’s History Month, American Promise highlights the leadership of women citizen leaders in the movement for our nation’s next constitutional amendment: to reduce the influence of big money in politics and strengthen the right of equality for all American citizens.  Across the country, women are working with American Promise to advance the 28th Amendment through their leadership and advocacy. Here are just a few of many examples:  In Texas, citizen leader Ann Drumm is advocating for the amendment as a path toward a more functional government and action on climate policy.  In New Hampshire, American Promise Advisory Council member Ella McGrail and other citizen leaders successfully urged legislators to make that state the 20th to call on Congress to pass an amendment regarding big money in politics.  In New Mexico, Ishwari Sollohub and other democracy reform advocates are encouraging more of their elected officials to sign the American Promise Candidate Pledge.  Ann, Ella and Ishwari are just three of the thousands of American Promise citizen leaders across the country leading by example and working toward a solution for our country’s dysfunctional political system—following in the footsteps of the reformers before them and forging a path toward equality for all American citizens.  As the presidential election trail pace intensifies, so do American citizens’ concerns about the state of our democracy. While recent polls show a majority of Americans think foreign governments will try to influence the 2020 election, and billionaires continue to pour money into campaigns—their own and others’—the average voter is left to wonder what influence they truly have.  Our influence lies in the majority of voters who know the American political system can, and must, be better—and must give equal voice to every American. And that when it does, we can solve so many of the policy issues we face.  In our work with American Promise citizen leaders across the country, we’ve witnessed how this common belief creates momentum and energy, and how the call for a constitutional amendment to reduce the influence of money in politics is growing louder with strength from additional voices across the political spectrum—like Hal Gurian and John DeSpelder of Michigan.  This year we’re hearing the call for change loudly in Minnesota, Maine, Alaska and other locations across the country where citizen leaders are talking with their elected officials, urging them to join the movement for the 28th Amendment, and realizing the power we all have when we come together.  Political Spending from Foreign Entities Threatens American Democracy  A Conversation on Money in Politics: Reaching Across the Divide to Save Our Democracy  Watch: FEC Commissioner Ellen Weintraub on Dark Money  As the 2020 election generates news bites and headlines, and political ads fill the airwaves, many Americans already are tuning out, with months to go before the campaign finish line. They do so for various reasons—they may feel their vote doesn’t count, their choices are limited, their views go unacknowledged—as they see little opportunity to have a say in our current dysfunctional political system dominated by wealthy campaign contributors.  They aren’t alone in their concerns about the outsize influence that big-money donors wield over our elected leaders—some of whom feel the same. As an example, this week’s newsletter features former Senate candidate and author Neal Simon, who turned his lessons from and frustrations with the campaign system into inspiration for 10 democracy reform proposals he outlines in his new book.  Similarly, citizen leaders across the country are seizing opportunities to find the good in their frustration by speaking up for and making strides toward real change to end the dysfunction and revive our political system. As they advance an amendment that would allow for reasonable limits on campaign spending, they also restore the promise of democracy and the power of our vote.  Author Calls for Unity and Reform—Including the 28th Amendment—in New Book  Spending updates from the current presidential race provide more evidence of the power and access big money wields in campaigns: Billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent more than $300 million on advertising since joining the race in November; and fellow billionaire and Democratic hopeful Tom Steyer has spent $145 million on ads. On the Republican side, casino magnate Sheldon Adelson plans to donate $100 million to President Trump’s re-election campaign. This use of personal wealth to generate media headlines and gain access to voters’ living rooms through the airwaves—rather than engaging in a two-way dialogue—is not what the Founding Fathers intended.  As political spending climbs higher and higher with each election cycle, and the majority of campaign donations come from a few wealthy Americans, citizen leaders are saying enough—and advocating for an amendment that allows states and Congress to enact reasonable limits on election spending and ensure a political voice for all American citizens.  American Promise joined citizen leaders in taking this call for systemic change to Capitol Hill for a House committee hearing last week, where Americans showed up and spoke up—sharing why a majority of us agree now is the time to limit the influence of big money in politics and restore the democratic promise of America.  Jeff Clements: Citizen Pressure is Advancing an Amendment to Get Big Money Out of Politics  Watch Azor Cole at the Congressional Hearing Press Conference  Amid this week’s chaos of the Iowa caucuses and the political rancor from both sides of the aisle from the State of the Union, we are hugely encouraged by one political event: The movement for the 28th Amendment took a big step forward with a Feb. 6 hearing before the U.S. House Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties Committee.  This significant development happened thanks to the tireless efforts of you, our citizen leaders, who are fueling the grassroots advances—from local events to Capitol Hill hearings—needed to make the 28th Amendment a nationwide reality. And we were fortunate to submit statements from many of our citizen leaders, including legal experts, business leaders, veterans, elected officials, healthcare professionals, young people, parents, grandparents, Republicans, Democrats, and independents.  You can continue to advocate for the 28th Amendment by asking your elected officials to support these efforts using this simple tool, or to sign the American Promise Candidate Pledge and use their position to advance resolutions that will reduce the influence of big money in our political system and restore the voice and power of we the people.  4 Questions with 28th Amendment Advocate Congressman Jim McGovern  Join Our Monthly National Call and Hear from Congressman Ted Deutch!  Some anniversaries are celebrations, while others serve as a springboard for action or change.  Last week marked the 56th ratification anniversary of the 24th Amendment, which ended the election poll taxes that prevented many black citizens and other disenfranchised Americans from voting. As we move into February and observe Black History Month, we honor the many past Americans—especially the African American community—whose mark on history has been to expand the rights of democracy to their fellow Americans, often overcoming legal decisions that have denied those rights.  Today we have another opportunity to expand the rights of democracy, this time by advancing an amendment to ensure that the voices of all American citizens are heard rather than only those of the wealthy few. The history of our nation has been shaped by Americans standing together and demanding rights for ourselves and our fellow citizens. Start now by asking your elected officials to sign the American Promise Candidate Pledge and declare on the record that they will use their office to advance the 28th Amendment.  Through our cross-country, cross-partisan movement, we can build on the widespread desire for equal representation in our political system.  The History of People Power: Amendments Through the Years  The Conservative Role in Passing an Anti-Corruption Amendment  Malcolm Salter, Harvard Business School on Crony Capitalism  As big-dollar donors buy outsize influence and shape our nation’s political agenda, they reduce responsiveness to voters and push the system toward dysfunction.  The numbers tell the story. In the 10 years since the Citizens United ruling, campaign finance amounts have ballooned and continue to grow: nearly $6 billion was spent on the 2018 congressional election, and more than $10 billion is projected to be spent in the 2020 election cycle.  But other big numbers provide a hopeful counterpoint: The 77% of Americans—about 250 million people, from across the political spectrum—who agree on the need for limits on political donations from individuals and organizations, many of whom were speaking out about the issue this week at events and in publications across the nation.  That’s a lot of political will—enough to build and propel a movement and create lasting change. It’s why American Promise was created and why the movement continues to grow, thanks to the passion and drive of thousands of citizen leaders like you.   Citizens United Anniversary Page  As we approach the holiday that honors the life and work of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., I am reminded that the right to freedom and liberty, the right to vote, and the right to political participation were not granted to most Americans by our founding documents. Instead they were all won by Americans who, over years, decades and centuries, and in the face of violence, imprisonment and death, demanded that our country live up to its most important ideals.  Next week marks the 10th anniversary of the Supreme Court Citizens United decision that unleashed a torrent of big money into our political system, distorting the balance of democracy in favor of the wealthiest. To address this imbalance, today again the American people are coming together and demanding an equal voice for every citizen.  In honor of Dr. King’s memory we celebrate the thousands of Americans who have fought to build a better America for future generations. Thank you for joining them in the ongoing quest to fulfill the greatest promise of our nation.  Honoring the Legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. as a New Generation of Reformers Takes Action  We the People: Real Citizens United to Save Our Republic  As we get back to work at the start of 2020, we see opportunities for change—and at American Promise, we’re gearing up to seize them. It’s an election year, when the media spotlight will shine brightly on candidates looking to earn our vote.  That means it’s an opportunity for citizen leaders to shine a spotlight on the issues of most importance to them and their communities. In recent years, the overarching issue of big money in politics has undercut progress on so many others—and a majority of Americans agree that it’s time to do something about it.  Join us as we shine a light on the problem of big money in politics—and the amendment that will create a path to permanent change.  With a Renewed Potential for Success, the Equal Rights Amendment Ready to Set Off a Period of Structural Reform  A History of People Power: Six Times (So Far!) Americans Have Overruled SCOTUS to Secure Our Rights  At the start of a new decade and a presidential election year, we at American Promise are gearing up for an eventful 2020, and we’re eager to build on the progress of our movement for the 28th Amendment.  As more Americans become weary and dissatisfied as they increasingly feel the effects of a corrupt political system in the wake of the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling 10 years ago, we are focused on the opportunity to gain more citizen leaders advocating for positive change rather than negative finger-pointing.  Our citizen leaders are crucial to the success of each of our goals for 2020, from building our grassroots movement to get big money out of politics, to encouraging more elected officials to sign on to the American Promise Candidate Pledge, to deepening support for the 28th Amendment in Congress.  In the new year, fixing our broken political system is the most important task ahead of us. We’re grateful you are joining the work to get big money out of politics and encouraging other citizen leaders and elected officials to do the same.  A Look Ahead: Our 2020 Goals for Advancing the 28th Amendment  Faced with dysfunctional, divisive politics on the federal level, many Americans are growing increasingly dismayed with the state of our nation. Amid a perceived deep divide, a majority of us agree that our political system isn’t working for most citizens—Americans across the political spectrum recently named political corruption the No. 1 issue our nation faces (read our op-ed about International Anti-Corruption Day, which was Dec. 9).  Given this, many Americans feel moved to act. American Promise citizen leaders across the country are taking action where they can make the biggest difference: on the local and state levels. As our friends from RepresentUs note in this video, taking action on the state level has been the key to creating massive federal change. And the percentage of us needed to be actively involved to create this real and lasting change is 3.5%—about 11 million Americans. Relatively speaking, a small number of us can make a big difference.  We thank the many of you who have heeded the call to action and are working locally to get big money out of politics through the 28th Amendment. Through your work, and the work of a growing group of fellow citizen leaders across America, we can act locally while building a movement for national change and creating a functional political system that serves us all.  International Anti-Corruption Day Highlights Our Democratic Responsibilities at Home  Public Campaign Finance: Fighting Big Money with Small Donors  Together, our impact is greater. We see that in the power of our growing cross-partisan, cross-country movement for the 28th Amendment. And this week we saw it in the impressive wave of support during our successful Giving Tuesday campaign.  Thanks to you, our citizen leaders and generous supporters, American Promise will ride a strong wave of momentum into the new year—and continue our collaborative work to propel the issue of big money in politics into the national spotlight. As we highlight in this week’s newsletter, the corruptive effects of big money are making waves in the business world and in the most recent presidential debate—reflecting the fact that a majority of Americans realize their political voices are being drowned out by wealthy election donors buying influence and shaping policy.  As more Americans come together to join the movement for the 28th Amendment, our call for change grows louder and more powerful. Together, we will claim our democratic right to elect leaders who represent our interests—rather than special interests—and move toward a political system that works for all citizens.  When Big Corporations Run Washington, Small Businesses are the Suckers  Presidential Candidates Must Address Political Corruption  Considering the current turf-battles-at-every-corner state of our union, this Thanksgiving holiday presents an opportunity: to consider how the fundamental promise of our nation—a representative government where we each have a voice in the policies that affect our everyday lives—unites us as Americans.  Our feature article this week highlights a recent survey that found more than half of American voters believe corruption in the political system is the most serious problem facing the country, outranking any other issue. These are Americans with beliefs that span the political spectrum, but who all see how the current system isn’t representing them and how as democratic citizens we are called to change that reality.  The pervasive issue of big money in politics provides a chance for we the people to dispel the narrative that we are divided on every issue and instead work together as fellow citizens in the movement for the 28th Amendment. As American Promise prepares for a new year and expanded efforts in 2020, we ask you to invite your neighbors, family, friends, and other concerned citizens—especially those with views different than your own—to join the cause of our time and help us win a constitutional amendment to put the power back in the hands of the people.  Coming Together for One Goal: Bridging the Cross-Partisan Divide  A Conversation on Money in Politics: Reaching Across the Divide to Save Our Democracy  In today’s world we are ever-more dependent on technology—from our omnipresent phones to how we connect with loved ones, catch a lift, or pay for coffee. While these digital tools offer us many conveniences, they can also make it harder to connect in real life—and give us an alarming sense of disconnect when we are cut off from our digital aids.  That digital dependency also stretches to our political system, where the tech companies that control our data and devices are ramping up political spending, as noted in this week’s feature article, as they look to curry favor with elected policymakers to influence everything from privacy laws to antitrust legislation.  Tech corporations drive benefits for our nation—such as innovation, jobs, and economic strength—but giving them unlimited power to use their amassed wealth to influence elections and legislation undermines the system of checks and balances that is at the heart of our democracy. Citizen-led efforts at the local and state level are crucial to the continued success of our movement in 2020 and beyond, and real-world conversations and connections among citizen leaders provide the grassroots energy we need to pass the 28th Amendment.  By creating a democracy rooted in the power of people and connecting with fellow citizen leaders to advance the cross-partisan solution in the 28th Amendment, together we the people can combine our political voices and speak up in our communities and state capitals for a government that reflects our wishes and well-being, rather than the power of big-dollar donors.  Big Money and Big Tech: How tech giants use amassed wealth to exert power over our government  A Patent Example of Big Money Influencing Politics: Why I Joined American Promise  Managing Director Leah Field in The Hill: Ranked-Choice Voting Win in NYC Shows Strength of Citizen-Led Democracy Reform  While our nation was founded on the ideal of equal representation, tactics to rig the system and undermine the power of the public stretch back for centuries. As this week’s first feature notes, gerrymandering originated in 1812, when Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry approved a redistricting plan designed to keep Republicans in power and suppress the Federalists’ chances of winning office.  While incumbents have been rigging the system to protect their turf for more than 200 years, throughout our history another powerful force has helped shape our nation: the American people, who time and again have come together against concentrations of power, and worked to pass amendments that expand our notions of democracy.  Today, once more, Americans are saying “Enough is enough” about the concentrations of wealth and power that act to weaken our voice in our democracy. Those working to re-assert the strength of our votes represent all political stripes and every generation—including college students like Isabelle Pekarsky and Devin Hiett, who joined dozens of other young Americans to sign the Cause of Our Time Statement of Principle, committing to advance the 28th Amendment and recruit other young people to join them.  The systemic issues at play today may have centuries-old roots, but our movement to get big money out of politics continues a long history of Americans strengthening our democracy. And as with every successful citizen-led amendment of the past, our movement will succeed thanks to Americans coming together with strength and determination to uphold the greatest promise of our nation: Equal representation for all.  A Dark Partnership: How Unlimited Money in Politics and Gerrymandering Work Together to Erode the Value of Our Votes  College Students Commit to Tackle Big Money in Our Nation’s Capital  Big money’s grasp on our country extends wide and deep, impacting issues that affect the everyday lives of Americans—from the economy to health care to education and beyond. While troubling, these wide-ranging effects are part of the strength of our movement for the 28th Amendment. Americans across the nation and political spectrum approach the issue from a variety of perspectives, but they all come to the same conclusion: big money in politics is hurting us, as individuals and as a nation.  This is why a cross-partisan majority of Americans want limits on campaign spending to reduce the undue influence of corporations, special interest groups, unions and wealthy individuals. United by these shared concerns, citizen leaders from all backgrounds are joining forces to reclaim their political voice and demand representation for all Americans rather than the wealthy few.  We saw this in person during the recent National Citizen Leadership Conference, which brought together hundreds of citizen leaders. On Citizen Lobby Day we headed to Capitol Hill for more than 120 meetings with members of Congress, advocating not only for the Amendment, but for our representatives to reach across the aisle and collaborate on this issue—not from the perspective of their political party but from our shared perspective as American citizens.  By speaking out against big money in politics, we speak up for systems—economy, health care, education—that work for us all. By standing together, no matter which issues are closest to us, we can advance the 28th Amendment and restore the promise of our democracy.  Big Money and Health-Care Reform: How the Big Money System Helps Keep the U.S. Health-Care System Among the Most Expensive in the World  How Business for American Promise Will Create a Level Economic Playing Field and Encourage Innovation  For young Americans, today’s problems are tomorrow’s crises. From overwhelming student loan debt to the climate catastrophe to skyrocketing health care costs, these problems are exacerbated by our dysfunctional, stalled political system.  But the largest rising generation in history has an opportunity to use its political will to create real change—and that’s why American Promise is asking young people across the country to come together against big money in politics and join the movement for the 28th Amendment. By signing the Cause of Our Time Statement of Principle, young people can raise their collective political voice, act for the future, and work to restore a government for We the People rather than the big-money special interests that now dominate.  We’ve seen the power citizen leaders have when they demand action on this issue. In New Hampshire, Corinne Dodge, former State Senator Jim Rubens and many others organized a grassroots effort against political corruption that resulted in New Hampshire becoming the 20th state to call on Congress for a constitutional amendment. And thanks to citizen efforts, 13 current and past 2020 presidential candidates have signed the American Promise Candidate Pledge to advance the amendment if elected—the most recent to join the bipartisan movement is Republican former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld.  Now we want you and other American Promise citizen leaders to seize your power and invite more young Americans to join the movement to get big money out of politics. Share the Cause of Our Time Statement of Principle with your friends and family and ask them to help us advance the 28th Amendment to address big money—the root cause of so many current political problems.  Join us in fighting for the Cause of Our Time!  2020 Presidential Candidates on Both Sides of the Aisle Want to End Big Money in Politics  With just days to go until the National Citizen Leadership Conference, our team is gearing up for an inspirational, action-packed event that will propel our movement throughout the coming year. The NCLC will draw hundreds of citizens, elected officials, democracy reform leaders, authors, students and more from across the country, with a wide array of backgrounds and beliefs but one shared purpose: To preserve our democracy by ending the domination of big money in politics and returning our country’s government to the people.  The NCLC will include plenty of networking, connections and fun, but we are serious about the critical importance of our mission. After we gather in our nation’s capital, we will take the momentum, strategies, skills and passion back to our communities across the country and gear up for huge victories for the 28th Amendment in the coming year.  A cross-partisan majority of Americans agree: It’s time to limit the influence of big donors, corporations, unions and other wealthy special interests and restore our democracy so We the People can govern. At the NCLC, we will come together and share the empowerment and inspiration to continue our work to assert, once again, that the United States of America is committed to our founding promise: equal representation for all.  The far-reaching influence of big money in politics affects Americans who span the political spectrum, come from communities of all sizes, and include citizens young and old. Our movement for the 28th Amendment is built on the strength of this cross-partisan, intergenerational group of citizen leaders moved to act in hopes of creating a brighter future for all.  Recently, people from younger generations have been stepping up and speaking out on policy issues, like Greta Thunberg’s Global Climate Strike that drew millions around the world and Renaldo Pearson’s 600-mile walk for democracy reform with RepresentUs that ended with a U.S. Capitol rally.  Later this month, American Promise citizen leaders will be on that same ground in our nation’s capital, coming together for Citizen Lobby Day at the end of the National Citizen Leadership Conference to meet with their elected representatives and work with them to get big money out of politics.  Through the energy and vision of a rising generation of reform leaders joining other citizens to work for a stronger future, the cross-partisan movement for the 28th Amendment gains strength and momentum. Together, we will create lasting change.  Renaldo Pearson’s 600-Mile Journey Toward Democracy Reform  Hear Rep. Jamie Raskin Share How Citizens Can Make Change in Congress, at #NCLC2019!  Courtney Hight: Why Sierra Club Supports Democracy Reform Alongside Environmental Justice  From the East Coast to the West Coast, from the northern Rockies to the Gulf of Mexico, the work to get big money out of politics is rooted at the local level. At the heart of the cross-country American Promise network are our citizen leaders, who are connecting with others—in American Promise Associations and elsewhere—through a shared concern about the state of our democracy and the future of our country.  By broadening support for the 28th Amendment at the local and state levels among fellow citizens and elected officials, this citizen-led network is building the momentum needed for the amendment to advance to Congress. In just a few weeks, these citizen leaders will come together to collaborate, gain inspiration, and learn from each other at the National Citizen Leadership Conference.  Register now for NCLC to build on this year’s momentum and learn from American Promise leaders:  Like Ella McGrail of New Hampshire, which earlier this year became the 20th state to approve a resolution calling for Congress to limit big money in politics.  Like Dr. Lynn Horton Morrison and Rod Morrison, who are working with fellow citizen leaders at Wyoming Promise to advance a state resolution calling for the 28th Amendment and reduce the influence of dark money in local campaigns.  Like Elizabeth Doty, who as co-founder of Business for American Promise is building on the momentum of the Bay Area American Promise Business Council to create a network of business leaders across the country working for free-market capitalism.  You can join them by joining an American Promise Association—check here for the closest chapter or inquire about launching a chapter. Through the collective work of citizen leaders like you, we’ll advance the movement toward a government that reflects the wishes of the majority rather than the wealthy few and restore our democracy to ensure a stronger future for our nation.  How Our State-by-State Strategy Will Work to Pass the 28th Amendment  Citizen Leader Eric Tien Walks 131 Miles in Anti-Corruption Protest  A number of issues draw citizen leaders to American Promise—crumbling infrastructure, voting rights, skyrocketing health care costs, and the climate crisis among them. By deciding to act on their concerns and push for democracy reform, these citizen leaders have realized the one root cause behind our policy ills: big money in politics.  While it’s easy to get discouraged in these divisive political times, it’s also important to celebrate moments of unity and hope. Last Friday an estimated 4 million people joined the Global Climate Strike and its youth-led call to demand policy action on climate change that endangers our planet and its people.  Next month, democracy reform advocates will gather with American Promise in the Washington, D.C., metro area for the National Citizen Leadership Conference, where they’ll hear from a lineup of inspirational speakers, network with others working to get big money out of politics, and head to Capitol Hill to meet with their representatives in Congress and urge them to support the 28th Amendment.  These and other similar democracy-driven events show that we the people are coming together to act, to demand change, and to reclaim the government so it reflects our wishes rather than those of big money.  As our fellow democracy reform advocate Renaldo Pearson of Democracy911 and RepresentUs said—after walking 700 miles to protest political corruption—at Friday’s climate strike event outside the Capitol in Washington, D.C.: “No matter what your issue, no matter what your sickness, we can’t fix these existential threats until we fix this democracy.”  It’s time to come together and advance the 28th Amendment to get big money out of politics. Join us!  Big Money Stops Action on the Climate Crisis  Alan LaPolice: Big Money Fuels Hyperpartisanship  This week we celebrate Constitution Day, September 17, and embrace our work to continue improving the constitution so that more Americans are able to experience the freedom and political equality the Framers envisioned at the conception of our nation.  The Constitution laid out the principles upon which our democracy stands. Americans of every generation have used amendments to strengthen our nation and expand democratic rights. We must once again uphold our civic duty and fight for a constitutional amendment—this time to ensure our democratic power is not undermined by big money groups, special interests, and ultra-wealthy donors.  In honor of Constitution Day, American Promise President Jeff Clements and Cheryl Crawford, executive director of MassVOTE, co-wrote an op-ed in the International Business Times about the historical importance of the Constitution and the need to continue improving it through the amendment process. Additionally, dozens of legal professionals who hold a variety of political views signed the American Promise Statement of Principle supporting the 28th Amendment and recognizing the need for structural, democratic reform.  At American Promise, we fight every day for the 28th Amendment because the Constitution contains the will of the people and the foundational principles upon which our democracy thrives. Our cross-partisan, citizen-led movement grows stronger by the day, and we thank you all for your continued support.  The 28th Amendment Will Restore the American Promise  Ella McGrail: The 28th Amendment Will Cure the Sicknesses of Our Nation  Despite support among Americans across the political spectrum, current legislation calling for an amendment to get big money out of politics suffers from the same lopsided, party-line support we see with nearly every proposal in Congress—in this case, almost entirely Democratic support.  Separating government and the free market is a bedrock conservative issue, and a majority of conservative voters support the 28th Amendment—facts that highlight how our current hyperpartisan political system prevents elected officials from publicly supporting measures they believe in, and how the pay-to-play political system is weighted toward a wealthy few, rather than the majority of Americans.  Big money’s threat extends across the political spectrum and endangers the roots of our democracy. That makes the cross-partisan, citizen-led work of American Promise especially vital to the movement for the 28th Amendment. We must seize the power in our citizen numbers and strengthen our calls for change to work with and elect policymakers who will act on the wishes of the majority and approve the 28th Amendment.  John Wass, American Promise Board Chair: Republicans Should Support the 28th Amendment  As the recent statement by the Business Roundtable indicates, American CEOs are feeling increasingly compelled to respond to the brewing crisis of trust in U.S. institutions—including both our representative democracy and our economy.  In a strong U.S. economy, companies compete based on the value they create and share with customers, employees, investors and other stakeholders. Yet, in America today, the ideal of free enterprise is too often replaced by “pay-to-play,” where firms and special interests compete for favors based on political spending. Under the rules that result, profit often comes at the expense of human well-being—whether that be through inaccurate information about opioid addiction, delays in grounding the Boeing 737 Max, or unique advantages to firms that can afford to lobby for tax carve-outs.  This is why we are pleased to announce the official launch of Business for American Promise, a group of concerned businesspeople and citizens, with a wide variety of political interests and affiliations, who have come together out of a deep personal commitment to representative democracy and a shared concern for our country.  Business has an important role and responsibility to join with citizen leaders across the political spectrum working on reforms such as the 28th Amendment. The fact is, only business can clarify that rules that foster pay-to-play do not make economic sense, but threaten innovation, healthy markets, economic growth and fundamental public trust in our institutions.  We invite every member of the American Promise community to reach out as we broaden the conversation with our colleagues and friends in the business community. Join the Business for American Promise mailing list.  Freeing the Free Market: How Big Money in Politics Affects the Business Landscape  A New Partnership Between Corporations and Community  When they met in 1787 to create a document that would guide and shape the newly formed United States, those at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia knew it would serve as a structure for our democracy and its citizens. But they also realized the Constitution would need to reflect the will of the growing and changing nation far into the future, and so incorporated the amendment process into the document.  From the Bill of Rights to the 13th Amendment to abolish slavery to the 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote (which celebrates its 99th anniversary this month) to the 24th Amendment to eliminate the poll tax, the Constitution that serves as our nation’s legal structure has been modified to reflect the wants of we the people.  Now, we the people are seeing the harmful effects of inequality in politics due to the outsized influence of big-money donors, who drive policy decisions in their favor and dominate our elected officials’ time and attention. America has a history of independence—fiscal and otherwise—now under threat from corporations, unions, special interest groups and wealthy individuals using money to undermine democracy.  We learn from history, and sometimes we do repeat it—for the better. Following in the footsteps of others who fought for change through amendments, the American people again must come together to use our ultimate power and strengthen democracy by passing the 28th Amendment.  Taxation Without Representation: How Big Money in Politics Erodes Our Nation’s Fundamental Principles  Ellen Moorhouse of RepresentUs: Big Money Has Distorted Our Democracy  Big Money Affects Us All  Amid a political system influenced by the influx of big money, a majority of Americans are calling for their fundamental right to fair elections, equal representation and other democracy reforms.  At American Promise, we’re working to empower citizens and incorporate their calls for change as part of the Writing the 28th Amendment program. While big money is the overarching concern among those who realize how it infiltrates and deteriorates our democracy, other reform issues are gaining traction—from examining corporate rights and gerrymandering to enacting congressional term limits and public election financing.  Through our Writing the 28th Amendment town hall events and online poll, American Promise is gathering citizens’ thoughts on the change they want to see in an amendment to create real change and ensure equal representation for all, regardless of wealth.  7 Critical Democracy Reforms: Which Are Most Important to You?  BridgeUSA CEO Manu Meel: Everyday Americans Have the Power to Make Change  The movement for the 28th Amendment draws support from citizen leaders across the country and across the political spectrum. Our ongoing citizen engagement work is dedicated to building connections with reform advocates as diverse as the communities across our amazing nation—Americans of all political persuasions, ages, ethnicities and backgrounds.  This week we highlight a few recent ways citizen leaders of all kinds advocate for the 28th Amendment. Thanks to citizen advocates across the country, we’re building momentum and connections that continue to propel the 28th Amendment.  Jim Rubens Op-Ed: Republicans Should Support the 28th Amendment  Meet Nikki Naquin: American Promise’s Summer Intern  Then and Now: Big Money’s Power Keeps Growing  There’s a lot of buzz surrounding the 28th Amendment right now following its introduction in the U.S. Senate by Sen. Tom Udall and its emergence as an issue in the presidential campaign with 11 candidates committed to the American Promise Pledge.  Some may see this big money buzz as a partisan stunt or an exercise in futility. It’s neither—instead, it’s a reflection of the fact that a majority of Americans are frustrated by our current political system and ready for real change.  More than three-fourths of Americans support the 28th Amendment to limit the influence of money in federal and state elections. That cross-partisan unity indicates that most Americans see the everyday problems of big money in politics and are ready to elect leaders who promise to pursue real change.  2020 Presidential Candidates Endorse Constitutional Amendment  Inspired to Help Veterans, a Citizen Leader Joins the Movement for a 28th Amendment  The call to right our broken political system and reduce the influence of big money in government is riding a growing wave of momentum.  On Capitol Hill, the 28th Amendment made a splash this week when introduced in the Senate by lead sponsor Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico and 46 co-sponsors. On the 2020 presidential campaign trail, voters are letting candidates know they want a government that reflects their wishes rather than those who are able to buy political influence—and candidates are responding by making money in politics a key talking point. On Main Streets across the country, citizens of all political stripes are calling for an end to the domination of big money in our democracy.  Our cross-partisan movement to limit the power of money in state and federal elections depends on the work of you, our citizen leaders, who are stepping forward, coming together and calling for change—on Capitol Hill, on the campaign trail, and on the streets of your hometown.  Senator Tom Udall Introduces 28th Amendment  Building Momentum in Congress: Democracy Reform and Congressional Leaders to Speak at the 2019 National Citizen Leadership Conference  Another major milestone in the fight for the 28th Amendment is right around the corner. Senator Tom Udall (D-NM) will reintroduce the amendment in the U.S. Senate next Tuesday, July 30. The amendment, which was introduced in the House in January with bipartisan support, establishes that corporations are not people and money is not speech, allowing Congress and the states to put limits on campaign spending.  Rapidly building momentum all over the country is driving the 28th Amendment forward in Congress, and making it a major talking point in the 2020 Democratic primaries and the 2020 presidential election. This success is the result of effective, citizen-led grassroots action across the nation, which has pushed democracy reform into the mainstream debate. The only way to translate the broad cross-partisan support for the 28th Amendment among Americans into votes in Congress is through increasing citizen pressure on candidates and elected officials, and it’s working.  Senator Tom Udall Set to Introduce 28th Amendment  Announcing Speakers for the 2019 National Citizen Leadership Conference  When New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu recently rejected four political reform measures, he also rejected the voice of We the People. Thousands of New Hampshire citizens worked for years to advance those measures, including a resolution in support of the 28th Amendment, making the governor’s dismissal another example of how some political leaders protect the interests of special interests who buy undue influence in our elections and, in turn, influence the policies that shape our lives.  The New Hampshire resolution in support of the 28th Amendment stands, despite the governor’s symbolic veto. But his action speaks volumes. This battle is nothing less than a fight for the heart of our nation.  American Promise citizen leaders across the country are standing up for the rights of all citizens to have a say in our democracy, not just the wealthiest among us. Our movement is winning, but as the governor’s veto demonstrates, victory won’t be easy. We need every American on board to save our democracy.   Equal Citizens or Oligarchy?  American Promise Pledge Signers Bolster Congressional Action  Our strategy to win the amendment based on state-by-state victories is working. People across the nation and across the political spectrum are fired up about ending corruption and pay-to-play politics, and we’re seeing the momentum build in towns, cities, states and in Congress.  Last month New Hampshire became the 20th state to call for the amendment thanks to citizen leaders whose cross-partisan action is a model for organizing in states that have not yet called for the amendment. While passing an amendment to the Constitution may seem daunting, passing local resolutions is achievable—citizen leaders all over America are doing it, and they’re sharing their tips and lessons with anyone who wants to get involved.   State-by-State Steps to Victory  Free Digital Guide to Citizen Empowerment  Federal Court Blocks Ruling Aimed at Lowering Prescription Drug Prices  Last year two incumbent members of the Wright County Commission in Minnesota were up for re-election. But within the county is a landfill owned by an out-of-state company looking to expand its operations there. The landfill company supported two candidates running against the incumbents, spending a total of $45,000 on these two campaigns—far above the norm of around $2,000 per campaign and yet another example of an influx of corporate cash being spent to eclipse citizen voices.  But big money didn’t prevail this time—the local incumbents won, providing another example to all of us citizen leaders that fighting big money is hard work, but We the People still control the vote.   Strategies of Our Success  A Grassroots Leader Builds Enthusiasm in Ohio  In the heart of our country, agriculture plays a key role in the economy and the lives of millions of Americans and their communities. It is also subject to the influence of big money: In an increasingly concentrated agriculture industry, the family farmer faces an uphill battle against lower prices for crops and higher costs for production.  Every year, American tax dollars subsidize farms across the nation, in a system designed to provide stability and support to the farmers who feed our nation. Unfortunately, the unchecked influence of big money in politics means policies direct our tax dollars to large and corporate agricultural operations rather than smaller family farms—and impact everything from the quality of our food and the health of rural America to immigration policy and the GDP.  Big Money, the Farm Bill and Family Farms vs. Industrial Agriculture  American Promise Interviews Former Kansas Political Candidate  The goal of achieving political equality for all Americans is at the heart of the American Promise movement to get big money out of politics. While our democracy was founded on the premise of citizens who are free and equal to each other, reality has been a different story for many.  American Promise works everyday to expand the number and size of American Promise Associations across the nation while also striving to attract citizen leaders from diverse communities who better reflect our country’s citizens through their varied experiences and perspectives.  Celebrating Juneteenth and Our Ongoing Aspirations Toward Equality  Citizens Win in New Hampshire!  Meet Azor Cole: American Promise State Manager  On June 6, the New Hampshire Senate approved a bill calling for the 28th Amendment to get big money out of politics, making New Hampshire the 20th state to call for such an amendment. This historic victory put the movement for the 28th Amendment more than halfway to the 38 states required for ratification.

Mayor de Blasio said he is not ready to take his own advice about commuting via bike because his road skills need “work” — though a mayoral spokeswoman later claimed Hizzoner was only joking.  At an otherwise unrelated virus presser, Hizzoner said that he “needs to work” on his biking skills before pedaling to work in his own Vision Zero town, a comment that left reporters and activists slack-jawed given how many people are currently riding on unsafe streets where more than 220 people were killed last year, including 29 cyclists.  After initial publication of this story, a mayoral spokeswoman said the mayor was joking, and accused Streetsblog of “sensationalizing” the mayor’s comments — but reporters who were there also had the same reaction as Streetsblog. Spokeswoman Olivia Lapeyrolerie also said the mayor “needs to tune up” his own bike before taking it out for a spin. But the comment — whether serious or in jest — don’t change a thing: the mayor has only been on a bike twice in his nearly six-plus years in office. And people see the mayor’s reluctance to bike as hypocritical: if he can’t do it, why should the rest of us have to deal with the dangers?  “Mayor de Blasio is failing to lead by example and show New Yorkers that no one should be afraid to bike on their own streets,” said Bike New York’s Laura Shepard.  It goes beyond mere mayoral frailty. City streets should be safe enough that anyone — not just professional or experienced riders — could choose biking as a mode of transportation, especially in a crisis, but also every day in a waterfront city that needs to do more to combat climate change.  “What the mayor doesn’t get — and may never get— is that the goal is to build a city where no one has to ‘work on his biking skills’ in order to decide to bike to work, school or anywhere,” said safe-streets activist Doug Gordon.  What the mayor doesn't get—and may never get—is that the goal is to build a city where no one has to \"work on his biking skills\" in order to decide to bike to work, school or anywhere. https://t.co/wAQ5hSpoML — Doug Gordon (@BrooklynSpoke) March 10, 2020  De Blasio had on Sunday rightly urged New Yorkers to “bike or walk to work” if they can as a way of reducing the spread of the coronavirus — and there has been a significant surge in biking since then. But on Tuesday, even amid a surge in cycling in response to the health crisis, the self-declared bike mayor implied he’s too shaky on two wheels to practice what he’s preaching.  “I have some work to do on my bike [skills], but I think that’d be a great idea,” de Blasio said when asked if he’d follow his own advice.  The mayor’s comments were also criticized by some cyclists, who as young and healthy individuals, say they’re still more scared of dying by getting hit by a speeding truck than by contracting the coronavirus.  “Would love to bike to work, but I work in Queens and I am much more afraid of dying on Queens Blvd. than of COVID19,” Shane Ferro, a Queens public defender, said on Twitter. “Maybe there should be actual institutional response and support for these things rather than just foisting all these ‘tips’ on individuals and hoping they do them. Then again, an actual institutional response to these things might require the city to take away some parking spots.”  Would love to bike to work, but I work in Queens and I am much more afraid of dying on Queens Blvd. than of COVID19. Would love to build more time into my commute but it's a full hour and also the B train only comes once every 12 minutes even at rush hour… https://t.co/Na0gKhXE1s — Shane (@shaneferro) March 9, 2020  And others noted that their commutes don’t even welcome bikers to cross certain MTA-run bridges.  “My own most direct bike to work route, the Triboro Bridge (I go from Astoria to Harlem), doesn’t even technically allow bikes. So what would the mayor suggest?” journalist Jeanmarie Evelly said on Twitter.  This! My own most direct bike to work route, the Triboro Bridge (I go from Astoria to Harlem), doesn’t even techinically allow bikes. So what would the mayor suggest? https://t.co/giWmnVWATs — Jeanmarie Evelly (@JeanmarieEvelly) March 9, 2020  And while it’s good that the mayor is now suggesting more people ride to work, biking should not only be a secondhand option in times of crisis — it should consistently be encouraged and improved to help reduce the number of cars on the road, and help combat climate change, said Courtney Williams, CEO of the Brown Bike Girl.  “It’s great that the mayor has encouraged people to opt in to riding bikes as a means of avoiding being infected by the coronavirus,” said Williams, who like Streetsblog, has extending an invitation to the mayor to bike with her. “In the same breath, however, I can’t help but to be troubled by the underlying message loaded into the endorsement’s timing — that although bike commuting is an accessible and effective lifestyle decision, it is still a secondary alternative that you only adopt during times of crisis.”  Mr Mayor you are not only welcome to lead #bikenyc by example but to also join me this Saturday on my Anti-Alienation ride to make a statement against the spike in hate crimes against our city & nation's Asian residents over #COVID19 Deets for you: https://t.co/STSrI0tBj1 — Courtney Williams (@BrownBikeGirl) March 10, 2020  Indeed, many are seeing the coronavirus as a “crisistunity” — a chance to change people’s habits now to create a more sustainable future that lingers after the crisis has passed. And New Yorkers are already voting with their feet — or their pedals.  On Monday, March 9 — the day after de Blasio made his “bike to work” suggestion — 7,178 bikers crossed the Williamsburg Bridge — nearly 2,000 more than the previous Monday, when 5,192 crossed the bridge, according to the Department of Transportation.  We've seen a surge in cycling since the beginning of March, with warmer temperatures and after recommendations from @NYCMayor and @nycHealthy regarding COVID-19. This week we've seen a 50+% increase in cycling on all East River Bridges (vs 2019).https://t.co/LU74aCrDf2 pic.twitter.com/fOxqT8idjr — NYC DOT (@NYC_DOT) March 11, 2020  On a similar warm March day — March 1, 2017, when the temperature was 69 degrees — only 3,384 cyclists crossed the Williamsburg Bridge — 3,794 bikers fewer than Monday.  The DOT noticed similarly huge increases on the Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queensboro bridges, all up between 34 and 54 percent on Monday compared to the previous Monday.  So he’s actually scared to ride a bike in the city he’s in charge of. — Jen (@jtarentino) March 10, 2020  Those numbers would certainly increase with better infrastructure and a mayor who leads by example. Around the globe, cycling has grown in cities where mayors have joined their constituents in biking — such as Paris, whose Mayor Anne Hidalgo once famously said, “all Parisians will be biking!”  Hidalgo didn’t just make an empty promise; she rode in solidarity (and also restricted cars in many areas of town) and her constituents followed: Since 2018, the number of cyclists in Paris has more than doubled, according to one French outlet.  That’s why Transportation Alternatives (and members of Community Board 7) has called for the mayor to immediately implement changes, including:  create a zero tolerance policy on vehicles — city-owned, private, or commercial — blocking bike lanes, and cease any cycling-specific NYPD ticket stings. (The mayor said earlier this year that he would create a Vision Zero Unit within the NYPD, but no details of that unit, or its efforts, have been provided.)  build pop-up bike lanes, like those deployed during the UN General Assembly last September, “since the Green Wave plan can’t be implemented overnight,” Harris said.  quickly reconfigure key East River crossings, including dedicated, separated cycling paths on the Brooklyn and Queensboro bridges. The Queensboro Bridge is especially crowded because pedestrians and cyclists share a single path on the north side of the bridge. The numbers of walkers and cyclists were increasing on that span even before the current crisis, and the numbers are certainly not easing, as Streetsblog reported this week.  fast-track permitting and construction of sidewalk and on-street bike parking, and require that office buildings allow employees to enter with bikes  expedite the expansion of Citi Bike in underserved neighborhoods, roll out more stations and bike valets in Manhattan’s Central Business District, and subsidize a Citi Bike discount program to incentivize new riders.  On Tuesday, de Blasio said he hadn’t seen the suggestions, but would take a look at them.  “I haven’t seen them. I’ll happily look at them” he said. “We’ve obviously devoted a lot of police resources to clearing out bike lanes, we’ll keep doing that. We’re dealing with a crisis here with many, many elements, whatever we can do that we deem appropriate to help make it easier now we will.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 13, "positive": 64, "negative": 5, "joy": 11, "anger": 11, "surprise": 4, "fear": 10, "trust": 7}, "metadata": ["mayor", "virus", "activists", "climate", "doug", "coronavirus", "surge", "criticized", "contracting", "institutional", "commute", "journalist", "crisis", "ceo", "sustainable", "warmer", "infrastructure", "paris", "implement", "assembly", "harris"]}, {"text": "Return board members check ballots at the Allegheny County Elections Warehouse in Pittsburgh on Nov. 6.

This year saw the deaths of people who shifted culture through prose, pragmatism and persistence. It also witnessed tragedy, in talent struck down in its prime.  In 2019, the political world lost a giant in U.S. Rep. Elijah E. Cummings. He was born the son of a sharecropper, became a lawyer, then an influential congressman and champion of civil rights.  Cummings, who died in October, was chairman of one of the U.S. House committees that led an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump and was a formidable advocate for the poor in his Maryland district.  Another influential political figure, U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, died in July. Stevens was appointed to the high court as a Republican but became the leader of its liberal wing and a proponent of abortion rights and consumer protections.  Wealth, fame and a confident prescription for the nation's economic ills propelled H. Ross Perot ’s 1992 campaign against President George H.W. Bush and Democratic challenger Bill Clinton. He recorded the highest percentage for an independent or third-party candidate since 1912. He died in July.  The death of Toni Morrison in August left a chasm in the publishing world, where she was a “literary mother” to countless writers. She helped elevate multiculturalism to the world stage and unearthed the lives of the unknown and unwanted. She became the first black woman to receive the Nobel literature prize and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012.  Among those in the scientific world who died in 2019 was Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, the first person to walk in space. Leonov died in October. Others include scientist Wallace Smith Broecker, who died in February and popularized the term “global warming” as he raised early alarms about climate change.  In April, Hollywood lost director John Singleton, whose 1991 film \"Boyz N the Hood\" was praised as a realistic and compassionate take on race, class, peer pressure and family. He became the first black director to receive an Oscar nomination and the youngest at 24.  Doris Day, a top box-office draw and recording artist who died in May, stood for the 1950s ideal of innocence and G-rated love, a parallel world to her contemporary Marilyn Monroe.

Like other Democrats who addressed voters watching at home, the former vice president framed Trump as a threat to democracy and decency. Biden also spoke of his personal losses, making a connection to those grieving and suffering in the midst of a prolonged pandemic that has killed more than 170,000 Americans. “On this summer night, let me take a moment to speak to those of you who have lost the most,” said Biden, whose first wife and young daughter were killed in a car accident in 1972. “I have some idea how it feels to lose someone you love,” Biden continued. “I know that deep black hole that opens up in the middle of your chest and you feel you're being sucked into it. I know how mean and cruel and unfair life can be sometimes. But I've learned two things: First, your loved ones may have left this Earth but they’ll never leave your heart. They’ll always be with you, you’ll always hear them. And second, I found the best way through pain and loss and grief is to find purpose.”  Joe Biden speaks to people who lost someone to the coronavirus: \"Your loved one may have left this Earth, but they've never left your heart\"  Biden put forth a federalized approach to curbing the coronavirus’s spread: fast testing with fast results, more American-made medical and personal protective equipment, and a national mandate to wear masks. Trump has downplayed the severity of the pandemic, largely left the response to states and their governors, complained that more testing yields more positive cases (reflecting more poorly on him), and offered mixed messages on masks.  “In short,” Biden said, “we’ll do what we should have done from the very beginning. Our current president has failed in his most basic duty to this nation. He’s failed to protect us.” Much of the convention week was spent defining two men most voters already know: Trump, the business tycoon turned TV star turned president, and Biden, a politician for nearly 50 years. Few speakers — Sen. Bernie Sanders, the runner-up to Biden for the nomination, being a somewhat surprising exception — made an overtly positive case for Biden based on policy. Many used their time to condemn Trump or to celebrate Biden’s empathy and compassion. In one of the most emotional moments of Thursday’s program, Brayden Harrington, a 13-year-old from New Hampshire, shared how Biden, who stuttered as a child, helped him with his own stutter after meeting him on the campaign trail. There also were constant reminders of the Biden family tragedies, including a video tribute to the former vice president’s son Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015. Biden, though his remarks at points touched on all of those things, centered his candidacy around three areas: racial injustice, economic injustice, and environmental justice. All tie into the crises of the moment, and the latter two are areas where those to the left of Biden in the Democratic Party wish he would be more progressive. His plan for combating climate change, for example, is not packaged as the Green New Deal that’s favored by Sanders and others on the left. Rather, Biden presented his ideas more mildly and briskly, as “an opportunity for America to lead the world in clean energy and create millions of new good-paying jobs in the process.”  Olivier Douliery / Getty Images Jill and Joe Biden watch fireworks outside the Chase Center in Wilmington, Delaware, at the conclusion of the Democratic National Convention, Aug. 20.  He spent considerable time on the crisis of systemic racism. “History,” Biden said, “has thrust one more urgent task on us. Will we be the generation that finally wipes out the stain of racism from our national character?” He spoke of how Trump’s mollifying response to the white supremacist rallies in Charlottesville, Virginia, three years ago pushed him toward a third run for president. And he talked about George Floyd, the unarmed Black man killed by Minneapolis police in May in a case that has inspired anti-racism protests and opened a new national dialogue on race.  Joe Biden invokes Charlottesville and Trump's response: \"At that moment, I knew I'd have to run. As my father taught us, silence was complicity.\"  “One of the most important conversations I've had this entire campaign is with someone who was much too young to vote,” Biden said. “I met with 6-year-old Gianna Floyd, a day before her daddy George Floyd was laid to rest. She is an incredibly brave little girl. I’ll never forget. When I leaned down to speak with her, she looked into my eyes and said, ‘Daddy changed the world.’ ‘Daddy changed the world.’ Her words burrowed deep into my heart. Maybe George Floyd's murder was the breaking point.” Trump, whom the Republican Party will renominate for president next week, has so far struggled to find criticisms of Biden that resonate with many voters — a stark contrast to 2016, when anti–Hillary Clinton messages and chants formed the backbone of Trump’s presidential bid. Trump’s reelection team has leaned heavily on Biden’s age — at 77, he is three years older than Trump — and his tendency to misspeak. His campaign has repeatedly made baseless accusations that Biden is mentally unfit for the job. Ahead of Biden’s speech Thursday, Trump allies sent billboard trucks to Wilmington emblazoned with slogans like “If you can’t complete a sentence, you shouldn’t be president” and “I’m Joe Biden, and I forgot this message.” The tactic, and the months of talk about senility that accompanied it, had the effect of setting a strikingly low bar Thursday for the most consequential speech of Biden’s career. Trump had just one tweet during Biden’s speech Thursday night, moving the goalposts and accusing him of hollow words. “In 47 years,” he wrote, “Joe did none of the things of which he now speaks.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 16, "positive": 30, "negative": 22, "sadness": 1, "disgust": 2, "joy": 6, "anger": 14, "surprise": 7, "fear": 7, "trust": 7}, "metadata": ["joe", "donald", "democratic", "america", "biden", "convention", "existential", "themes", "campaign", "virus", "economy", "trump", "prolonged", "pandemic", "severity", "bernie", "emotional", "cancer", "economic", "environmental", "combating", "climate", "sanders", "fireworks", "crisis", "systemic", "supremacist", "george", "protests", "dialogue", "struggled", "stark", "presidential", "repeatedly", "accusations", "wilmington", "tweet"]}, {"text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Former Senate leader Harry Reid says if Democrats win the presidency and the Senate, Joe Biden should take “no more than three weeks” to test bipartisanship before ending the filibuster so Democrats can overcome what they call Republican obstruction and pass bills.  The retired Nevada Democrat told The Associated Press in an interview that he understands Biden wants to work with Republicans, as the former vice president and Delaware senator has in the past. But Reid said there is just too much that needs to be done in the country to wait around trying to reach agreements under the decades-old Senate practice of requiring 60 votes to advance legislation.  “Biden — who wants always to get along with people — I understand that,” Reid said by telephone from Nevada.  “We should give the Republicans a little bit of time, to see if they’re going to work with him,” he said. “But the time’s going to come when he’s going to have to move in and get rid of the filibuster.”  Asked how long Biden should wait it out before changing the rules, Reid said: “No more than three weeks.”  The 80-year-old Reid, who retired in 2017, has been among the most high-level political voices in favor of ending the 60-vote threshold for legislation. Critics of the filibuster argue it has outlived its purpose in the partisan era and only serves to grind business to a halt.  From afar, the onetime majority leader has made his views known before but rarely has he suggested a deadline for action. It is both a warning sign and road map for senators contemplating a 2021 agenda with a potentially new power dynamic in Washington after the election.  The 100-member Senate, where Republicans now hold a 53-47 edge, is expected to remain narrowly divided after the Nov. 3 election, regardless of which party wins control, making the 60-vote tally tough to reach.  Reid said if Biden thinks he can cut bipartisan deals with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the GOP leader, as they did in earlier years, “more power to him.”  But Reid warned that he knows McConnell better than any other Democratic and “Joe ought to be very careful.”  This is well-traveled terrain for the long-serving former senator, who helped sparked today’s procedural battles by partially ending the filibuster when Democrats had the majority. The rules change that Reid engineered allowed Democrats to confirm President Barack Obama’s administrative and most federal judicial nominees despite Republicans roadblocks.  When Republicans took control, McConnell pushed it to the next level with President Donald Trump, eliminating the filibuster for Supreme Court picks — a daring move that stunned Washington. McConnell’s critics say he is breaking the Senate, but Trump has been able to seat two Supreme Court justices on majority-only votes, and the Senate is poised to confirm a third, Amy Coney Barrett, on Monday.  The filibuster has been in place since the early 20th century, but is absent from the Constitution. Its supporters say it keeps the Senate from becoming just another version of the House, with majority rule. The higher vote threshold forces the parties to slow down and find bipartisan compromise.  But critics say the filibuster has become a recipe for legislative paralysis, empowering a minority of senators to thwart popular public opinion. They note it has been used to stall some of the nation’s most landmark laws, notably civil rights legislation.  Obama has since joined the effort for change. During the funeral this year for Rep. John Lewis, a civil rights leader, Obama announced his support for ending the filibuster, calling it a Jim Crow-era relic that was used to stall voting advances for Black people.  “That’s true,” said Reid, who was majority leader during Obama’s first term and helped pass the Affordable Care Act and other landmark legislation. “Once he did that, of course I let him know I appreciated it.”  Reid’s influence continues to be felt across Democratic political landscape, in ways large and small. He talks often to Biden and regularly keeps in touch with others, including Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York— and even some Republicans.  Reid suggests that Democrats are unwilling to sit by and allow Republicans to potentially block their agenda.  “We want to get something done,” he said, mentioning climate change and renewable energy investment as an example. “There’s so much more to do and we can’t do it if it takes 60 votes to get it done.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 8, "positive": 18, "negative": 15, "sadness": 1, "disgust": 3, "joy": 4, "anger": 5, "surprise": 2, "fear": 4, "trust": 9}, "metadata": ["washington", "senate", "leader", "joe", "biden", "understands", "delaware", "republicans", "agenda", "wins", "gop", "democratic", "sparked", "donald", "trump", "supporters", "landmark", "obama", "john", "calling", "term", "affordable", "talks", "climate"]}, {"text": "In a surprise move, 17 former Brazilian Finance ministers and Central Bank presidents came out strongly this week against the environmental policies of President Jair Bolsonaro’s government.  The letter signed by the 17 economic authorities presents four proposals for a green economy for the post-pandemic era: public and private investments in a low carbon economy; zero deforestation in the Amazon and the Cerrado; an increase in climate resilience; and a boost in new technology research and development.  The letter comes as pressure mounts on Bolsonaro to scrap his plan for Amazon economic development, which would allow mining and agribusiness on indigenous and conserved lands leading to massive deforestation. EU nations, international investors and companies have all condemned Bolsonaro’s environment record in recent days.  Brazil’s environmental situation and international reputation has deteriorated to such an extent after a year and a half of Jair Bolsonaro’s rule that a rebellion against his policies, and mobilization has emerged — surprisingly, not among conservationists, but from high up in the economic sector.  A group of 17 former Finance ministers and former Central Bank presidents released a letter this week arguing strongly for drastic shifts in the direction of the country’s environmental policy. Among the missive’s central points: end deforestation in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes, and resume an economic policy that takes climate change into account after the pandemic is over.  Among the signatories are Fernando Henrique Cardoso (former President of the Republic and Minister of Finance), Rubens Ricúpero, Armínio Fraga, Joaquim Levy, Pérsio Arida, Pedro Malan, Henrique Meirelles, and Luiz Carlos Bresser Pereira; they all worked within the governments of the last seven Brazilian presidents, except for the current administration.  Ricúpero, a Finance and Environment minister in the 1990s, expressed the group’s dissatisfaction during a press conference held on the Internet on Tuesday.”I find it very difficult, after everything that has happened, to maintain any illusion about the position of this government. Nothing that was dismantled at the beginning of this mandate has been reversed. The sub-secretariat for combating climate change of the Ministry of the Environment, for instance, was eliminated and has not yet been reinstated. [Environmental] funding cuts continue without any compensation, and in some areas were 40% of previous levels. [And] who has not heard the famous meeting of the ministries of [22 April] in which the anti-Minister of the Environment suggested ‘passing the cattle,’” a proposal by Ricardo Salles, Bolsonaro’s environment minister, that the government should utilize the Covid-19 pandemic as a distraction during which it could quietly move more environmental deregulation forward.  “At this point, it is necessary to have a credulity, an unlimited naivety to still believe,” in the Bolsonaro government, said Ricúpero.  Commenting on the administration’s poor record regarding deforestation, Ricúpero added that Bolsonaro’s newly established Amazon Council is “purely public relations. The rate of deforestation remains very high. The first six months [of 2020] have already surpassed the whole of last year, so even if the government achieves zero deforestation from now on, when destruction begins to accelerate with the dry months, this year is already lost.”  On Monday, Hamilton Mourão, vice president of the Republic and president of the Amazon Council, admitted to investors and representatives of transnational corporations that there will be no reduction in deforestation in 2020 — a disappointment to the international and Brazilian business community that fears an economic backlash against Brazil, possibly resulting in consumer boycotts or even international sanctions if Amazon deforestation isn’t curbed.  Ricúpero also said that the Army troops which Bolsonaro sent to the Amazon to deal with this year’s fire season are not qualified to combat deforestation. He noted that the military has spent more money in a month on duty there than what IBAMA, Brazil’s environmental agency, spends in a year. However, IBAMA has been largely defunded under the current administration.  “The most that can we expect, on the basis of increasing and continuous pressure [on the government], is what the Americans call ‘damage control.’ If only we can contain the destruction it will already be a great goal, which I confess, I am not sure is attainable,” Ricúpero concluded.  Also at the press conference, former Central Bank President Armínio Fraga described a parallel between Covid-19 and climate change: “The tragic pandemic has raised an alarm, but with regard to climate issues, the alarm is not being heard. Partly because that crisis is slow and silent, but people have to keep in mind that the impact, at the end of the line, could be much bigger than the pandemic we are living in.”  Fraga stressed that climate change must be a top priority of Brazil’s economic policy. “We have the tools, such as those to suppress environmental crime, but it goes much further, because in addition to the shift in conscience, there is also the need for economic incentives, to which people react. If incentives are designed to avoid the use of fossil fuels, to stimulate new research and technologies, we will have a leap in quality [results], not only in foreign investment, but also in domestic [investment], which is now paralyzed.… The subjects of climate change, carbon and the environment where we live, should be [our] most important map.”  After the press conference, Fraga told the Folha newspaper that just changing the Minister of the Environment will not solve the country’s problems. “He [Ricardo Salles] executes a mandate that is delegated by the president. If the president changes his mind on that topic, that is fine. But if it is [only] to put another [minister in his place] who will do the same thing, it will not solve anything. In short, the problem comes from above,” said the economist.  The letter signed by the 17 economic authorities, an initiative of the Climate and Society Institute (iCS) and the The World We Want Institute, presents four proposals for a green economy for the post-pandemic era: public and private investments in a low carbon economy; zero deforestation in the Amazon and the Cerrado; an increase in climate resilience; and a boost in new technology research and development.  “Depending on the climate scenario that we are going to encounter, the costs of neglecting climate events with systemic repercussions could be much higher than those of the current pandemic,” the letter states. “The potential calamitous impacts that climate change could have on financial stability have already made Central Banks internalize climate risks within their macroeconomic analyses… and caused financial markets to recognize and price, in a transparent way, such long-term risks.”  The Bolsonaro government has yet to offer a public response to the letter.

The immediate cause is a pair of 2018 city ordinances, Sections 94-442 and 94-443, that mandate a minimum concentration of shade trees while limiting palms in all open spaces.  The impetus behind the arboreal regulations is a larger concern, one that should be foremost at all levels of government, city, state and federal.  The concern is climate change, and Trump's continued blind denial of scientific fact for the sake of corporate profit is an abrogation of duty that dwarfs whatever he did regarding Ukraine to get impeached. He doesn't even fiddle while Australia burns and climate change becomes climate derangement.  The city of West Palm Beach not only recognizes the danger, but is also doing whatever a small municipality can to counter it.  “Rethinking paradise, today, tomorrow, together,” the city’s sustainability slogan goes.  That includes mandating the planting of shade trees, which have a cooling effect not imparted by palms. A shade tree can absorb more than 90 times the carbon a palm can.  “We are the ultimate tree huggers,” says Penni Redford, resilience and climate change manager at the Mayor's Office of Sustainability, City of West Palm Beach, a title for which there is no equivalent in the Trump administration.  Under Redford’s direction, the city is on track to give away 10,000 shade trees over the next decade. The city is also installing special sidewalks that have underlying structures allowing a tree to extend its roots into an underlying layer of what she calls “real soil… good dirt.”  “ We are the ultimate tree huggers. ” — Penni Redford, city of West Palm Beach  The regulations governing the city’s open areas say one shade tree must be planted every 1,000 square feet around single dwellings and duplexes. A minimum of 75 percent of the trees in parking lots have to bear leaves, not fronds and most be spaced so way to provide maximum shade for vehicles.  At the same time, the city has been seeking to make the streets more pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly.  “We’ve been treating to get people out of the cars, on bikes and walking,” Redford told The Daily Beast.  Back in 2016, the city inventoried its greenhouse gas emissions and established a multifaceted plan to reduce it to net zero by 2050. The city has in the meantime been saving millions of gallons of water with a conservation plan that includes—yes, Donald—reduced shower flow and high efficiency toilets.  “Does your property qualify for a free toilet?” a city online flyer asks.  The need for it all only became more apparent at the end of 2019, as the wettest September there in 125 years was followed by the warmest December on record.  “Things are a little topsy-turvy and we’ve got to pay attention to that,” Redford told The Daily Beast.  Meanwhile, overnight temperatures in the city have risen an average of five degrees in the past decade. Some of that is believed to be due to heat absorbed by sun-baked expanses during the day and may be offset by an increasing number of shade trees.  But such matters seem to be of no concern to our president, who has called climate change a “hoax” concocted by China. And he need not worry about seeing a dwindling number of fronds once he crosses the Intercoastal Waterway from West Palm Beach to Palm Beach and his new official home address, Mar-a-Lago.  The Town of Palm Beach did for a time consider requiring a certain number of shade trees, perhaps one every 5,000 square feet, with a maximum of eight, whatever the size of the open space. But even that modest requirement was nixed.  “Staff has reviewed the topic of shade trees and has researched how other upscale south Florida municipalities address shade trees in their development code,” the town reported in December of 2018. “For the communities that do require shade trees, the intent is to bolster a community’s tree canopy and to limit the number of palm trees per property. Staff believes that the Town has a very healthy canopy condition, well in excess of the requirements of the studied municipalities, and that the limiting of a property’s palm trees in not in the interest of the community.”  Even so, the town did commission a ” Technical Review of Proposed Coastal Management Program” in 2013 that found “certain considerations apply to Palm Beach as a whole,” including “sea-level rise and climate change planning and adaptations.”  “Since significant portions of the Island are presently vulnerable to storm damage and flooding, and rates of sea level rise are expected to increase in the future, the Town should initiate a planning process for adaptation to coastal climate change,” the study found.  The planning seems to involve pumping sand and maybe building a sea wall or two. But this richer-than-rich town is too busy luxuriating in paradise to rethink it. And its most talked about resident is a self-imagined Caesar who makes Nero look proactive and responsible.  Whatever Trump did with Ukraine, he continues to place the whole planet at risk.

Bernie Sanders for President. Nixon announced her endorsement with a new video, in which she speaks about Sen. Sanders’ consistent focus on the issues that impact working families, and his unparalleled ability to galvanize voters in order to defeat Donald Trump in November.  Nixon will hit the campaign trail for Bernie 2020 this weekend, traveling to Las Vegas, Nevada where she will host a debate watch party, speak at First Friday Las Vegas alongside national surrogate Phillip Agnew, kick off canvass launches, and meet with local LGBTQ community leaders. After a packed weekend meeting with hundreds of Nevadans, Nixon will head to the Granite State to rally the vote ahead of New Hampshire’s first in the nation primary.  “What you need in a politician is someone with a vision, someone who can galvanize people, and someone who can’t be bought. And there is no one who has those three qualities in greater abundance than Bernie Sanders,” said Cynthia Nixon. “I know that Bernie is not only the candidate with the best chance to defeat Donald Trump, but also the best chance to start addressing all the things that are wrong with our country. I want Bernie because I know he’s for me, but I want Bernie even more because I know he’s for all of us.”  “As a progressive activist, candidate and life-long New Yorker, Cynthia has stood on the right side of so many issues,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders. “From resisting the influence of corporate money in our politics to advocating for equitable education, she has fought for working families. I am proud to have her in our movement to transform this country.”  In her 2018 campaign for governor of New York, Nixon refused to accept corporate contributions. Nixon’s policy agenda centered on combatting rampant income inequality, full funding for schools not jails, a Green New Deal for New York, rent control, transportation access, health care for all, reproductive rights, criminal justice reform, immigrant and disability rights, empowering voters and ending homelessness.  Cynthia Nixon is a two-time Emmy, two-time Tony, SAG and Grammy Award-winning actress, who has been nominated for four Golden Globes. A lifelong New Yorker, Nixon has been a longtime activist for better funding for public schools, abortion rights and LGBTQ equality.  In 2018 Nixon ran for Governor of New York State. Her campaign successfully placed issues of racial, economic and gender inequality front and center. Nixon has been a proud union member since she began working as an actor at the age of 12 to earn money to pay for her college education. She continued to act in a variety of film, stage, and TV roles to put herself through Barnard College at Columbia University.  Perhaps best known for her role as Miranda Hobbes on HBO’s hit series “Sex and the City,” Nixon received her Grammy for her role in the audio version of “An Inconvenient Truth,” the seminal book warning about the dangers of climate change. Nixon made her directorial debut at The New Group with Joel Johnson’s “Rasheeda Speaking,” which received Lucille Lortel, Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle nominations. Nixon has appeared in over forty stage productions, a dozen on Broadway, and will be seen next in Ryan Murphy’s RATCHED on Netflix and in Julian Fellowes’ GILDED AGE on HBO. She and her wife Christine have three sons: Sam, Charlie and Max.  Nixon’s endorsement video can be seen here and is below:  The New Hampshire Labor News is a group of NH Workers who believe that we need to protect ourselves against the attacks on workers.

It was a balmy June day in 2017 when Donald Trump took to the lectern in the White House Rose Garden to announce the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, the only comprehensive global pact to tackle the spiraling crisis.  Todd Stern, who was the U.S.'s chief negotiator when the deal was sealed in Paris in 2015, forced himself to watch the speech. \"I found it sickening, it was mendacious from start to finish,\" said Stern. \"I was furious … because here we have this really important thing and here's this joker who doesn't understand anything he's talking about. It was a fraud.\" The terms of the accord mean no country can leave before November this year, so due to a quirk of timing, the U.S. will officially exit the Paris deal on 4 November – 100 days from now and just one day after the 2020 presidential election. The completion of Stern's misery, and possibly any realistic hopes of averting disastrous climate change, rests heavily upon the outcome of the election, which will pit Trump against former vice-president Joe Biden, who has vowed to rejoin the climate agreement.  The lifetime of the Paris agreement, signed in a wave of optimism in 2015, has seen the five hottest years ever recorded on Earth, unprecedented wildfires torching towns from California to Australia, record heatwaves baking Europe and India and temperatures briefly bursting beyond 100F (38C) in the Arctic. These sorts of impacts could be a mere appetizer, scientists warn, given they have been fueled by levels of global heating that are on track to triple, or worse, by the end of the century without drastic remedial action. The faltering global effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions and head off further calamity hinges, in significant part, on whether the U.S. decides to re-enter the fray. \"The choice of Biden or Trump in the White House is huge, not just for the U.S. but for the world generally to deal with climate change,\" said Stern. \"If Biden wins, November 4 is a blip, like a bad dream is over. If Trump wins, he seals the deal. The U.S. becomes a non-player and the goals of Paris become very, very difficult. Without the U.S. in the long term, they certainly aren't realistic.\"  Nearly 200 countries put their name to the Paris accords, pledging to face down the climate emergency and limit the average global temperature rise to \"well below\" 2C above the era before mass industrialization started pumping huge volumes of planet-warming gases into the atmosphere from cars, trucks, power plants and farms. A more aspirational goal of halting temperatures at a 1.5C rise was also included although, just five years on, the planet is already creeping perilously close to this mark. The Paris deal brought major, growing emitters like China and India on board with the quest to shift towards cleaner sources of energy, in part due to the urgings of Barack Obama, who claimed the agreement showed the U.S. was now a \"global leader in the fight against climate change.\" Trump, who once famously called climate science a \"hoax,\" has never looked kindly on the deal, which he framed as an international effort to damage the U.S. while letting China off too lightly. In his Rose Garden speech, Trump remarked that he was elected to \"represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.\" In reality, each country is free to choose its own emissions cuts without any sort of enforcement. \"Paris is like a vessel, such as a glass – you can pour water or wine into it,\" said Sue Biniaz, a former U.S. state department lawyer who drafted parts of the Paris deal. \"It's not the design of Paris that's the problem, it's that there's not the political will to do enough.\"  Abandoned Climate Efforts The U.S. government in practice abandoned any concern over the climate crisis some time ago, with the Trump administration so far rolling back more than 100 environmental protections, including an Obama-era plan to curb emissions from coal-fired power plants, limits on pollution emitted from cars and trucks and even energy efficiency standards for lightbulbs. In an often chaotic presidency, Trump's position on climate change has been unusually consistent – American fossil fuel production must be bolstered, restrictive climate regulations must be scrapped. Unswayed by growing alarm among Americans over the climate crisis, Trump is taking this same message to the election. \"Biden wants to massively re-regulate the energy economy, rejoin the Paris climate accord, which would kill our energy totally, you would have to close 25% of your businesses and kill oil and gas development,\" the president said this month, without citing evidence, as he announced another rollback, this time of environmental assessments of pipelines, highways and other infrastructure. Despite all this, U.S. emissions have continued to fall, due in large part to the downfall of a coal industry that Trump has attempted to prop up. The international ramifications have been telling, however – in the absence of any sort of positive cajoling from the U.S., global emissions have remained stubbornly high and most countries are lagging behind their own promised actions. According to the Climate Action Tracker, only Morocco is acting consistently with the Paris agreement's goals, with the global temperature rise set to exceed 3C by the end of the century even if the current pledges are met. Paris was meant to be only the beginning – countries are supposed to continually ratchet up their ambition levels until the more extreme ravages of climate change, such as dire flooding, heatwaves, crop failures and the loss of coral reefs, are avoided. \"There's been less political will from other countries to take action to a certain extent because the U.S. isn't pushing for it,\" said Biniaz. \"During the first four years of Trump it's easier to say it's likely to be an aberration, a short-term deviation, but if it's eight years it's harder to keep together the coalition of countries that care about this.\"  ‘Another Meteorite Is Coming’ Another four years of a Trump administration uninterested in the climate crisis could set back global emissions cuts by a decade, according to one published analysis, making the chances of meeting the goals of Paris near to impossible. Hakon Saelen, an environmental economist at the University of Oslo who led the study, said the U.S. withdrawal is a \"significant major blow\" to the mitigation of the climate crisis. \"The world cannot afford any delay if the 2C target is to be reached,\" he said. \"Our model indicates that the chance of reaching it is very low already, but near zero with another Trump term.\" But even with an engaged Biden administration that is somehow able to get Congress to agree to a $2tn plan to shift the U.S. on to renewable energy, the challenge is immense. The world has dithered on cutting emissions for so long that only an unprecedented, rapid overhaul of the way we travel, generate energy and eat will keep humanity within the bounds of safety outlined in Paris. The world will have to slash emissions by more than 7% a year this decade to have any hope of meeting the 1.5C target, The world will have to slash emissions by more than 7% a year this decade to have any hope of meeting the 1.5C target, according to the United Nations . This annual cut will be achievable this year only through the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic, which shuttered much of the global economy. A more sustainable path to decarbonization will need to be immediately identified and implemented.  \"The warmer it gets the worse it gets and the [Paris] targets are broadly at a level where things will get really bad,\" said Zeke Hausfather, director of climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute. \"We don't want people to give up hope, the human race won't become extinct at 2C but that's an unnecessarily high bar. There are still large threats and a lot of good reasons to keep warming below that.

The temperature soared to 115 degrees Fahrenheit — so hot it sucked the breath out of you, made your vision swim and your fingers swell. The wind blew in from the northwest, from the vast, arid Australian interior. Flags flew stiff. Fire danger was extreme.  Joe Milbourne was at home, reading a book on his couch with the air conditioning on and the curtains closed against the harsh February sun. The 59-year-old had retired early from his career as a security guard and had moved into a one-story house at the end of a cul-de-sac in Flowerdale, a small town in the wooded hills above Melbourne.  In the early evening, the lights suddenly turned off and the air conditioner cut out. No worries, Milbourne thought, the wind must have knocked out the power. He turned on a flashlight and kept reading. Then something caught his eye.  \"Between the curtains was a red stripe,\" he remembers. \"I thought, 'It's too early for sunset.' \" He grabbed his hat and his walking stick and went outside to investigate.  The sky was blood red.  By the next morning, 173 people were dead and more than 2,000 homes — including his — were destroyed.

Lucas Dawson / Getty Images People inspect their house in the aftermath of the bushfires in Steels Creek, just south of Kinglake.  The fires of Feb. 7, 2009, were the most deadly ever recorded in Australia — five times more deadly than the country's most recent wildfires, and with twice the number of deaths as in California's Camp Fire in 2018.  In the aftermath, the Australian government was forced to confront an uncomfortable question: Was it safe to allow people to rebuild and live again in the places that had burned?  The Victoria state government eventually offered a choice to hundreds of people in the highest-risk areas who had survived the fires and lost their homes: rebuild to be more fire resistant or sell your land to the government and move somewhere else. The condition was that once land was sold to the government, a home could never be built there again.   Risks of rebuilding  Many policymakers assumed that the more traumatized homeowners were, the more likely they would be to sell their land to the government and relocate, which would lead to fewer people living in harm's way. They assumed the offer of cash payment and a new start would appeal to most people who had watched fire consume their neighborhoods — and would be especially helpful for those who had lost family members in the inferno.  But interviews with 10 survivors of Black Saturday and a review by NPR of more than 50 witness statements given to a government commission suggest that these assumptions were often incorrect. Many who lost houses had already made critical decisions about rebuilding or relocating, long before the public buyback option was even announced. Others who had suffered greatly wanted nothing more than to hold onto the land where their loved ones had lived and died.  / Meredith Rizzo/NPR Kinglake, about an hour's drive northeast of Melbourne, remains a popular place to live in the years since Black Saturday. The town is situated next to a national park and is surrounded by rolling farmland.  In the end, only a small fraction of those who lost their homes on Black Saturday opted to sell their land to the government, and many people rebuilt homes in areas that are extremely prone to fire.  The questions raised by Australia's buyback experiment have become freshly urgent after the country's most recent wildfires and are relevant for other parts of the world where climate change has made large, intense wildfires more likely and where it has become increasingly dangerous to live — including areas of the United States.  \"There's a lot that we can learn in the United States from Australia's tragic experience with bushfire this year and in 2009,\" says Alice Hill, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, D.C., and a former climate policy official in the Obama administration. \"In some instances, it may not make sense to rebuild, given the risk.\"  / Meredith Rizzo/NPR A memorial commemorating the lives lost in the 2009 bushfires was built atop a crest in Frank Thomson Reserve in Kinglake.  But if Australia's experiment after Black Saturday is anything to go on, finding alternatives to rebuilding is easier said than done.   A place to grieve  Donna Wilson puts her pickup truck in gear in the parking lot outside the real estate office she manages and lights a cigarette.  \"I'll take you down here first,\" she says, driving past the pub in the middle of Kinglake, a town 20 miles south of Flowerdale, where Milbourne lives. She points out an empty piece of land. The former owner battled the flames for hours in 2009.  / Meredith Rizzo/NPR Donna Wilson manages a real estate firm in Kinglake that helped the state government with its property buyback program after the 2009 fires.  \"That's a buyback,\" she says.  More than two-thirds of those who died on Black Saturday had lived in the Kinglake area. The public purchase option \"was a godsend for a lot of people\" who were too overwhelmed to list their properties for private sale after the 2009 fire that devastated the town, she says.  But some of those most traumatized by the fire — people who lost loved ones — didn't want to let go of their land, even if they had no intention of rebuilding there.  / Meredith Rizzo/NPR Some people held onto their land following the 2009 fires, Wilson says, turning the lots into memorials instead of choosing to sell or rebuild.  Just outside the town center, she turns down a road with neat single-family homes on 1- and 2-acre lots. The tall, leafy gum trees have regrown in the years since the fire, and it's shady and cool. The street ends in a cul-de-sac with two houses. Wilson stops her truck.  \"This is a memorial,\" she says, pointing into the woods between the two houses.  Sunlight comes through the leaves and cockatoos squawk in the canopy. Eleven years after the tragedy, it's easy to miss the charred flagpole.  The people who lived here in 2009 died here. Their relatives still own the empty lot where their house used to stand. Sometimes they come back to visit.  \"It's a place to grieve,\" Wilson says. \"It's just where they go ...\" she trails off. \"Yeah, it's their choice.\"   Undeterred by fire danger  Fire risk aside, Kinglake remains a popular place to live. The town's population — about 1,500 in 2016, when the most recent Australian census was taken — is slightly bigger than it was in 2006.  There are a couple of new restaurants since 2009 and a bed-and-breakfast. People want to move to Kinglake, Wilson says, although there aren't as many lots available because of new land-use and building-code regulations that were passed after the fires. It's more expensive now to build in high-risk areas like this.  / Meredith Rizzo/NPR Wilson says the post-2009 property buybacks were \"a godsend\" for many people in town but came too late for many others who had already sold their land privately.  On a road where at least 15 people perished in 2009, nearly every lot has a new home. After the fire, she says, people from Kinglake and all the way down in Melbourne snapped up empty properties.  \"These are all new people,\" Wilson says. \"No one is the same, pretty much.\"  One of the biggest lessons learned nationally after the fires was how bureaucratic delays can undercut new regulations.  After Black Saturday, the Victoria government convened a special commission to investigate the fires' causes, the response and what could be done to prevent such a disaster in the future. After more than a year, the commission came back with 67 recommendations, including new building codes and the public buyback program.  Most of the housing recommendations amounted to suggestions about how to build safer homes in fire-prone areas. The buyback recommendation was the only one suggesting that people shouldn't live in those areas at all.  / Meredith Rizzo/NPR The risk of bushfire in Kinglake is high for months each year. Signs around town are adjusted frequently by local firefighters to alert residents of the current bushfire risk.  The government accepted every recommendation except the buyback program. But later, a new state government announced that it intended to move forward with a buyback program, offering to purchase burned land for close to its pre-fire value.  By then, nearly two years had passed since Black Saturday. Many people had already sold their land privately.   Pragmatic relocation  \"This block gives the impression of owning more land,\" says Christine Stonehouse, happily gesturing over a fence in Kinglake to a neighbor's horse paddock.  A thick tangle of gum trees provides shade in the summer. On clear days, there's a view of the hilly Kinglake Ranges. The soil is rich enough to grow flowers and vegetables, which is particularly nice for Stonehouse because her parents owned a local plant nursery for decades.  / Meredith Rizzo/NPR Christine Stonehouse stands next to the site of her former home, which burned down on Black Saturday in 2009. \"Our plan was always to leave,\" she says of her family's decision to flee as soon as it learned a bushfire was headed for its town.  The Stonehouse family considers itself comparatively lucky. The family members had decided early on that they would evacuate if a fire ever threatened their home. \"Our plan was always to leave,\" she says.  On Black Saturday, Stonehouse and her husband loaded their two cars with some photographs, the dog and the cat. As they drove out of town, the sky turned black.  \"We never saw flames,\" says Stonehouse. \"None of us got burned. None of us got injured. Emotionally injured, a bit, but all our family was safe.\"  The day after the fire, a friend called her and her husband to tell them that their home was gone.  \"We cried a lot,\" says Stonehouse.  Within a couple of months, they had rented an apartment back in town and were looking for a contractor to rebuild their home. By late fall of 2009, she says, \"We were ready to rebuild.\"  Meanwhile, that same year, the Victoria government was rolling out its more stringent building standards for wildfire-prone areas. The more susceptible the property was to fire, the more complex and expensive the building standards. Under the new system, the Stonehouse property had the most extreme fire rating. Their building plan did not comply with the new code.  \"We talked to the builder and realized it was going to be very expensive,\" Stonehouse remembers.  Their priority was to find a new place to live, which took about a year. In the meantime, the government began offering to purchase fire-prone land like theirs. If they sold it, no one would ever be able to build a home there again, which was just fine with Stonehouse.  Today, she and her husband live on a slightly larger piece of land on the other side of town, at the top of a hill next to a vegetable farm.  / Meredith Rizzo/NPR Stonehouse transplanted some of her beloved plants to the new property, situated at the top of a hill next to farmland. She says the roses grow well in the open sun.  \"As soon as I saw this, I thought, 'Maybe that is a good place,' \" she says, standing in her garden. She says she feels safe in her new home and is happy with how the post-2009 regulations influenced her family's decision to move.  \"Our new block is in the full sun, so roses grow well,\" she beams.  A policy that came too late  Down the road from Kinglake, Joe Milbourne has spent the last decade recovering from his far more harrowing experience.  On Black Saturday, he watched from the end of his driveway as embers ignited his roof. By the time he reached a neighbor's house, a wall of flame was following him.  \"I thought I was going to die,\" he says.  / Meredith Rizzo/NPR Joe Milbourne barely escaped his burning neighborhood in Flowerdale, a town about 20 miles from Kinglake.  He and his neighbors piled into the neighbor's two cars and drove through thick smoke to an empty field around the corner. The fire had already burned through the grass. The flames made a terrible roaring, sucking sound as they consumed oxygen and fuel.  In the back seat of the car that Milbourne was driving, one of the neighbor's grandchildren sobbed in fear as she watched the tree closest to them glow red.  \"I said, 'Right, lie down and put a blanket over your head,' \" says Milbourne. After 10 minutes, the flames were less intense. \"I said, 'Sit up. Look at [the tree] now. It's just orangish red. I promise you, you're not going to die in a fire.' \"  For months afterward, his town of Flowerdale was an eerie and desolate place. Ten people had died in a town of about 500, and most homes were destroyed. The tallest things standing in Milbourne's neighborhood were sooty gas canisters that had been attached to homes.  William West / AFP via Getty Images Flowerdale lies in ruins after the bushfires devastated the small community in 2009, destroying most homes and killing 10 town residents.  / Meredith Rizzo/NPR Nearly 11 years following the bushfires, Milbourne's neighborhood in Flowerdale has been rebuilt.  Milbourne went to live in a temporary apartment on the other side of town and was trying to figure out how much money he had to work with, either to move or to rebuild.  About six months after the fire, he got his answer: His home insurance would cover the cost of a new home. But Milbourne didn't think his land was worth much, so it didn't make sense to explore selling it and looking for a new place to live. In the fall of 2009, he gave the green light for builders to begin construction of his new house.  A year and a half later, the government announced it would purchase land like his.  \"If I'd known, I wouldn't have built this,\" Milbourne says. \"They were paying pre-fire prices for the blocks [of land]! But I had already started building by the time they announced they were going to do the buyback.\"  Today, Milbourne is focused on being prepared for the next severe bushfire, which he feels will inevitably come. His keeps two enormous drums of water in his yard, which he hopes he can use to soak himself and his home when the surrounding forest begins to burn.  / Meredith Rizzo/NPR Behind his house, Milbourne added two large water tanks to help battle future fires.  The future of public land purchases  Offering to purchase land was a good policy, says Craig Lapsley, who served as fire services commissioner for the state of Victoria after the 2009 fires. It was especially good when combined with stronger building codes that went into effect after the fires. But he says the government took too long to implement it.  \"The policy execution took forever,\" he says. \"It was extremely frustrating, because the details weren't provided for some time and people had to make decisions,\" he explains. \"What do they do? They've got insurance and they've got a piece of land, and [they're wondering] 'What's it all mean to move on?' \"  / Meredith Rizzo/NPR In the years since Black Saturday, homes have been rebuilt and new restaurants have opened in Kinglake. New building regulations have made it more expensive to build in the fire-prone community.  Lapsley says he thinks offering to purchase land after fires might be helpful again in the future. It may even be part of the answer to this season's fires, which have destroyed thousands of homes in the states of Victoria and New South Wales. When NPR asked government officials whether a similar buyback might be introduced this time, they said it was too soon to tell. A special commission has yet to begin reviewing this year's disaster.  But, Lapsley says, it's important to make that option available early, if it's going to be an option at all.  As for Milbourne, he is still trying to put Black Saturday behind him. \"It's been traumatic,\" he says. The stress of rebuilding his house and making sure he's prepared for another fire has affected his health.  \"There are signs in town that say, 'Never Forget,' \" he says. \"Take them down!\"  Forgetting is exactly what he's trying to do.

No one mentioned a microbe; a discussion of the threat of immunity to antibiotics was as close as we got.  Four months later, everyone in that room was under lockdown. COVID-19 hit the world as a freight train hits a car stalled at a railroad crossing. The virus has shredded the rhythm of our daily lives, and it will reconfigure our economies and politics.  How exactly it will do so remains unclear, but this much is certain: across the globe, middle class standards of living depend on the labour and – during a global pandemic – the deaths of an army of cheap migrant workers. The virus has shed light on this dependence, but there is nothing new about it; it has been a basic feature of national and global capitalism since at least the 1970s. And, for all the talk more of a new, more just world that will emerge from the ashes of COVID-19, the world’s addiction to cheap labor is going nowhere.  The virus highlighted the world’s structural dependence on cheap, exploitable labour.  As lockdowns spread around the globe in February (in much of Asia) and March (in much of Europe and North America), low-skilled migrants suffered some combination of four fates: unemployment, internment, expulsion, and infection.  In Turkey, the pandemic slashed domestic growth and foreign remittances, and the first who were sacked were many of the 3.7 million Syrians refugees working in the informal sector. In locked-down Singapore, 30,000 migrant workers were confined to crammed dormitories with as many as twenty bunk beds per rooms. In India, when Prime Minister Modi shut down a country of 1.3 billion people on 24 March, at least 600,000 internal migrants tried to return home – clogging roads and railways in scenes that evoked memories of the great flights and expulsions during partition. As Saudi Arabia entered lockdown, the Kingdom expelled over 2,800 Ethiopian migrants.  SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Never Miss a Beat. Get our best delivered to your inbox.

However, most experimental studies of assortative mating do not take place in multiple natural environments, and hence, they ignore its potential context dependence. We implemented an experiment in which two populations of brown trout ( Salmo trutta ) with different natural flow regimes were placed into semi‐natural stream channels under two different artificial flow regimes. Natural reproduction was allowed, and reproductive isolation was measured by means of parentage assignment to compare within‐population vs. between‐population male–female mating and relative offspring production. For both metrics, reproductive isolation was highly context dependent: no isolation was evident under one flow regime, but strong isolation was evident under the other flow regime. These patterns were fully driven by variance in the mating success of males from one of the two populations. Our results highlight how reproductive isolation through assortative mating can be strongly context dependent, which could have dramatic consequences for patterns of gene flow and speciation under environmental change.  Introduction A key mechanism generating reproductive isolation is positive assortative mating: the tendency of individuals of one type to mate with individuals of the same type rather than individuals of some other type (Andersson, 1994; Maan & Seehausen, 2011; Bolnick & Kirkpatrick, 2012; Servedio & Kopp, 2012; Langerhans & Makowicz, 2013). Positive assortative mating is frequently observed within populations, among populations and among species (Coyne & Orr, 2004; Nosil, 2012; Jiang et al., 2013). Among these levels, conspecific populations are especially interesting because they facilitate the assessment of reproductive barriers that act early in speciation, as opposed to accumulating after the fact (Thibert‐Plante & Hendry, 2009; Nosil, 2012; Servedio & Kopp, 2012). Potential barriers contributing to assortative mating at this stage include habitat preference, reproductive timing and mate choice (Nosil, 2012). Many experiments have assessed assortative mating by measuring the relative success of within‐type vs. between‐type male–female pairings (e.g. Rundle et al., 2000; Nosil et al., 2002; Schwartz et al., 2010). However, most such studies have several limitations with regard to the question at hand. First, they are usually conducted in carefully controlled laboratory environments, which renders uncertain their applicability to reproductive isolation in nature. Second, many experiments employ only crude proxies for assortative mating, such as the relative amount of time females spend with same‐type vs. different‐type males, which might not translate into overall reproductive isolation. Third, most experiments do not use multiple environments and therefore cannot assess the context dependence of assortative mating. Indeed, the strength of assortative mating between any two populations should be context dependent. As one example, sensory drive predicts that the preferences of females for same‐type males will be greatest in the specific environment where the male traits and female preferences evolved (Boughman, 2001, 2002). As another example, female preferences should depend on social factors, such as the preferences of other females (e.g. mate choice copying: Kirkpatrick & Dugatkin, 1994; Briggs et al., 1996; Servedio & Kirkpatrick, 1996) and the number of other males (e.g. females should be pickier when more males are present: Kokko & Monaghan, 2001). As yet another example, female choice should be stronger when the risks associated with carefully assessing males, such as exposure to predators or parasites, are lower (Crowley et al., 1991). This context dependence of assortative mating is critical to evaluate because it dictates the consistency of reproductive barriers and, therefore, the likelihood they will persist in Variable environments. For instance, changes in water clarity that alter the perception of male colours by females have caused speciation reversal in cichlids (Seehausen et al., 1997) and perhaps also in threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus (Lackey & Boughman, 2013). We designed an experiment with goal of reducing or eliminating the above‐mentioned inferential limitations while also assessing context dependence in assortative mating. Our experiment Brown trout (Salmo trutta) are known to express divergence among populations in a number of traits (colour, size, morphology: Jonsson & Jonsson, 2011) that influence mate choice (Petersson et al., 1999; Labonne et al., 2009; Gil et al., 2016). We therefore might expect mating isolation between conspecific populations; yet, explicit tests for such isolation have been rare (Gil et al., 2016). In hopes of detecting ecologically relevant reproductive isolation, we selected two populations from quite different environments: the River Bastan has relatively low and predictable variation in water flow, whereas the River Urumea has higher and less predictable variation in water flow (see Materials and methods). Although these two populations do not differ dramatically in external characters, their different environments suggest the potential for divergence in a number of important ecological traits that might then influence reproductive isolation. Our experiment was conducted in artificial stream reaches that were similar to natural spawning environments (see Materials and methods), increasing the chances that our results would be applicable to reproductive isolation in nature. Further, the use of these semi‐natural reaches allowed us to generate two different environmental conditions so as to assess the context dependence of assortative mating. Specifically, we maintained a constant flow regime in one channel and a variable flow regime in the other channel. We expected this contrast might influence assortative mating because flow regime can influence uncertainty, perceived risk, and the ability and cost to assess and monopolize mates (Allouche & Gaudin, 2001; Petersson & Järvi, 2001; Labonne et al., 2009). A robust method of assessing assortative mating would ideally integrate the various stages at which this barrier could arise. For instance, although many studies focus only on visual observations of male–female interactions, cryptic female choice (e.g. biased use of sperm) could also be important (Birkhead & Pizzari, 2002). We therefore used genetic assignment of offspring among putative parents to quantify assortative mating based on (i) male–female pairings, and (ii) the number of offspring produced conditional on the observed male–female pairings. In our study system, these metrics would not be influenced by intrinsic genetic incompatibilities unrelated to cryptic female choice (or sperm competition) because such incompatibilities are lacking among conspecific populations of salmonids.  Materials and methods Our study populations were the River Bastan (France, +43°16′2.51″, −1°22′32.46″) and the River Urumea (Spain, +43°14′31.81″, −1°55′28.98″). These rivers have similar annual mean discharge (about 6 m3 s−1), watershed areas and land use, but the River Bastan has more predictable flows (daily discharge data for 31 years for Bastan and 17 years for Urumea): several indicators for flow variation have been estimated using IHA software (Richter et al. 1998). For instance, River Bastan has a lower coefficient of variation for annual discharge (1.21 vs. 1.56), generally lower coefficients of dispersion for monthly discharge, and fewer high (9 vs. 10) and low (7 vs. 19) flow events per year (see Appendix S1, details of calculation in Colwell, 1974; Poff & Ward, 1989). The reason for this difference is that the River Bastan is a snow/rain driven system, whereas the River Urumea is a perennial run‐off‐driven system. Adults were collected from the rivers between 21 November and 13 December 2012 by electrofishing and brought back to the laboratory at the Lapitxuri channel (details below), where they were acclimated in separated tanks for 48 h without food. After acclimation, the fish were individually anesthetized (0.3 mL L−1 of 2‐phenoxyethanol), measured to the nearest mm, weighed to the nearest g and photographed using a Pentax K‐R digital camera with dimmed light (Ricoh Imaging Company, Tokyo, Japan). The photographs allowed us to identify individual fish at the beginning and end of the experiment through the position and shape of red and black spots (Appendix S2). This method allowed us to avoid the use of visual or internal tags that might influence mating behaviour and individual condition. Sexual maturity was assessed by gentle squeezing of the belly to reveal the presence of sperm for males and ripe eggs for females. Only mature fish were selected for the experiment. The experiment The experiment was conducted from November 2012 to April 2013 in a controlled channel beside the Lapitxuri Stream (+43°16′59″, −1°28′54″), a tributary to the Nivelle River in south‐western France. The channel has a 2% slope and is fed with natural river water and therefore provides ample food. Temperature variation follows the natural river pattern. It has been used in a number of experiments of reproductive behaviour in salmonid fishes (e.g. Thomaz et al., 1997; Martinez et al., 2000; Hendry & Beall, 2004; Gauthey et al., 2015, 2016) and allows to finely control water flow using valves and a real‐time indicator of discharge. The width of the channel (2.80 m) is comparable to tributaries of either River Urumea or River Bastan. Separate reaches of 30 m each were used to generate two distinct environments with different water flows: constant flow (Constant environment) and variable flow (Variable environment). In the Constant environment, flow was maintained at 210 m3 h−1 (SD = 3.4 m3 h−1) throughout the experiment. In the Variable environment, rapid discharge variations were implemented in cycles of three consecutive modalities: high (360 m3 h−1), intermediate (210 m3 h−1) and low (80 m3 h−1). The duration of each modality for each cycle was drawn randomly from a discrete uniform distribution (1–4 days), which was reasonably comparable to natural conditions. However, the rate of water level change was much faster (about 1–3 min) than in nature. Within each of the two environments, the channel was divided into three sequential 10–m‐long sections. The middle section was optimized for spawning, with 5–20 mm substrate sizes and 10–20 cm water depths at intermediate discharge. By contrast, the upstream and downstream sections were optimized for hiding and resting, with 40–80 mm gravel, up to 60 cm water depth and visual obstacles. The fish were free to move between the three sections within each environment but could not move between environments. Upstream passage was prevented by an impassable obstacle. Downstream passage was prevented by a net trap. Whenever an adult fish was caught in the net trap, it was released back into its environment. Between 21 November and 13 December, fish were released into the channels as they matured, with similar body sizes, numbers and sex ratios released into each environment on each release date. Thirty‐three females and 19 males were released in the Constant environment, and 31 females and 19 males were released in the Variable environment (phenotypic data available in Appendix S3). The relative number of males and females were chosen so to maximize the number of potential matings (thus more females) while still providing ample phenotypic variation in both sexes. No significant body size difference was detected between males of both origins released in Constant (Wilcoxon, P = 0.05212) or Variable (Wilcoxon, P = 0.7696) environments, as well as between females of both origins in Constant (Wilcoxon, P = 0.2291) or Variable (Wilcoxon, P = 0.9367) environment. The fish were then removed from the channel by electrofishing on 13 February 2013, 2 weeks after the last observed reproductive activity (digging or antagonistic behaviours). All fish were anesthetized, measured and weighed (as above) and were then stripped to assess any remaining eggs or sperm. In addition, a small piece of caudal fin was removed to perform genetic analysis (details below). Each fish was identified based on the pictures taken before reproduction and was then released into its original river after 48 h. Seventy‐five days after the first reproduction (corresponding to 800 degree days), we began collecting daily drifting juveniles in the net traps. A subsample was kept for genetic analysis. Specifically, up to 20 juveniles were taken randomly from the traps each day per environment (irrespective of the total number of juveniles trapped). Ninety days after the last observed reproductive activity, the few remaining juveniles were electrofished, and 20% were also kept at random. This subsampling represented 98.8% (Constant) and 84.3% (Variable) of the total number of caught juveniles. Juveniles were killed with a lethal dose of 2‐phenoxyethanol and placed individually in a tube of 90° ethanol for later genetic parentage analysis. Parentage analysis DNA was extracted using NaCl/chloroform, and eight microsatellites previously developed for salmonids were amplified: Str60INRA, Str73INRA (Estoup et al., 1993), Ssa85 (O'Reilly et al., 1996), SsoSL438 and SsoSL417 (Slettan et al., 1995), SSsp2216 (Paterson et al., 2004), and Ssa410Uos and Ssa408Uos (Cairney et al., 2000). We used a multiplex protocol allowing amplification of the eight loci in one polymerase chain reaction (multiplex PCR), following (Lerceteau‐Köhler & Weiss, 2006). Fragments were sized on an ABI 3100‐Avant (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MD, USA) using a GeneScan 500 LIZ internal size standard (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Maryland, USA). They were then scored using STRand software (Toonen & Hughes, 2001), and raw allele sizes were binned into discrete allele classes using the MSatAllele package (Alberto, 2009) for R version 2.13.0 (R Core Team 2011). We used the ‘parents pair analysis, sexes known’ option in Cervus (version 3.0.3, Kalinowski, 2002) to assign parents to each sampled offspring based on allele frequencies computed from genotypes of the candidate parents. The following simulation parameters were used: 10 000 cycles, 33 candidate mothers and 19 candidate fathers in the Constant environment, 31 candidate mothers and 19 candidate fathers in Variable environment, a mistyping error rate of 1%, and a genotyping error rate of 1%. All juveniles with more than one locus missing (1.4% of the total) were removed from the analysis. We accepted parentage assignment at a confidence level of 95% and only when the juvenile was assigned to both parents, which excluded 0.3% of the total. Finally, the genetic distance between the populations was calculated using Weir & Cockerham's (1984) θ on adult genotypes, with a bootstrap method to determine significance (N = 10 000, Geneland Software, Guillot et al., 2005). Assortative mating 2014 M between represents the number of matings between populations, and M within represents the number of matings within populations. The second index estimated assortative mating based on relative reproductive success conditional on having mated (number of offspring detected per successful pair): O between represents the number of genotyped offspring produced by pairs from different populations, and O within represents then number of offspring produced by pairs from the same population. For both metrics, a −1 value would indicate total negative assortative mating between populations, a 0 value would indicate a random mating, and a 1 value would indicate total positive assortative mating between populations. This approach is especially powerful when population size and sex ratio are known, as they were in the present case, because we can precisely calculate the expected outcome under a panmictic gene flow scenario (Martin & Willis, 2007 Reproductive success calculated from parentage assignment resulted in a matrix of non‐negative integers for the number of offspring assigned to all possible pairs of males and females in each environment (Appendix S4). From this matrix, two indexes were calculated separately for each environment based on Sobel & Chen (). The first index estimated assortative mating based on mating success (indirect measure: at least one offspring detected for a given male–female pair):whererepresents the number of matings between populations, andrepresents the number of matings within populations. The second index estimated assortative mating based on relative reproductive success(number of offspring detected per successful pair):whererepresents the number of genotyped offspring produced by pairs from different populations, andrepresents then number of offspring produced by pairs from the same population. For both metrics, a −1 value would indicate total negative assortative mating between populations, a 0 value would indicate a random mating, and a 1 value would indicate total positive assortative mating between populations. This approach is especially powerful when population size and sex ratio are known, as they were in the present case, because we can precisely calculate the expected outcome under a panmictic gene flow scenario (Martin & Willis,). To determine whether AM ms and AM rs were greater or lesser than expected by chance in each environment, we calculated expected values under a panmictic scenario using a bootstrap approach. For AM ms , we generated 10 000 new matrices of mating success by randomizing pairs of males and females and attributing an observed mating success to each new pair. That is, the observed matings (number of offspring per pair) were assigned to new pairs of parents chosen at random from all possible pairs in a given environment. For each simulated matrix, this randomized AM ms was calculated and compared to the observed AM ms . The same approach was used for AM rs , although we calculated the expected random reproductive success conditioned by the observed matings: pairs of individuals that actually mated were randomly assigned observed reproductive success values. This last calculation allowed us to check more precisely if observed AM rs values were solely driven by variation in mating success (i.e. AM ms ) or if they instead could include some cryptic mate choice or additional post‐zygotic isolation.  Results Adults from the two populations were strongly genetically differentiated at the examined microsatellite loci (θ = 0.147, P < 0.00001, see Appendix S4), which suggests the potential for reproductive barriers to have evolved and for our methods to reveal them. A total of 1305 juveniles were captured and genotyped, with only 18 being excluded owing to missing data at more than one locus (Constant environment = 13; Variable environment = 5). In the Constant environment, 555 juveniles were successfully genotyped and 552 could be assigned to both parents (95% confidence level). In the Variable environment, 732 juveniles were successfully genotyped and 731 juveniles could be assigned to both parents. In the Constant environment, three Bastan adults (two males and one female) escaped at the beginning of the experiment and one Bastan female died. Only one offspring was assigned to each of the females (none to the males) and so these four individuals (and the two juveniles sired) were excluded from further analyses. Parentage analysis revealed at least 40 successful mating pairs in the Constant environment and 55 successful mating pairs in the Variable environment (Table 1). Out of the 63 total females, only five (Constant environment: one from Urumea population; Variable environment: three from Bastan population and one from Urumea population) were still at least partially ovigerous at the end of the experiment, indicating that they had not deposited all (or any) of their eggs. Only seven offspring were assigned to these females – all to the Urumea female in the Constant environment. Table 1. The number of inferred mating pairs between (M between ) and within (M within ) populations, the number of inferred offspring between (O between ) and within (O within ) populations, and the associated assortative mating indexes (AM ms and AM rs ) M between M within AM ms O between O within AM rs Constant environment 17 23 0.15 246 302 0.11 Variable environment 17 38 0.38 210 521 0.43 The total number of matings inferred per male ranged between 0 and 11 in the Constant environment (mean was 2.83 for Bastan males and 2.09 for Urumea males) and between 0 and 15 in the Variable environment (mean was 5.5 for Bastan males and 0.91 for Urumea males). The total number of matings inferred per female ranged between 0 and 4 in the Constant environment (mean was 1.29 for Bastan females and also 1.29 for Urumea females) and between 0 and 5 in the Variable environment (mean was 2.06 for Bastan females and 1.5 for Urumea females, Appendix S5). The total number of offspring inferred per male ranged between 0 and 201 in the Constant environment (mean was 43.75 for Bastan males and 26.45 for Urumea males) and between 0 and 270 in the Variable environment (mean was 73.75 for Bastan males and 6.27 for Urumea males). The total number of offspring inferred per female ranged between 0 and 86 in the Constant environment (mean was 11.35 for Bastan females and 25.5 for Urumea females) and between 0 and 112 in the Variable environment (mean was 24.62 for Bastan females and 18.93 for Urumea females, Appendix S6). In the Constant environment, assortative mating based on mating pairs was low and not significantly different from zero (AM ms = 0.15, P = 0.87), implying random mating between individuals from the two populations (Fig. 1). In the Variable environment, however, assortative mating was more than twice as high as in the Constant environment and was significantly different from zero (AM ms = 0.38, P = 0.002), implying positive assortative mating. The reason for this assortment was that Bastan males achieved higher than random mating success with females from Bastan but not with females from Urumea. By contrast, males from Urumea had lower than random mating success with females from both populations (Fig. 2). Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Assortative mating based on mating pairs (AM ms ) in (a) Environment C (constant water flow) and (b) Environment V (variable water flow). The shaded areas represent expected distribution of AM ms under a panmictic scenario. Arrows show the observed values for AM ms . Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Observed numbers of mates (arrows) and expected numbers of mates (density probability) calculated under a panmictic scenario between Bastan and Urumea populations in (a) Constant environment and (b) Variable environment. Grey arrows indicate that the observed number of mates falls within expected values for a panmictic scenario, whereas black arrows indicate a significant difference between observed and expected number of mates. A similar pattern was obtained when considering relative numbers of offspring produced per mating pair: in the Constant environment, AM rs = 0.11 and in the Variable environment, AM rs = 0.43 (Table 1). However, after accounting for realized mating pairs (offspring produced conditional on a mating having occurred), neither values of AM rs was significantly different from zero (Constant: P = 0.3189; Variable: P = 0.168). This result shows that variation in AM rs was fully driven by variation in AM ms (whether or not a pair mated) as opposed to differential numbers of offspring produced per mating pair, and it therefore also implies lack of cryptic mate choice.  Discussion Our experiment revealed the context dependence of assortative mating between two brown trout populations (Fig. 1). In one environment, assortative mating was absent with respect to successful male–female pairings and with respect to total offspring production. In the other environment, assortative mating was strong with respect to both of these metrics, with no added contribution from differential offspring production conditional on the type of pairing. This assortative mating was presumably driven by behavioural interactions because spatial and temporal isolation were absent, intrinsic genetic incompatibilities are lacking, factors typically involved in intrasexual competition and intersexual preference (body size, OSR) did not differ, and cryptic mate choice did not make a substantial contribution. This strong context dependence in mate choice was closely associated with variation in male mating success. In the first environment, males of both origins had similar mating success and males of neither population showed a preference for females from their home population. In the second environment, males from one population had much lower mating success than did males from the other population, with the latter showing strong assortative mating (Fig. 2). Our study thus demonstrates that assortative mating is strongly context dependent in semi‐natural environments; yet, key elements of the experimental design dictate that some inferences about causality and generality remain speculative. First, our use of only two populations and only two experimental environments means that inferences are specific to those two populations and those two environments. That is, the lack of replication of each source population type (i.e. high flow variation vs. low flow variation) and each experimental treatment (constant flow vs. variable flow) means that we cannot confidently infer whether (i) adaptation to different flow regimes causes assortative mating or (ii) whether the context dependence was driven specifically by variation in flow regimes. Second, the use of wild‐caught individuals means that assortative mating could reflect some unknown combination of genetic differences, plasticity and prior experience. Of course, each of these design elements is typical in many previous studies asserting inferences about assortative mating in fishes and other taxa. Their presence in our study reflects the trade‐offs associated with the logistical challenges of allowing near‐natural reproductive behaviour in relatively large and long‐lived fish. Context dependence of assortative mating within the experiment Much of available knowledge on assortative mating in salmonids focuses on body size as the primary variable driving mate choice (Blanchfield & Ridgway, 1999; Petersson et al., 1999; Labonne et al., 2009); but, as previously mentioned, body size was similar between our populations and experimental treatments. Assortative mating, and its context dependence in our experiment, must therefore be shaped by other mechanisms. Although it is difficult to conclusively infer what these mechanisms might be, we can at least rule out some typical expectations. First, although intrasexual competition in females influences mating patterns in salmonids (Quinn, 1999; Adkinson et al., 2014), nearly all females in our experiment laid eggs and mated in both environments. Second, although intrasexual competition in males can be even more important (Petersson et al., 1999), it does not explain why mating success of Bastan males is higher with Bastan females than it is with Urumea females in the Variable environment. Evidence against the importance of intrasexual selection leads naturally to a consideration of intersexual selection, which is usually thought to play a lesser role in mating success variation in salmonids (Petersson et al., 1999). On the male side, choosiness is assumed to be weak because dominant males can most effectively maximize their overall reproductive success by simply by moving from female to female depending on their readiness to release eggs (Kokko & Monaghan, 2001). Indeed, in our experiment, no evidence emerged that males of either population actively discriminated against females of either population in either environment (Fig. 2). On the female side, choosiness is more documented and may in fine play a significant role in the mating patterns (Labonne et al., 2009; Gil et al., 2016). In our experiment, we suggest that female‐driven intersexual selection could be a primary driver of assortative mating and its context dependence. For instance, Bastan females mated almost exclusively with Bastan males, whereas Urumea females seem to be considerable less discriminant and these differences were most dramatic in the Variable environment (Fig. 2). This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that female reproductive investment differed between the two populations only in the Variable environment (both weight variation and energetic plasma metabolites variations during reproductive season were lower in Urumea than Bastan Females: Gauthey et al., 2016). Why would female preference for same‐population males be context dependent? Work on other taxa suggests that such preferences are strongly influenced by various aspects of the local environment (Crowley et al., 1991; Candolin, 1997; Seehausen et al., 1997; Evans et al., 2002; Atwell & Wagner, 2015). In the present context, we cannot be certain why flow regime might drive variation in choosiness that then shapes assortative mating. However, it is certainly true that variation in this environmental variable seems likely to influence a number of factors, such as predation risk (Allouche & Gaudin, 2001), female aggressiveness and maternal care (Labonne et al., 2009), and possibly female deception (Petersson & Järvi, 2001), because the energetic cost of these behaviours is probably dependent on flow intensity. Further work will be needed to assess these, and other, possibilities.  Conclusions and implications Our finding that two conspecific trout populations show positive assortative mating in one environmental context (experimental treatment) but not in another has several important implications. First, it confirms that assortative mating can be present between closely related and geographically proximate populations, which complements previous studies of salmonids that used genetic markers (e.g. Hendry et al., 2000; Pearse et al., 2009). Unlike those previous studies, however, we have here uncovered a specific reproductive barrier: assortative mating likely driven by female choice. Second, the striking context dependence of the assortative mating means that the strength of a reproductive barrier can depend critically on the specific local conditions. Although this outcome was not unexpected (see Introduction), it nevertheless highlights the need for experimental studies of assortative mating to employ multiple, ecologically relevant environments (see also Berdan & Fuller, 2012). Such context dependence might explain a lot of the variation in reproductive isolation in natural systems, although it remains difficult in our system – and others – to pinpoint the most important causal factor(s). The context dependence of mating isolation could have important implications in relation to environmental change. If, for example, flow regimes really are the reason for context dependence in our experiment, we might be concerned with how such regimes will change in the future, with a frequent prediction being an increase in stochasticity (Milly et al., 2002; IPCC 2013). Depending on the specific populations and environments, our results imply that mating isolation could increase or decrease, which could have a number of potential consequences. As one example, an increase in mating isolation should reduce gene flow which could then reduce the potential for adaptation to changing conditions (e.g. Bell & Gonzalez, 2011). Decreasing gene flow might also increase the potential for inbreeding, which could then depress population fitness in a number of ways (Kirkpatrick & Barton, 1997; Verhoeven et al., 2011). By contrast, a decrease in mating isolation could reduce the distinctiveness of unique populations, thus comprising among‐population diversity. Indeed, just such effects have been observed for cichlids (Seehausen et al., 1997) and stickleback (Boughman, 2001). The key point is that we should be not only assessing the effects of environmental change on evolution within populations but also on interactions between them, specifically the degree of mating isolation and therefore gene flow.

The immunization was safe, effective, and widely available. Most insurance companies planned to cover it. But few people were taking it.  That epidemic was human papillomavirus, or HPV, a sexually transmitted infection that sometimes causes cervical cancer and other serious conditions. In 2006, after federal regulators approved the first HPV vaccine, the CDC officially recommended that all adolescent girls be immunized. In 2011, the agency extended the recommendation to boys, too.  But uptake of the vaccine was, by all accounts, abysmal. So the agency launched a campaign to promote the importance of the HPV vaccine.  Extensive fact sheets, created by a consulting firm and released on the CDC’s website, addressed parents’ concerns that the vaccine would encourage their kids to become sexually active. Doctors and nurses began delivering talking points, provided by the CDC’s communications team and disseminated by partners such as the Immunization Action Coalition, a foundation-, industry-, and government-funded nonprofit, that touted the vaccine’s cancer-preventing qualities.  Immunizations jumped. By 2017, 49 percent of adolescents were up to date with the HPV vaccine.  Related Some Chiropractors Get Political on Vaccines  That figure is still below CDC goals. But the HPV campaign, focusing on a vaccine that is entirely optional and given after early childhood, has become the subject of extensive research in the years since. And, as scientists edge closer to finalizing vaccines for Covid-19, lessons from HPV and other vaccine messaging campaigns are suddenly more relevant than ever.  Indeed, while it’s possible a vaccine could be approved for public use as early as this fall, and widely available sometime next year, it’s unclear how many Americans will be willing to take it. Many analysts are optimistic that an effective vaccine will be welcomed, but surveys indicate widespread suspicion. Officials appear to be preparing a response: In early July, CDC Director Robert Redfield testified at a Senate hearing that the agency has spent months developing a plan to build Covid-19 vaccine confidence, though he offered few details.  A preliminary CDC vaccine rollout plan, published in mid-September, describes good communication as “essential” to “a successful Covid-19 vaccination program,” and notes the agency will “engage and use a wide range of partners, collaborations, and communication and news media channels” in an effort to reach different audiences.  “There’s often this assumption that if we build it, they will come,” said Kaitlin Christenson, vice president of vaccine acceptance and demand at the Sabin Vaccine Institute, a global nonprofit funded by a mix of government, pharmaceutical industry, and foundation sources. “But even the most effective vaccine is not going to produce results if it isn’t taken up and delivered effectively.”  Sometimes overlooked, vaccine messages — from brochures in doctor’s offices to Instagram posts — are as vital to a vaccine campaign as the vaccine itself, some experts say. Over the years, vaccine messaging specialists have homed in on tactics, from those generating fear to others that evoke community values, that can boost compliance.  But results have been mixed, and fundamental debates remain over the best messaging strategies. And it’s not yet clear what Covid-19 vaccine messaging campaigns — launched amid a global pandemic unfolding in the shadow of intense political polarization — will look like, let alone if they will work.  Before the early 2000s, said Glen Nowak, a health communications expert at the University of Georgia and former communications director for the CDC’s National Immunization Program, CDC leadership believed that vaccines needed little fanfare to convince the public of their value. Up until then, Nowak said, it was “assumed that vaccines will speak for themselves.” Policymakers also often leaned on state day care and school vaccination mandates to win compliance.  But “telling people to do something because you say so isn’t a really effective way of getting them to feel confident,” Nowak added. He recalled that when flu recommendations changed to include children in the early 2000s, it became “clear that public and provider communications would be needed to foster awareness and compliance with the new recommendations.” The HPV vaccine, released a few years later, underscored the idea that just posting new vaccine guidelines wasn’t enough.  With the advent of Facebook and other online social media in the 2000s, anti-vaccine messages proliferated online, sharing stories of children harmed by vaccines. At the same time, more parents began taking advantage of philosophical and religious exemption policies that let them send their kids to school unvaccinated. That trend raised alarm among public health experts and created a need for persuasive messaging, wrote Xiaoli Nan, director of the University of Maryland’s Center for Health and Risk Communication, in an email.  Today, the creation of vaccine messages, sitting at the intersection of marketing and medicine, can take months or years to unfold. Sometimes the process is spearheaded by vaccine manufacturers, hospitals, or pharmacies. Often, though, the campaigns are the work of government agencies trying to boost vaccine use or address looming concerns among hesitant parents.  The CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases has a contract with a communications firm that develops millions of dollars’ worth of educational materials and campaigns, mostly directed at flu and HPV messaging, according to Nowak. It also has its own communications team to develop materials, targeting messages based on data from the previous year about who did – or did not – have high vaccination rates.  Today, the creation of vaccine messages, sitting at the intersection of marketing and medicine, can take months or years to unfold.  In recent years, vaccine messaging has proliferated to include Twitter accounts, TV commercials, online ads, satirical campaigns, cartoon characters, doctor education efforts, brochures, posters, billboards, radio ads, and even dedicated YouTube channels.  What makes for an effective messaging campaign, though, is a more elusive question. Jody Tate, director of research and policy for the Health Policy Partnership, a consultancy, said effective messaging digs into survey and focus group data to understand people’s reluctance — whether it’s based on concerns about safety, or something more fundamental, such as a language barriers or access to medical care — and then tailors itself accordingly.  Who delivers those messages is also crucial, Tate said. Overwhelmingly, surveys find that doctors and nurses are the most trusted sources of vaccine information. A 2018 Wellcome Global Monitor survey found that roughly three-quarters of adults around the world trust their doctor or nurse ahead of family and friends, religious leaders, and celebrities. Doctors “are the ideal messengers,” Nan wrote.  Rejecting the flash of some advertising, many experts favor a simple, fact-based approach. And simple messages, repeated often, can potentially be effective, said Christopher E. Clarke, a health and environmental risk communication scholar at George Mason University. (Indeed, in a metanalysis of 14 years’ worth of influenza-related communications by the CDC, Nowak found that “visible and frequent reminders” raised vaccination rates).  Experts are divided, though, on whether a straightforward tell-the-facts approach is really enough. “There is growing evidence that traditional communication of vaccines — e.g., messages focusing on statistics — has not worked well,” Nan wrote. “More successful strategies,” she added, “rely on trustworthy messengers, telling stories rather than using statistics, and appeals to moral values.”  For all of Undark’s coverage of the global Covid-19 pandemic, please visit our extensive coronavirus archive.  In 1999, when Nowak, then director of communications for the CDC’s immunization program, looked at why more people 65 years and older weren’t getting the flu vaccine, he discovered they didn’t think the CDC’s fact-based materials — which urged high-risk groups, including the frail and elderly, to get vaccinated — applied to them. They were, after all, in their 60s and 70s. They weren’t frail or elderly, they told Nowak in focus groups. They were healthy and active.  Over the years, the agency has remade its flu and other vaccine messaging to be more positive and appeal to people’s desire to stay healthy and maintain their quality of life.  Positive framing has proven, in some cases, to work well. A study published this May, which looked specifically at HPV vaccine messaging, found that negatively worded messages could actually increase the perception of risk associated with taking vaccine itself. “Negative messaging was not a good way to communicate,” said Porismita Borah, an author of the study and an associate professor of communications at Washington State University. Kelly Moore, associate director for immunization education at the Immunization Action Coalition (IAC) and a former CDC adviser, said that “fear and uncertainty can lead to inaction.”  Instead, she said, “it is messages that are positive — messages of hope and optimism and empowerment — that encourage people to take action, because they believe that by what they are doing, they can change their destiny.”  But some experts argue that fear can offer a more effective push. The chickenpox vaccine was licensed and recommended for all children in 1995. But its uptake was poor for the first few years, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a frequent government adviser on vaccine policy who also helped invent a rotavirus vaccine that is produced by Merck.  “It is messages that are positive — messages of hope and optimism and empowerment — that encourage people to take action, because they believe that by what they are doing, they can change their destiny,” said Borah.  “I think people thought of chickenpox as a benign right of childhood passage,” he said. But as many as 13,000 people were hospitalized and 150 people died each year in the early 1990s as a result of chickenpox — and the vaccine’s maker, Merck, used those figures to create a more aggressive advertising TV commercial campaign, which included interviews with parents who had lost children to chickenpox. “It was dramatic, and they were criticized for that,” Offit said. But the campaign, in conjunction with increasing public school mandates, also worked: By 2014, 91 percent of U.S. children 19 to 35 months old had received one dose of the vaccine.  Similarly, HPV vaccine messaging has sometimes preyed on people’s fear: In 2016, for example, its maker, also Merck, ran ads that featured adults with cervical cancer, asking their parents if they knew a vaccine could have prevented it. Some research suggests that, at least when it comes to the HPV vaccine, anticipated regret can be a powerful motivator.  “What convinces people?” Offit asked. “Sadly, I think fear is more powerful than reason.”  Some vaccine messaging campaigns simply fail. And some messengers can also endanger messaging campaigns.  In 2002, fearing that terrorists would use smallpox as a weapon, President George W. Bush ordered half a million military members to be vaccinated against the disease before launching a voluntary program for health care and emergency workers the following year. Amid concerns that the vaccine wasn’t safe, he had himself vaccinated and announced it to the press.  But fewer than 40,000 health care workers accepted vaccination. Some people still didn’t feel the vaccine, which can cause rare but serious complications, was safe. The administration didn’t consult with doctors, critics say, and didn’t anticipate that politics would play a role in people’s decision to be vaccinated. The program was launched just months before the U.S. went to war with Iraq, and many liberals believed the vaccination campaign was propaganda.  Today’s climate poses a distinctive, uncharted challenge: No other vaccine has been made at such breakneck speed, amid such publicity, and with such political division, said Clarke.  “There is no precedent for” this challenge, he said.  With at least several months likely remaining until the most ambitious Covid-19 vaccine will potentially go to market, a recent Gallup survey found that around one in three Americans say they would not get a free, FDA-approved Covid-19 vaccine. Surveys also suggest that Black Americans are more hesitant about the vaccine than White Americans — potentially a legacy of longstanding discrimination against Black people in the health care system.

The country has been divided along partisan lines on many preventative measures against Covid-19. That “political divide will likely spill over to the upcoming Covid-19 vaccine,” warned Nan, who, like Clarke, believes tailoring messaging to people’s political or religious views could be essential to uptake. While other kinds of public messaging campaigns match messages with the receiver’s worldview, Nan explained the technique has rarely been used in vaccination messaging.  But Graham Dixon, a science and risk communication professor at The Ohio State University, said that a Covid-19 vaccine messaging strategy that presents a consensus not only in the scientific community, but among policymakers, could be effective in increasing vaccination. “There has been a great deal of political polarization in this issue,” he said, “and it’s almost inevitable that people’s decision to get a Covid-19 vaccine will land in the same way if we don’t create a messaging strategy that emphasizes a depoliticized message.”  In the past, other messaging campaigns have drawn on anti-polarization strategies to try to build consensus around contentious issues. A climate change awareness campaign from 2008, for example, featured famous political adversaries — including the left-wing pastor Al Sharpton and the right-wing evangelist Pat Robertson — sitting together on couches, talking about their shared concern about the environment.  “If and when a Covid-19 vaccine becomes available, messaging should be consistent across the political spectrum, and in a perfect world should feature influential leaders from the Republican and Democratic parties,” Dixon wrote in a follow-up email. But, he added, it was probably “wishful thinking to believe that Joe Biden and Donald Trump would appear together in a PSA encouraging Covid-19 vaccination.”  Despite what Redfield has described as months of planning at the CDC for how to build vaccine confidence, it’s unlikely the agency will unveil official campaigns until a vaccine goes to market.  Asked in July for details about its plan, a CDC spokesperson sent Undark a link to the agency’s existing framework for vaccinating with confidence and referred further questions to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. HHS declined repeated requests for comment and provided only unattributed information via email, writing that Operation Warp Speed (OWS) — the federal initiative to deliver 300 million doses of a safe and effective Covid-19 vaccine by January 2021 — is committed to “maximum transparency.”  Since then, CDC has released some additional details of the campaign as part of a 57-page “interim playbook” that outlines vaccination plans for local and state public health officials.  Some journalists, legislators, and scientists have accused OWS of a lack of transparency about its process for selecting vaccine candidates. That opacity, critics say, exacerbates concerns over any potential vaccines’ safety and efficacy.  If the operation’s name foreshadows more messaging from government agencies, experts caution there is reason to be wary. “The term ‘warp speed’ was an unfortunate term,” Offit said. That particular message, he said, suggests corners are being cut to create a vaccine.  “Constantly saying you’re going fast makes people think you’re going recklessly fast,” said Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine.  But, Dixon added, it was probably “wishful thinking to believe that Joe Biden and Donald Trump would appear together in a PSA encouraging Covid-19 vaccination.”  Beth Bell, a clinical professor of global health at the University of Washington and member of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said she’s not sure how the name came about. (The committee is not directly involved in the nuts and bolts of vaccine messaging.) “I think those of us who are looking at recommendations are quite serious about not cutting corners and not sacrificing safety for speed,” Bell said.  To convince Americans already concerned about vaccine safety to take a vaccine developed at record — or warp — speed, transparency will be key: “Loud and clear throughout this period of preparation, and when a vaccine is available, it’s going to need to be very clear what we know about the vaccine, and frankly, what we don’t know,” said Jason Schwartz, a health policy scholar at Yale University.  Experts believe that vaccine messaging that presents more information — even if that information is incomplete, or changes as more evidence emerges — can sway people toward vaccine confidence. “I understand why members of the public are skeptical and hesitant right now,” said Moore, the Immunization Action Coalition staffer, during a conversation in July. “Someone recently asked me if I would take the first vaccine that rolls off the line, and I said, ‘I would like to see the data and then I’ll make my decision.’ If that’s my approach, then I respect others for having the same approach.”  Nonetheless, experts hope that a safe, effective vaccine — and any messaging that accompanies it — will be welcomed by the majority of Americans who will have to receive it to reach herd immunity.  “I’d like to think it would be like the end of the movie ‘Contagion,’” Offit said, “where everybody’s lining up to get this vaccine.”  Jillian Kramer is a journalist whose work has appeared in The New York Times, National Geographic, Scientific American, and more.

Extinction Rebellion protesters have boarded the Valaris 122 jack-up and are planning an “extended occupation” of the platform at Princess Alexandra Wharf.   © DC Thomson  A group of three women, one of them from Dundee, has scaled the rig, accessing it from the River Tay.  Two of them are making their way up one of the rig’s towers using climbing gear.  Extinction Rebellion say its activists plan on remaining on the rig “as long as possible” in an effort to prevent it from returning to oil and gas operations.  The Dundee protester’s name was given only as Alison.  The UK Coastguard and Port of Dundee pilot boats are at the scene.  Police and the Scottish Ambulance Service have also been spotted at the scene.  As of 5.30pm, the force said no arrests had been made at the rig.  The occupation is said to be a part of a campaign called “Rig Rebellion Two” which is targeting the north-east oil and gas industry.   © DC Thomson  Extinction Rebellion Scotland said the takeover of the rig will be the start of 10 days of action.  As reported in Energy Voice, according to Valaris’ latest fleet status report the 122 rig is scheduled to carry out a contract for Shell beginning on January 20.  A press release from Extinction Rebellion Scotland reads: “Australia is on fire. Half a billion animals have perished. Jakarta is flooded with 30,000 evacuated from their homes.  “Norway is experiencing an unprecedented heatwave. The Antarctic ice sheet is melting, with daily ice losses 50 years ahead of schedule.  “100 companies are to blame for 71% of carbon emissions. 20 companies, almost of all of which are fossil fuel companies, are responsible for a third of all carbon emissions.  “This morning, Extinction Rebellion Scotland activists boarded a Shell gas rig currently parked in Dundee Harbour, which is destined for the North Sea.  “They have scaled the towers and intend to stay up there for as long as possible to stop the rig leaving the harbour, and to halt the rig’s extractive and destructive operations.  “They have assessed the risks and are properly prepared.”  BREAKING: 3 XR Scotland rebels have boarded and climbing a Shell Gas Rig in Dundee.

I don’t want to say to her that I didn’t take a stand when I had the choice and left it to other people to sort it out.  “I am going to give it my best shot and go down fighting, because I can see the world through her eyes and I want to protect things for her.”  A spokesman for Forth Ports, the harbour’s operator, said: “Earlier today, Forth Ports was made aware that a number of apparent protesters had made their way via the River Tay to the Valaris 122 jack-up rig, which is currently berthed at Princess Alexandra Wharf at the Port of Dundee.  “We have deployed one of our pilot boats at the scene and this will remain in attendance as a safety precaution should anyone require assistance.  “We are also liaising with the rig’s owners and with the relevant authorities.”  Oil and Gas UK chief executive Deirdre Michie hit out at the activists, claiming it is a “dangerous and short-sighted stunt”.  She said the protest “does absolutely nothing to help provide the solutions which will be required to meaningfully deliver net zero emissions by 2045 in Scotland”.  She added that a “premature shutdown” of the North Sea oil and gas industry would “only increase reliance on oil and gas imported from across the world where we have no control over emissions” and impact on jobs, public services and energy security.  Ms Michie said: “This stunt puts both the activists and offshore workforce at risk and our industry – with its focus on safe operations – will not condone these actions.  “If Extinction Rebellion is serious about net zero then it needs to become serious about what will be required and recognise the critical contribution our industry could make if it realises its full potential to support the transition to a lower carbon and more diverse energy mix.”  However Greenpeace UK climate campaigner Mel Evans jumped to the defence of the Extinction Rebellion members.  She said: “The XR Scotland activists currently braving the January weather to occupy a Shell rig in Dundee are right to call out the oil industry’s role in causing the climate crisis.  “As the Australian bushfires rage and Jakarta goes underwater the world is beginning to see what a fossil-fuelled climate emergency looks like.  “2020 is set to be a year of increasing climate activism building up to the international climate talks in Glasgow in November.  “Greenpeace supports XR Scotland’s demand for corporations and government, in Holyrood and Westminster, to start phasing down North Sea oil and gas production to help prevent catastrophic climate change.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 16, "positive": 27, "negative": 3, "joy": 1, "anger": 23, "surprise": 1, "fear": 6, "trust": 6}, "metadata": ["climate", "activists", "extinction", "rebellion", "princess", "uk", "campaign", "unprecedented", "fossil", "fuel", "intend", "risks", "calling", "confront", "claiming", "solutions", "emissions", "reliance", "workforce", "contribution", "greenpeace", "causing", "australian", "bushfires", "talks", "glasgow"]}, {"text": "Ed Miliband in shock Labour comeback as Keir Starmer appoints him to his Shadow Cabinet  Ed Miliband was Labour leader from 2010 until 2015.  Ed Miliband has returned to frontline politics after being given a job in Keir Starmer's first Shadow Cabinet as Labour leader.  The former leader has been appointed Shadow Business Secretary, replacing Rebecca Long-Bailey, who is moved to be Shadow Education Secretary.  Other notable appointments in a new-look top team include David Lammy as Shadow Justice Secretary, John Healey moved from housing to Shadow Defence Secretary, Jonathan Reynolds as Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary and Bridget Philipson as Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury.  Sir Keir had already announced that Anneliese Dodds would be Shadow Chancellor, with new deputy leader Angela Rayner becoming party chair.  Lisa Nandy, who came third in the Labour leadership race, is the new Shadow Foreign Secretary, while Nick Thomas-Symonds becomes Shadow Home Secretary.  Elsewhere Emily Thornberry becomes Shadow International Trade Secretary, while Andy McDonald, one of few allies of Jeremy Corbyn to survive, has been made Shadow Employment Rights and Protections Secretary.  Among those ousted were Ian Lavery, Barry Gardiner, Jon Trickett and Richard Burgon.

Mike Parson that state and federal agencies largely focus on repairing and strengthening levees will not do enough to protect communities from floods, environmentalists say.  Parson created the Flood Recovery Advisory Working Group last summer after record flooding along the state’s major rivers caused widespread damage to many Missouri communities. The group mostly consists of regulators, levee district representatives and members of agriculture associations.  There are no scientists and conservationists to acknowledge that climate change will worsen floods and promote long-term solutions to prevent flood damage, said Maisah Khan, water policy director at the Missouri Coalition for the Environment.  “Yes, we need to fix the levees, we need to get these folks out of this bad situation right now. We need to do the recovery piece, but we need to be focused on resiliency just as much,” Khan said. “It should be 50-50. With this set of recommendations, it’s like 90-10.”  The Missouri Coalition for the Environment and other environmental groups have repeatedly argued that levees will fail eventually. Restoring wetlands and other tactics that allow rivers to flow freely would do more to protect Missouri communities from floods, Khan said.  A few parts of the report recommended using alternative flood-control strategies, such as buying frequently flooded properties. It also recommended supporting efforts in Atchison County to move levees away from the Missouri River.  However, the report still encourages a pattern of building up levees that constrict rivers and asking for government aid when floods destroy property, said Bob Criss, a retired Washington University geology professor.  “All this document is, is trying to focus funding and authority to the ag interests. The people who caused the problem are demanding more funds from the rest of us,” Criss said.  The advisory group also presented some misleading information about flooding in its report, he added.  “They even claimed, incredibly, that urban flood problems aren’t as bad as rural flooding, which is just preposterous,” Criss said. “We have enormous flash-flood problems in all of our urban areas.”  The advisory group plans to produce a final version of its recommendations by late May. Khan wants to see the group provide opportunities for the general public to give feedback on the report and more information on how they suggest putting the recommendations into action.  “I think a lot of these recommendations are pretty vague and broad. The devil is going to be in the details on how they are implemented,” she said.

The utilities board, which also announced it had waived a hearing on the matter, made its move over the objections of environmental organizations and other civic groups opposed to DAPL operator Energy Transfer’s expansion plans.  Iowa’s approval landed just two days after a federal judge in North Dakota found that the project must undergo a full environmental review in a March 25 order, throwing the pipeline’s legal status into question. U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg, who issued that order, also asked attorneys involved in that dispute to submit briefs on whether DAPL should be shut down while the pipeline undergoes its environmental review.  The DAPL expansion, meanwhile, still needs approval from Illinois state regulators, and environmental groups have asked the Illinois Commerce Commission to hold off from making any decisions for the time being, citing not only Judge Boasberg’s ruling but also the turmoil in the global oil market and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on oil demand.  DAPL expansion plans previously were approved by state regulators in North Dakota and South Dakota, leaving only the Illinois permit left unobtained. A ruling from the Illinois Commerce Commission is expected this month, likely between April 7 and 16, according to those closely following the matter.  That means the DAPL project now sits at a point of enormous uncertainty — it could wind up, despite its lack of environmental review, allowed to carry twice as much oil a day as it has over the past three years or it could wind up without the legal authority to carry any oil at all.  In other words, for DAPL — the focus of years of grassroots organizing, legal battles, and protests worldwide — this could be a double or nothing moment.  From March 11, when COVID-19 was officially recognized by the World Health Organization as a pandemic, to today, with global confirmed COVID-19 cases well over 1 million, developments in the oil and gas pipeline industry have nonetheless marched onwards.  Below, you’ll find more important pipeline stories from across the U.S. from the past few weeks that may have escaped the national spotlight — many related to COVID-19 and others not — for readers who seek to catch up on some of what’s transpired during that time.   East Coast  In North Brooklyn, New York City, a National Grid pipeline — the 30-inch diameter Metropolitan Reliability Infrastructure Project planned to carry gas from Long Island and Massachusetts — had drawn community opposition and protests before the pandemic set in, in part due to climate concerns and objections to its $185 million price tag for National Grid customers, and in part because construction had proved disruptive for neighborhood businesses. On March 24, the Brooklyn Eagle reported that a construction worker had tested positive for COVID-19 — but it wasn’t until two days later, on March 26, that National Grid stopped work on the project, after photos showed workers were not social distancing (National Grid denied that there had been positive cases at its construction site, Brooklyn Eagle added).  “We’re sheltering in our homes to protect our neighbors and the people that we love,” Kevin Lacherra, an area resident, told the Eagle. “And while we were doing that, buying food and medicine and checking in on the elderly people on our block, National Grid was working around the clock to keep up construction on this pipeline.”  In Pennsylvania, the troubled Mariner East project has also been at the heart of controversy after its builder, Energy Transfer, sought to continue construction following the state’s shut down of all “non-life sustaining” businesses. Though the order, by Governor Tom Wolf, lists pipeline construction among industries required to shut down, it allows companies to seek waivers. Energy Transfer sought and obtained waivers allowing it to continue construction at 15 sites across Pennsylvania, according to State Impact.  “The waivers were requested to ensure the continued safety, integrity, and stabilization of these construction sites,” a spokesperson told the NPR affiliate. Those opposed to Mariner East described concerns that the company would rush construction forward at sites covered by the 10-day waivers, citing Energy Transfer’s rocky record in the state. A Mariner East worker was recently charged with a felony for forging weld records and the project reportedly remains under an ongoing investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and others.  The approved waivers for Mariner East construction include plans for workers to utilize PPE. An export pipeline for plastics is NOT LIFE SUSTAINING.  You know what is, @GovernorTomWolf?

In a ruling dated March 30, a federal judge in the Middle District of Pennsylvania allowed claims of nuisance, invasion of privacy, trespass, malicious prosecution, and false arrest to move forward in a federal lawsuit alleging that Energy Transfer, Tiger Swan, and other defendants had sent a hired infiltrator to the plaintiff’s property and that the infiltrator then spread false allegations against pipeline opponents.  Further south, in Virginia, opponents of the $5.5 billion Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP) have urged against resumption of construction on that project, which had been slated to re-start construction this spring. “They're coming from states in many cases that have higher COVID-19 rates than we do, like Louisiana where a lot of pipeline workers come from,” said pipeline opponent Diana Christopulos told a local ABC News affiliate.  In late March, federal regulators pushed back the deadline for their review of MVP’s impacts on wildlife to April 27 and Kallanish Energy reports that construction cannot resume unless those biological permits and two other permits are granted. In the meantime, the Roanoke Times reports that Virginia’s environmental regulators have discovered erosion and sediment control problems persisted at the pipeline project — and that violations had begun soon after a $2.15 million consent decree over earlier erosion problems had expired. Erosion and sediment control problems have been at the center of investigations into other pipeline explosions in recent years.  Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court is still deliberating on a case centered on the $8 billion Atlantic Coast pipeline and whether it would illegally cross the Appalachian Trail on federal land in Virginia. A decision in that case is expected before the end of June, according to a March 19 Energy News Network report.   Gulf Coast  Along the Gulf Coast, four contract workers tested positive for COVID-19 at a Dow Chemical plant in Plaquemine, Louisiana, WAFB9 reported on March 25. The plant, categorized as an essential business, remained operating, though Dow told reporters it was screening for fevers at plant entrances. Similarly, a BASF plant where chemicals used in the Roundup pesticide are manufactured and the Denka Performance Elastomer plant, both in Louisiana, have also discovered that workers have tested positive for the virus, according to The Advocate.  Meanwhile, Shell dropped out of plans to build the Lake Charles liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in Calcasieu Parish — but Energy Transfer has announced that it remains committed to the project, albeit at a “reduced size,” The Advocate also reports. A January 2020 report by the Environmental Integrity Project had found that the Lake Charles project was expected to be the second-largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions among the slew of petrochemical and LNG export projects proposed in the U.S.  @Shell’s withdrawal from the Lake Charles LNG venture is a worrying sign for many projects planned for mid-2020s startup in the Gulf of Mexico. https://t.co/Co4x5cU1EO @EnergyTransfer #LNG #covid19 #Shell #oilandgasindustry — Petroleum Economist (@PetroleumEcon) April 2, 2020  In Texas, the one-two punch of an oil price war and the reduced demand for gasoline amid the pandemic have left drillers in the Permian Basin reeling. “Occidental, Chevron, Pioneer Natural Resources, Parsley, and other oil companies are sharply cutting operations in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the epicenter of the U.S. shale-oil production boom,” The New York Times reported on March 31. “Schlumberger and other large service companies are cutting and furloughing thousands of workers.”  But it’s not clear yet that oil flows have subsided, leaving pipeline companies stuck between drillers who don’t want to cut back and refiners that are overflowing with oil. “If producers do not cooperate and refiners are not buying, pipeline operators can apply force majeure clauses,” Anas Al-Hajji, an energy analyst, told the Houston Chronicle on March 29, referring to contract clauses that can sometimes offer businesses an out from deals in unforeseen circumstances.  Meanwhile, environmental advocacy group Earthworks warns that their field organizers have observed an increase in the number of flares that are left unlit and that are venting raw methane gas — a powerful contributor to climate change — into the atmosphere across the Permian Basin. Because the gases from unlit flares are invisible to the eye, a infrared camera or other specialized device is necessary to spot the emissions spewing from unlit flares. Earthworks thermographers report a 34 percent rise in unlit flares in 2020, adding that “we have documented flares that remain unlit for days, weeks, months — and even over a year.”  And today, Kinder Morgan, builder of the Permian Highway natural gas pipeline, announced that it was suspending construction on that pipeline following a spill of drilling mud that affected water wells in Blanco County, Texas. That spill first came to light when locals discovered their tap water was muddy and contaminated, according to the Sierra Club. “From the beginning, thousands of Texans and local governments have been concerned about the construction of this pipeline and its long-term impacts on the Texas Hill Country and local waterways and aquifers,” Sierra Club’s Roddy Hughes said in a statement about the spill. “The fact that this spill was not made public until residents spoke out about contamination in their drinking water makes it clear that Kinder Morgan can’t be trusted to build this pipeline safely.”  The oil industry, exempt from stay-at-home orders, seems to have contaminated drinking water while building the Permian Highway Pipeline in Texashttps://t.co/Oj2b6mEVGl — Jamie Henn (@jamieclimate) April 2, 2020   Central US  In contrast, TC Energy, the Canadian firm formerly known as TransCanada, is pushing forward with plans to build the Keystone XL pipeline project, which would carry 830,000 barrels a day of tar sands oil from Alberta into the United States. The Alberta government said it will be investing roughly $1.1 billion in the construction project and offering TC Energy $4.2 billion in loan guarantees. “We cannot wait for the end of the pandemic and the global recession to act,” Alberta Premier Jason Kenney told NPR. “There are steps we must make now to build our future focused on jobs, the economy, and pipelines.”  “Our rural communities are strained as it is for medical supplies and hospital beds amid a global pandemic,” countered Jane Kleeb, founder of Bold Nebraska. “TC Energy must put an end to any construction in our small towns as the pandemic grows across our country.”  GREAT news this week regarding the Keystone XL Pipeline – moving forward with fantastic paying CONSTRUCTION jobs for hardworking Americans. Promises Made, Promises Kept! #MAGA — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 3, 2020  Keystone XL, like many other oil and gas pipelines, will benefit from a designation as “critical infrastructure” in a growing number of states, 350’s Bill McKibben wrote April 2 for The New Yorker.  Since the pandemic was declared, three states — Kentucky, South Dakota, and West Virginia — have all signed “critical infrastructure bills into law,” according to EcoWatch. “While we are all paying attention to COVID-19 and the congressional stimulus packages, state legislatures are quietly passing fossil-fuel-backed anti-protest laws,” Greenpeace USA researcher Connor Gibson, told HuffPost. “These laws do nothing new to protect communities. Instead they seek to crack down on the sort of nonviolent civil disobedience that has shaped much of our nation's greatest political and social victories.”   West Coast  On the West Coast, Pembina's Jordan Cove project in Oregon obtained approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for an LNG terminal and associated pipeline project in mid-March. The project, however, still lacks state permits — and the move by FERC drew immediate objection from Oregon’s Governor Kate Brown.  “Given a national and state emergency, in which the federal government and its agencies are unable to fulfill their basic responsibility to keep citizens safe, it is stunning that the FERC moved forward on this decision today, approving the Jordan Cove project and Pacific Connector Gas Pipeline,” Gov.

Hilcorp had proposed to buy out $5.6 billion of BP’s Alaskan assets — but state regulators appear concerned about Hilcorp’s capacity to finance that deal.

Donald Trump is destroying our country and everything we care about. We need leaders who will solve climate change and COVID, not deny them. Leaders who will fight against systemic racism and inequality and that starts by voting for someone who understands how much is at stake, someone who’s building at team who shares our values. It starts with voting against Donald Trump and for Joe Biden. Silence is not an option and we cannot sit this one out. We all have to vote like our lives and the world depend on it, because they do. The only way to be certain of the future is to make it ourselves.

The danger is centered on New South Wales and Victoria, Australia's most populous states, where temperatures and wind speeds are escalating after a few days of relatively benign conditions.  The New South Wales Rural Fire Service has warned that coastal towns south of Sydney including Eden, Batemans Bay and Nowra could again be under threat weeks after losing homes to the fires.  'We want people out (and) into safer places,' Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told reporters.  In neighboring Victoria, evacuation orders were issued in alpine areas. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews pleaded with residents to evacuate fire-danger areas when alerts were issued.  \"If it is safe to get out, then you must get out. That is the only way to guarantee your safety,\" Andrews said on Thursday.  Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the Australian military was on standby to help firefighters and emergency agencies.  'I've given them very clear instructions that they are to stand ready to move and support immediately,' Morrison said on Friday. 'In the event that they are needed in the wake of what we hope we will not see today, but we must prepare for today.'  The military has already been involved in the unfolding crisis by clearing roads closed by fallen trees, burying dead cattle and sheep and providing fodder to surviving livestock.  Temperatures in the threatened area were expected to reach into the mid-40s Celsius (more than 110 degrees Fahrenheit) on Friday, and conditions remained tinder dry.  The unprecedented fire crisis in southeast Australia that has claimed at least 26 lives, destroyed more than 2,000 homes and scorched an area twice the size of the U.S. state of Maryland since September has focused many Australians on how the nation adapts to climate change. Morrison has come under blistering criticism for downplaying the need for his government to address climate change, which experts say helps supercharge the blazes.  Asked whether he expected fire emergencies of the same magnitude to become more common in the future with climate change, Morrison did not give a direct answer.  'There'll be the reviews that take place as you'd expect and I've indicated in response to questions that we'll be working closely with state and territory authorities on how they're undertaken,' Morrison told reporters. 'The links and implications here have been acknowledged.'  Morrison brushed off criticism over what many Australians perceive as a slow, detached response to the wildfire crisis.  'What we've got here is the single largest federal response to a bushfire disaster nationally that the country has ever seen,' Morrison said. 'The government's responding to an unprecedented crisis with an unprecedented level of support.'  Doug Schutz, who began volunteering with the Rural Fire Service some 53 years ago, at the age of 13, said the current danger seemed different to wildfires in the past.  'I've lived here all my life, and seen a lot of fires. And this one just doesn't want to do what it's supposed to do,' the captain of Tomerong brigade south of Sydney said. 'This fire has its own agenda. In some ways, I nearly think it's got a brain.

After the success of that film, Silverstone endured an iteration of what was not yet called body shaming when she played Batgirl and shrank back somewhat from public life. “I just loved acting,” she said. “I never expected to be famous. I didn’t know what it meant.”  At 21, she began pursuing another interest: veganism, which she had tried off and on since she was eight years old. She has written a bestselling cookbook, “The Kind Diet,” and been frequently interviewed, including by The New York Times, about her “green” beauty routine.  The sideline, though, came with some side-eye. She faced criticism for putting her son, Bear Blu, on a vegan diet and “bird-feeding” him. (Although vegan diets are controversial for children, this is not settled in the medical community. A spokesperson for Silverstone wrote in an email that he “chooses to eat vegan.”) And again when she wrote in her second book, “The Kind Mama,” a diet- and lifestyle-based parenting guide, that her son, who was a baby at the time, had “never had a drop of medicine.” Silverstone — like other celebrities, including Jessica Biel and Jenny McCarthy — has made anti-immunization statements. (“She uses critical thinking when it comes to medical decisions and feels it’s important to make informed decisions,” her representative wrote.)  “People said lots of different things, and I was sort of ‘the freak,’ and I guess I’ll take pride in that because it is hard to be the person that’s speaking out, and it is hard to be the person that is saying the thing that isn’t what everybody else wants to hear,” she said.  Experts agree that you should give your children medicine when needed. Anti-vaccine sentiment, which dates back to at least the 1970s, has gotten louder in recent years. Vaccines prevent diseases, and people who don’t vaccinate their children put everyone at risk.  At 31, Silverstone found an agent who encouraged her to only take on projects that she loved. She had married Christopher Jarecki in 2005 (they divorced in 2018), and their son was born in 2011. She took on a few projects a year, some lower profile, as well as “Vamps,” another movie directed by Amy Heckerling, the writer-director of “Clueless.”  “I feel like I’m just following my bliss with work going wherever it feels interesting and wherever I get to do something fun,” Silverstone said.  In 2017, she took on supporting roles in films like Yorgos Lanthimos’s psychological thriller, “The Killing of a Sacred Deer”; “The Lodge,” a horror film; “Book Club,” a senior rom-com; and in the short-lived TV comedy series “American Woman.”  Most recently, she portrayed a struggling real estate agent who convinces herself she and her husband need couples therapy in the dark comedy “Bad Therapy,” which was released in mid-April.  In May, she starred in the musical remake of the 1983 teen rom-com “Valley Girl,” as the adult version of the titular character, and this July, she’ll have a supporting role in Netflix’s family-friendly series “The Babysitter’s Club,” as the mother of one of the entrepreneurial young girls, Kristy Thomas.   ‘Everything back to diet’  Silverstone committed to veganism out of her love for animals, particularly her dog, Sampson, a rescue Rottweiler mix. “I realized that when I was petting his leg, that leg felt the same as the sort of chicken breasts I might be eating, or whatever animal I was eating,” she said. “And I started to wonder what my leg might taste like if somebody ate it.”  Formerly associated with hippies and animal-rights protests, the vegan diet has become more mainstream thanks to concerns about climate change and the wellness movement.  Silverstone said eating vegan cleared up her acne, helped her lose weight and ditch her asthma inhaler and gave more energy than ever before. It felt like “great karma” to her. It also presented her with a business opportunity.  Besides the books, she founded, with Garden of Life, Mykind Organics, a line of organic, non-GMO vitamins.  “I’ve had these amazing experiences where people on the street say, ‘I had lupus, I suffer from MS, I have chronic migraines,’” she said. “Or even, ‘I had a really bad heart, I was on heart medication.’ Or ‘I had thyroid medication.’ All these things that people, then, with their doctor, end up not needing anymore because they changed their diets.”  Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...  From her Los Angeles home, Silverstone has been promoting the GoFundMe project Frontline Responders Fund on Instagram to help get personal protective equipment to those in need and making donations to designer Christian Siriano, a friend, who has turned his own space into a massive factory.  Every time Silverstone asks Siriano for masks on behalf of her nurse friends and their hospitals, he adds them to the list and delivers. “It’s really good to see how much people are all coming together on this,” she said.  She has also been mourning her friend, Mark Blum, the actor whom she worked with on the film “Sister of the Groom.” He died of COVID-19 at 69 in March. “It’s a really sad, scary time for so many people,” she said.  Her daily routine involves sensible self-nourishment. “I always bring everything back to diet,” she said. “When I don’t eat well, I don’t feel well, and then my moods go all over the place.” Silverstone has been eating meals filled with fresh herbs, greens, miso soup and ginger tea. She has found comfort in cooking, of course, but also in daily long walks, yoga, writing in a journal and meditation.  She has also been focused on finding activities to do with Bear Blu, now nine years old, when he’s not with Jarecki — like bouncing on the mini trampoline, dancing or jump roping. “My son and I take baths together, and when he’s not with me, I take a bath and that really feels nourishing and comforting,” Silverstone said.   A quarter-century since ‘Clueless’  She is still amazed by the “brilliant genius” of Heckerling. “It’s generational,” Silverstone said. “The people that were watching it when it came out have shared it with their children, and so it just keeps going and keeps living. I don’t know why that happens to some movies and others it doesn’t, but I’m so grateful to be a part of it.”  In 2017, she introduced a screening of the film at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery and took her son to see the movie for the first time. “I didn’t want to miss out on this opportunity to show him the movie on the big screen like that with 4,000 people outside,” she said. “It just felt like a moment.”  For her, what’s most memorable about the film are the costumes that make “entrances.” After filming, she even kept some of her favourite items, like Cher’s Mary Janes, but she’s since given all of the items away. Back then, Silverstone said, she had “no style” and wore the same green T-shirt and jeans every day for four years.  When asked which actor should play Cher in a reboot, Silverstone laughed. She’s far removed from the film that once made her a star: “I’m like a grandma at my house who’s going to help climate change and raise my son.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 19, "positive": 20, "negative": 4, "sadness": 1, "joy": 13, "anger": 10, "surprise": 1, "fear": 5, "trust": 4}, "metadata": ["teenager", "children", "horror", "mainstream", "climate", "los", "frontline", "donations", "adds", "journal", "focused"]}, {"text": " Pay based on use   Get Started  Purchase a Team or Enterprise subscription for per week  You will be billed per month after the trial ends  ", "emotions": {"trust": 1, "anticipation": 1}, "metadata": []}, {"text": "From his rejection of multilateralism to his embrace of hostile dictators, President Trump’s foreign policy has failed all but a small clique of committed war hawks, defense contractors, and international corporations. As Joe Biden and Kamala Harris work to present a stark contrast to Trump on the home front, it is important that he draw no less clear a distinction when it comes to U.S. policy abroad.  Practically speaking, this would mean embracing international cooperation to manage ongoing crises including human rights violations, climate change, corporate concentration, and economic inequality, and eschewing military action as a primary avenue of conflict resolution. It would also mean adopting equitable trade deals that benefit American workers and fight climate change. However, proposals alone are not sufficient and must be paired with a commitment to appointing personnel dedicated to realizing a progressive foreign-policy vision.  Rather than turning to neoliberal veterans of the Clinton and Obama administrations who have bounced between government positions and the private sector, Biden should appoint those with a proven track record of effectively advancing the public interest. Particularly, a Biden administration must take the following steps:  Appoint Pro-Labor, Pro-Climate Trade Officials  Recent U.S. trade deals have contributed to a marked redistribution of wealth upward at the expense of labor and environmental protections. Given these outcomes, it is perhaps unsurprising that previous U.S. trade representatives charged with negotiating these deals have consistently had deep ties to industry. President Trump’s chief trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, served as deputy U.S. trade representative under Ronald Reagan before a 30-year spell leading Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP’s international trade group. Obama’s trade representative Michael Froman, who negotiated harmful deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (which never passed), joined the administration after holding several leadership roles at Citigroup, a reckless firm that required incomprehensibly large federal bailouts to survive. Froman is now vice chairman and president of strategic growth for Mastercard.  A progressive vision of trade will have to rethink the current structure of patent and copyright protections that prioritize corporate interests over social and economic justice. Reining in corporate capture of trade deals would also mean eliminating the anti-democratic investor-state dispute settlement provisions that limit countries’ capacities to regulate entities in the interests of their citizens. Equally important are clear and actionable provisions that adequately protect workers and the environment. Finally, tech companies’ rapidly growing power on the global stage signals the need for a fair international system to regulate the digital economy.  Biden must appoint officials who can push such a vision forward. Unfortunately, several corporate globalists from past administrations are already attempting to influence Biden’s trade platform. One is Jennifer Hillman, a former trade official under Clinton and Bush who helped push the notorious anti-labor deal NAFTA. After leaving the White House, Hillman served on the WTO’s appellate body, where her views on trade were so controversial that Obama blocked her reappointment.  Another example is former State Department economist Heidi Crebo-Rediker, who joined the Obama White House after two decades as an investment banker working for notorious banks including Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. Crebo-Rediker has since exploited her White House connections to advise financial institutions on trade policy.  Perhaps most troubling of all Biden’s current advisers is Steve Ricchetti. As a former aide to President Clinton, Ricchetti was instrumental in passing NAFTA and opening up trade relations with China, leading to a decline in U.S. manufacturing jobs. After leaving the White House, Ricchetti went on to lobby on behalf of pharmaceutical companies and financial institutions before returning to Biden’s side for his presidential run.  In order to truly enact a progressive trade agenda, Biden must end industry’s influence on U.S. foreign policy and commit to appointing trade officials who will serve the public interest, not their former employers and clients. So far, he has shown no indication he will break from his pro-corporate predecessors.  Seal the Revolving Door Between the Defense Industry and the Pentagon  The revolving door between the Department of Defense and the arms industry has helped pave the way for excessive militarism and corporate enrichment. William Lynn, Obama’s first deputy secretary of defense, was a lobbyist for Raytheon before his appointment. Subsequent Pentagon chief Ashton Carter, also came in by way of Raytheon. Before serving as President George W. Bush’s secretary of defense, Gordon England was president of General Dynamics.  The defense industry’s stranglehold on the Pentagon has only tightened under Trump. A report from the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) found that the top 20 defense contractors hired 645 former senior government officials, legislative staff, and legislators in 2018. All of Donald Trump’s acting and permanent secretaries of defense have come from the industry, from mainstream media favorite James Mattis (General Dynamics) to his acting replacement Patrick Shanahan (Boeing) to current chief Mark Esper (Raytheon’s top lobbyist).  The defense industry’s influence on national-security policy has led to a consistent, reckless prioritization of military action over diplomacy, including the United States’ military involvement in Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Afghanistan, and Libya, and its continued support of Saudi Arabia’s bombing of Yemeni civilians. Bloated defense spending sails through Congress while investments in health care, infrastructure, medical research, education, and housing struggle to get traction.  A future Biden administration has the ability to pursue a progressive national-security agenda: prioritizing diplomacy over military action, reducing the Pentagon’s budget, opposing regime-change interventions, supporting refugees, and condemning governments that violate human rights. But the Biden camp must first end the military-industrial complex’s influence in the executive branch.  So far, the Biden campaign has instilled little hope on this front. The campaign’s six “unity task forces” made up of experts from both the Biden and Sanders camps, did not include a task force on foreign policy. Instead, Biden has been receiving advice from a cast of conflicted advisers, including Michèle Flournoy, Anthony Blinken, and Avril Haines, all of whom began working for the defense industry after leaving the Obama administration.  Pursue an Aggressive International Agenda to Address Climate Change  The climate crisis is a fundamental threat to the world, particularly in communities of color and low-income communities, and requires international cooperation. Unfortunately, the Trump administration has undone many of the positive steps taken by the Obama administration, leaving the Paris Agreement, repealing the Clean Power Plan, and scaling back numerous environmental protections.  Trump’s catastrophic climate policy can be credited to his top EPA appointments, both of whom have spent most of their professional life attacking environmental regulations. Scott Pruitt, a climate change denialist, sued the EPA over ten times as attorney general of Oklahoma, and his election campaigns were sponsored by fossil fuel industry executives. Similarly, Andrew Wheeler joined Trump’s EPA after numerous years as a registered lobbyist for Murray Energy, one of the country’s largest private coal companies. With these individuals at the helm, the Trump administration has pushed for reversal of 100 environmental rules, successfully completing 68 of these proposed rollbacks.  Breaking with his predecessors, Joe Biden has proposed a hugely ambitious climate plan that will invest $2 trillion in his first term on clean-energy initiatives, including transitioning the country’s energy grid to run on 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2035. Although he has not proposed a nationwide ban on fracking or a phaseout of fossil fuels, various climate groups have praised the campaign’s more progressive direction.  But we cannot tackle climate change on our own; it must also play a central role in our foreign-policy agenda. That begins with rejoining the Paris climate agreement. Our trade officials should refuse to join any trade agreements that prop up the fossil fuel industry. In addition, a Biden administration must proactively work with allies to develop and integrate green-energy technology and infrastructure globally.  Beyond trade and diplomacy, our national-security decisions must center climate change, the effects of which have already caused global instability, destruction, and death across the globe. Biden should not leave the protection of the environment to the EPA alone. All foreign-policy appointees, including secretary of state, U.S. trade representative, undersecretary of the Treasury for international affairs, deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs, and U.N. ambassador, must prioritize climate change in all policy decisions.  Without a foreign-policy task force, it’s not clear who would be appointed to these top positions. Biden’s climate advisers include multiple board members of fossil fuel companies and the director of a fossil fuel industry–funded think tank.  For far too long, foreign-policy decisions in both Republican and Democratic administrations have been controlled by the wealthy and well-connected. A Biden administration has the opportunity to break this cycle. To do so, he must stop empowering individuals who serve the interests of corporations over those of the public. Instead, Biden should appoint individuals who will recommit to multilateralism, reject trade deals that only benefit corporate interests, ensure climate and labor interests are represented in trade negotiations and decisions, commit to reducing defense spending, and prioritize diplomacy over military intervention.

Bad weather forced the team charged with measuring the mountain's current height to return to base camp, but they have since taken up their former position, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.  As long as the weather holds, the team expects to reach the summit on Friday morning, Xinhua quoted Wang Yongfeng, deputy director of the mountaineering administrative center of the General Administration of Sport, as saying.  Everest straddles the border of China and Nepal and both countries canceled spring climbing to prevent the coronavirus from spreading among expedition teams that typically live for weeks in tightly packed camps at high altitudes with little access to emergency medical help.  China's network of Beidou satellites, a rival to America's Global Positioning System, is being used to survey the mountain's current height and natural resources. Data on snow depth, weather and wind speed is also being measured to monitor the deterioration of glaciers and other ecological impacts of climate change.  China has conducted six major surveys of the mountain locally known as Qomolangma, registering its height at 8,848.13 meters (29,029 feet) in 1975 and 8,844.43 meters (29,017 feet) in 2005.  China has also taken advantage of the lack of climbers to collect garbage from Everest and other popular climbing peaks.  Last year, too many climbers formed long lines at the summit and some died from lack of oxygen. A total of 876 people climbed the peak in 2019, according to the Himalayan Database.  The absence of climbers this year has caused major hardship among Sherpa guides in Nepal, who have virtually no source of income apart from foreign tourists visiting national parks and high-altitude trekking routes.

In Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, the first three states to weigh in, voters have elevated the candidate promising the biggest departure from the politics of the past \" not necessarily the clearest path to defeating President Donald Trump or a restoration of the Obama era. After fighting to a draw in Iowa, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who bills himself as the leader of a revolution, bested candidates in New Hampshire and Nevada promising a restoration of the pre-Trump era and those who focus mainly on their electability.  To be sure, the results reflect the choices of a narrow slice of Democratic voters, a group well to the left of the electorate that will decide the presidency in November. Meanwhile, Sanders has no doubt benefited from a crowded contest where moderates are splitting their support, preventing a single candidate from emerging as the top centrist alternative.  But Sanders' commanding win in Nevada's caucuses last Saturday \" he trounced all of his rivals \" suggests the fractured race isn't the moderates' only problem: The senator's promise to upend the American political system is resonating beyond liberals, and the desire for fundamental change is coming from even moderate and conservative Democrats.  More analysts attribute this to an increasing polarization in politics.  'After four years of Donald Trump, the American people are hungry for change,\" said Democratic strategist Rebecca Katz. 'The Democratic electorate is split on the best way and the best person to get it done.'  In Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to weigh in, nearly two-thirds of all Democratic voters said they wanted a candidate who will bring drastic change to Washington, rather than restore the pre-Trump era, according to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of thousands of voters in both states. That included about 60% of Democrats in either state who identified as moderate or conservative.  That 'big change' coalition is clear in national surveys, too. In October, a majority of voters planning to vote in a Democratic primary said they'd prefer a candidate who would take a new and different approach to one who would build on former President Barack Obama's legacy, according to a poll from NBC News/Wall Street Journal.  'If the country had been the way that it needed to be in the first place, Trump never would've gotten elected,' said Linda Jones, a 50-year-old coordinator for teachers' union and an enthusiastic Sanders backer in Nevada.  She added, 'There's no point trying to put it in the pre-Trump era. You need to make fundamental changes. Trump didn't cause climate change.'  Jones' view has been a headwind for former Vice President Joe Biden, the candidate unabashedly running on a promise to return to an earlier era. Asked Sunday why he was running, Biden said he wanted to 'restore some dignity to the office.\"  There's no doubt voters are trying to reconcile their desire for drastic change with the hunger to beat Trump. Majorities in Iowa and New Hampshire agreed a candidate with strongly liberal views would have difficulty against Trump in November, according to AP VoteCast surveys.  In Iowa and New Hampshire, that message won over some Democrats who say they would rather go back to a pre-Trump era instead of seeking structural change. But those voters divided their support among multiple candidates in those states, including Biden, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.  In Nevada, Klobuchar's support plummeted, while Biden's distant second-place finish was his best yet. Former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, another candidate running on electability and stabilizing, rather than transforming Washington, did not compete in those states.  The voters itching for change in many ways line up with Sanders' coalition. In Iowa and New Hampshire, more than 80% of voters under age 30 wanted a candidate who would transform Washington. About half of young voters in both states backed 78-year-old Sanders.  But AP VoteCast surveys in the first two states suggest Sanders isn't the only beneficiary of the hunger for something new. Buttigieg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren both performed well with voters seeking dramatic change, presumably for different reasons.  While some voters are focused on enacting new, big policies \" universal health care or major new wealth taxes such as those championed by Sanders and Warren. Others see change as a matter of passing the leadership baton to a younger generation \" Buttigieg is 38 \" and want to move past old partisan battles.  'I don't want to keep seeing us go back and forth between Democrat-Republican, Democrat-Republican,' said Veronica Gerhard, a 30-year-old Buttigieg supporter. Gerhard would like to see big changes in the country, but not at the revolutionary pace Sanders wants them to come. She worries that sort of upheaval would only lead to the pendulum swinging back in favor of another president like Trump.  'I want us to pave a path where we can start to work together and start to actually make a change in that sense, have Republicans and Democrats unite.'

The west Texas Mr. Trump left behind bears little resemblance to the region as it was when he first took office in January 2017, as the shale rush resumed following 2016’s oil price plunge.  Today, the shale boom of the 2010’s is officially bust, battered not only by the US’s outsized failure to control COVID-19 outbreaks and an oil price war in which foreign producers proved their ability to steer oil prices, but also a wave of multi-billion dollar write-downs by oil giants — write-downs that predated both the price war and the pandemic and resulted from the industry’s perpetual struggles to generate profits from shale drilling and fracking regardless of the price of oil.  Last Friday, just 103 active drilling rigs dotted Texas, according to data from Baker Hughes. That’s down from 403 drilling rigs as 2020 began and the state’s peak this decade of 930. Just 251 active oil and gas rigs could be found across the entire United States, the lowest number recorded since Baker Hughes began tracking the rig count back in 1940.  In late February, the nighttime horizons around Midland and Odessa were still dotted with brightly burning oil well flares, dozens of flickering licks of flame that cast an uncertain light across the mesquite and cotton fields of west Texas. Mancamps and hotels already appeared partially emptied out, even while a constant flow of truck traffic streamed along the desert highways.  Empty worker housing at FTSI in Odessa, Texas.

Instead of flares, the Permian basin’s emptied highways were lined with abandoned work boots and gloves, hung up on barbed wire fence post in an oilfield memorial for jobs lost to layoffs and bankruptcies.

But this year’s collapse, according to industry insiders, has the potential to forever break that cycle — not because the boom days are here to stay, but because it’s possible that oil may never make a full comeback.  “I believe it is likely to assume that demand will take a long time to recover,” Shell CEO Ben van Beurden said today as he announced his company’s second quarter loss, an unprecedented $18.38 billion, “if it recovers at all.”  'We Have All Destroyed Capital'  In April, Scott Sheffield, the chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, testified before the Texas Railroad Commission (which serves as the state’s oil regulator) that the shale rush had been “an economic disaster.”  “Nobody wants to give us capital because we have all destroyed capital and created economic waste,” Sheffield testified, warning that without state intervention, “we will disappear as an industry, like the coal industry.”  Indeed, before the pandemic struck, the shale industry’s financial foundations were stunningly shaky, with experts questioning the ways companies calculated their reserves, their ability to generate free cash flow from their drilling operations, and ratings agencies grading shale debts at junk levels. The entire fossil fuel industry’s long-term future is also deeply uncertain, as the impacts of climate change become increasingly visceral and the global need to cut emissions from oil and gas more urgent.

Credit: ©2020 Justin Hamel  It’s not at all clear what the COVID-19 pandemic will mean for energy use or greenhouse gas pollution worldwide. Before the pandemic, the oil and gas industry worldwide was just beginning to face real competition from cheaper non-fossil fuel-based energy sources, and renewable energy groups are now working hard to promote their inclusion in recovery plans.  While most of the decline in driving due to shelter-in-place orders is expected to be temporary, an analysis this month by KPMG International predicts a 10 percent permanent reduction in US miles driven per year. More people worldwide are also buying and driving electric vehicles. “The shift towards sustainability is the driving force behind the electrification of transport,” Ram Chandrasekaran, a Wood Mackenzie analyst said in an April statement. “Uncertainty caused by the oil price war and global catastrophes will only serve to strengthen that resolve, not deter it.”   Ups and Downs  To be sure, Texas has seen oil busts before.  “The fabled [early] eighties collapse—a 60 percent drop over sixteen months, from 4,530 rigs to 1,807—was the most dramatic in rig-count history,” Texas Monthly reported in 1986, amid yet another historic oil price plunge. “But it was not the largest. The record, set in 1971, is a decline of 74 percent after a fifteen-year slide to 814 rigs.”  But this year’s collapse has been extraordinary, both before and after the pandemic. It took just one year, from last July to this month, to replicate that 74 percent slide. Today, Shell announced a $16.8 billion impairment charge for the second quarter of 2020.  A less wild future for the oil industry has been predicted countless times before.  “Oil’s Boom-and-Bust Cycle May Be Over,” a Harvard Business Review headline proclaimed just two and a half years ago. The authors credited shale drillers with ensuring that oil prices would stay relatively steady. “Unlike national oil companies and oil majors that typically take five to 10 years to develop conventional oil reserves,” four partners at management consulting firm Oliver Wyman wrote, “these independent and ‘unconventional’ players have improved their drilling and fracturing technology to the point where they can respond within months to temporary spikes or dips in the market.”  That proved to be an ill-fated prediction. In the two and a half years since, the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate oil has hit highs over $75 a barrel and plunged to negative $37 — a stunning and unprecedented drop below zero dollars a barrel.

Industries, a Permian trucking and chemical services firm, told The New York Times.  More than 200 North American oil explorers have gone belly up since 2015, leaving behind over $130 billion in debt. “Profitability and shareholder returns have been consistently disappointing, and investors had already grown wary of throwing more money into shale before this year’s oil crash,” Bloomberg reported in a June profile of bankrupt shale drillers.  Industry insiders say Texas oil production may never return to shale boom levels. “I don’t think I’ll see 13 million [barrels a day] again in my lifetime,” Matt Gallagher, the 37 year-old CEO of Parsley Energy, a major Permian driller that reported a $3.7 billion loss in the first quarter of 2020, told the Financial Times two weeks ago.  Some within OPEC have also begun warning that the oil market shocks could permanently change oil consumption patterns worldwide (though OPEC has also predicted a rapid bounce-back for the industry). “The main concern is that oil demand will peak in the next few years due to rapid technological advances, especially in car batteries,” an oil ministry official of a “major OPEC member,” told Reuters this week.  “This is permanent demand destruction,” a second former OPEC official added.   Invisible Pollution  The plunge in drilling, however, may not directly lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas pollution in the Texas oil fields. Environmental groups fear that drillers under financial pressure may seek to cut corners on pollution controls— creating significant long-term costs for the rest of us.  One of the most acute hazards in the oilfields of Texas is hydrogen sulfide gas — a deadly and invisible fog that can seep from bacteria-contaminated wells.

Credit: ©2020 Justin Hamel  “There are fewer federal worker safety inspectors than in the last two administrations, and state oil inspectors appear to give only superficial scrutiny to the sites, according to public records,” a major E&E News investigation this month found. “Between 2015 and 2019, the commission recorded 126,000 inspections statewide at sites with hydrogen sulfide permits. But in 96% of the inspections the inspectors simply verified whether warning signs and fences were in place, according to an E&E News analysis of state inspection data.”  The oilfields around Midland and Odessa now leak so much hydrogen sulfide gas that state air monitoring surveys found levels up to five times the legal limits during testing inside populated areas (though dramatically less H2S was present than can be found in the oil fields, where H2S levels can reach and exceed concentrations that kill people within minutes).  Flaring — or the burning off of natural gas right as it flows from an oil well — has also been a major problem in the Permian.  Sharon Wilson, an organizer with Earthworks, an environmental watchdog which tracks flaring, told DeSmog in early March that she’d been discovering an increasing number of unlit flares in the Permian, their emissions only visible via a specialized FLIR camera. Those unlit flares, sometimes called vents, spewed raw methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and volatile organic compounds like benzene directly into the atmosphere. In the first few months of 2020, she’d documented 61 sites where venting and flaring was underway, finding that 34 percent of the flares she encountered were unlit, up from 14 percent in 2017.  Recent research, based on satellite data and evidence from trace gases, corroborates concerns that venting and flaring are under-reported in Texas.  “In total, the volumes reported in the state database were only around half of what the satellite observed,” researcher Gunna W. Schade wrote in an article published today by the science news service Phys.org, adding that S&P Global also reported similar inconsistencies in New Mexico and North Dakota.  “These large differences may be explained by reporting errors and by several flare operations that are simply exempted from volume reporting,” Schade wrote. “But we suspect that there is an even more systemic, mundane explanation: venting—the direct release of raw gas to the atmosphere.”  'We’re Okay Now. We’re Back. We’re Back.'  On Wednesday, during his campaign fundraiser in the Permian, Mr. Trump listed ways that his administration had tried to bolster the oil and gas business.  “Under the last administration, America’s energy industry was under relentless and unceasing attack,” he said. “But the day I took the Oath of Office, we ended the war on American energy and we stopped the far-left assault on American energy workers.”  “I withdrew from the one-sided, energy-destroying Paris Climate Accord,” he said. “We cancelled the Obama administration’s job-crushing Clean Power Plan. You know all about that. I approved the Keystone XL and the Dakota Access pipelines immediately upon assuming office.”  Mr. Trump told those gathered inside a white tent that over $1 billion in pandemic aid had flowed to the Texas energy industry’s workers. “Through the Paycheck Protection Program, we provided over $1 billion in emergency aid to keep Texas energy workers on the payroll,” he said. “We kept them all on the payroll.”  Oilfield services shop. Odessa, Texas. May 28, 2020. Credit: ©2020 Justin Hamel  Later, he told the crowd that in April, he’d struck a deal with Saudi Arabia, Russia, and other countries to cut their oil production and “got” them to “cut nearly 10 million barrels a day.”  “And I want to thank, frankly, Saudi Arabia. I want to thank Russia. I want to thank Mexico,” he said, adding that he wanted to thank OPEC+, in a speech the White House called “Remarks by President Trump on Restoring Energy Dominance in the Permian Basin.”  It’s not clear how much fruit all of the administration’s efforts to breathe life into the shale industry have borne.  Today, Bloomberg reported that OPEC+ is “days away from unleashing crude back onto the market following historic output cuts,” listing that as one reason oil prices today dipped back below $40 a barrel (another was Mr. Trump’s tweet signaling his support for delaying national elections in November).  Over 100,000 oil and gas jobs had been lost nationwide as of June, an analysis of federal data by Rystad Energy found. Last week the Houston Chronicle tallied 446 more lost jobs, warning of another 537 in danger due to their employers' bankruptcies.  The oil industry's struggles pale in comparison to the broader economy's job losses, with the Commerce Department reporting today that the nation's gross domestic product fell 9.5% in the second quarter and the Labor Department reporting the country's 19th straight week of more than 1 million unemployment claim filings.  The impacts on Texas, which has also struggled to contain the virus, have been profound. The West Texas Food Bank has been distributing nearly 900,000 pounds of food each month since March, almost double what it gave out last year, the Wall Street Journal reported this month, adding that three quarters of the recipients were there for the very first time.  Those difficulties didn’t seem to touch Mr. Trump during his talk on Wednesday.  “We’re okay now,” Mr. Trump told the gathered oil industry representatives. “We’re back. We’re back.”  Main image: Laid off workers boots hung on fence posts after their last shift in the oil fields. Eddy County, New Mexico. May 27, 2020.

In 2011, University of Maryland psychologist Michele Gelfand conducted a 33-nation study of the differences between “tight” and “loose” cultures. For the purpose of this research, Gelfand defined cultural tightness as “the strength of a society’s norms and the strictness of its punishments for deviant behavior.” Loose cultures are more permissive.  In a new series of studies published in the journal PLOS ONE, Gelfand and her colleagues drew on the insights from that first study to analyze the relationship between cultural tightness, ecological threats, and prejudice against perceived outsiders.  The first study related the findings on tightness and looseness to results from the World Values Survey, which asked participants whether or not they were willing to live near people from a different race or religion, immigrants, people who spoke a different language, people of a different sexual orientation, or unmarried cohabitants. The researchers found that tightness “robustly predicted prejudice across nations.” Countries with relatively open cultures, like the Netherlands, Australia, and the United States, tended to score lower on prejudice than countries with the highest cultural tightness, like Malaysia and Turkey. (There were some outliers, like Pakistan, with high cultural tightness and relatively low prejudice).  The researchers replicated this study design with U.S. states, finding a similar relationship between cultural tightness and prejudice. States like Arkansas and Mississippi, with the tightest cultures, ranked highest on the scale of prejudice; states like Alaska, Hawaii, and Maine, with more loose cultures, ranked near the bottom in prejudice.  But culture does not exist in a bubble, and it isn’t fixed, either. Culture is formed by social and economic forces, and it tends to change over time. “When cultures of any size face existential threats, like storms, flooding, scarcity . . . not just climatic threats but including the kind of climatic threats that might come with something like climate change, they often tighten,” says Joshua Conrad Jackson, a cultural psychologist at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and one of the study’s authors. In the next stage of their study, Jackson, Gelfand, and their colleagues tested this idea, by investigating whether ecological threats could push societies to tighten up.  Sometimes this new conformity can be positive, Jackson notes. In emergency situations like during a hurricane, you may want your society to obey directives like submitting to an evacuation order or respecting a curfew.  “What we looked at in this paper was the darker side of that dynamic,” he says. “And so, when cultures tighten, when norms and rules get stricter, people tend to orient to existing traditions and they become less trusting of people who are different. The outcome of all this is more prejudice, more discrimination against people who are minorities.”  Across a range of studies, looking at both current-day nations, U.S. federal states, and non-industrial societies, Jackson and his team concluded that “ecological threats such as pathogens, warfare, and resource scarcity predicted greater cultural tightness, and people in tighter cultures were more prejudiced against racial, national, sexual, and religious minorities.”  The researchers also wanted to see if the simple perception of ecological threat was enough to forge the relationship between cultural tightness and prejudice. In an experiment, they asked participants from four countries to describe the most salient threat in their country, giving them a foreign attack or major recession as possible examples, along with an ecological crisis. When compared to control groups, the group asked to think about ecological threats showed greater support for cultural tightness. This tightness then predicted higher prejudice.  Special Event: Bridging Differences Join us to learn research-based strategies for dialogue and understanding Register Now  The researchers also surveyed both American and French voters in the 2016 and 2017 national elections, looking to see if there was an actual electoral relationship between support for cultural tightness and prejudice, and whom voters chose in an election. They found that “voters who believed their country was under threat were more likely to vote” for Republican nominee Donald Trump (who campaigned on restrictive immigration policies) and far-right French leader Marine LePen (who campaigned similarly). These preferences “could be fully explained by their support for cultural tightness and prejudice.”  This suggests that ecological threats are a major factor in fomenting prejudice and building support for right-wing political candidates, in the United States and abroad.  “The idea is that when people perceive threat (whether real or imagined), it produces a tight psychology, at least temporarily—people in these contexts want stronger rules (e.g., tightness) and begin to also show prejudice toward people who threaten the social order,” writes Gelfand in an email to Greater Good. This has electoral implications, suggests Jackson. “Climate change is leading to an uptick in . . . droughts, forest fires, coral reefs disappearing, and if this continues, then it might actually, counterintuitively, lead to an atmosphere where far-right nationalists find themselves elected more easily than they can now.”  Taken together, this batch of studies published in PLOS ONE show that social prejudice doesn’t just appear from the ether. When cultures feel threatened, they tighten their rules and norms out of the desire to protect themselves—which can unfortunately lead to scapegoating people who are deemed “outsiders.” This means that our leaders and news media should both be very careful about how they discuss threats, ecological and otherwise. Failing to do so could mean that we end up targeting the wrong problems—to everyone’s detriment.

Let’s just say it was a natural history museum. As you walked around, you might have been overwhelmed by the abundance of exhibits and mothball perfume. In Dublin, there are at least 10,000 items on display.  Everything, as Nigel Monaghan says, “from ants to aardvarks to zebras”. My personal favourites in the Dublin Natural History Museum, where Monaghan is the keeper, are the pangolins. They are related to anteaters and I had never heard of them before I saw them there.  Other specimens are fascinating for the history and stories behind them, like the trophy heads collected during British imperial expansion and the migratory birds gathered after they fatally collided with Irish lighthouses.  But providing weird and wonderful displays for the public is only a small part of what historical museums do. A museum is a place of living science, not just a place of preservation. Modern science needs historical collections and facilitating research is a crucial part of “keeping” a museum. Monaghan and his colleague Paolo Viscardi (assistant keeper with a focus on zoology) are enthusiastic about the scientific treasures they work to preserve.  Climate change and biodiversity are some of the big areas of science that museum collections can help researchers to study. As Monaghan puts it, “Museum collections are key to understanding biodiversity over the last few centuries.” And of course human actions have been a huge factor in reducing biodiversity over the same time period.  Monaghan points to a creative study using the museum’s 17,000 bird skins (birds that have been “boned and rolled”, he explains). Researchers interested in pollution have been examining old bird specimens to see what kind of particles have been clinging to their feathers for the past 100 or so years.  More recent scientific methods allow researchers to make new findings from old material. For example, Monaghan’s own interest is in Irish ice age fauna. A research group that he has worked with has been using bones collected in Ireland (mostly in cave deposits) during the 19th and 20th centuries.  With radio carbon dating and DNA analysis it is now possible to be much more accurate about which species were here and when. For example, scientists now believe that red deer actually arrived in Ireland with people around 5,000 years ago. The deer provided useful antlers for tools as well as meat and hides.  Paolo Viscardi draws my attention to the research importance of some of the smallest organisms held by the museum. There is a lot of recent interest, for example, in a collection of parasitic wasps created in the middle of the 19th century by Alexander Haliday. He opens one of Haliday’s entomology cases to show me and it’s fair to say they are bit less charismatic than pangolins.  Some of them are, as Viscardi says, “the size of a full stop”. Parasitic wasps “can be quite useful pest control agents” because different species of the wasps lay their eggs on those of another species of insect thus reducing its population without the need for pesticide.  Thanks to Haliday’s enthusiasm, probably not driven by an interest in organic agriculture, the Dublin museum has around 1,000 type specimens of parasitic wasps and researchers working on the group are keen to access them. This has meant painstaking efforts by the team in Dublin to rehouse the specimens in modern storage to prevent loss or damage.  Gluing tiny wasps to cards, as Haliday did, is no longer advised. Other collections of tiny organisms include thousands of nematodes (roundworms), many of which are type specimens. Many of these nematodes, Viscardi explains, came from an Irish bog and give information about soil health. While I am chatting with him Viscardi receives an email inquiry about the museum’s collection of stoats. They are of interest because Irish stoats are stoatally different (sorry) than British varieties: they don’t change their coat in the winter.  There is something reassuring about the way that the Dead Zoo doesn’t change much. I can return and find my pangolins any day I like. But behind the scenes our natural history museums are full of evidence of change.  Pangolins, for example, are under threat from poaching and might one day exist only in museum collections. The story of the changing natural world, and our role in that change, will continue to be the most important scientific story of the future.

Ms Long-Bailey, who turned 40 in September, said she had deliberated over her decision to run in the resulting leadership contest over the Christmas period. “Despite all the rumours that had been circulating in the media about there being succession plans, that it was me, or it was Angela [Rayner] or Laura [Pidcock], there wasn’t a succession plan because I don’t think anybody thought we were going to lose,” she added.  On her decision to run, she said: “I knew what Jeremy had been through over the last four years – it wasn’t a decision you could take easily. Basically you’re giving up your whole life to become leader of the Labour Party. Your family is affected by it detrimentally, so it’s not something you should ever run into.  “I knew I always had a strong drive, I was never really personally ambitious, really – I was ambitious for policy and what we could achieve and that’s what brought me to standing. I knew the transformation we could bring through the right policies could be achieved with the right message and right leader.”  But Labour faces a monumental task to emerge with a majority at the next election in May 2024. It must win at least 124 parliamentary seats – a scale of victory not experienced by the party since Tony Blair swept to power in 1997 with a three-figure majority.  Asked whether she thought that was possible under her leadership, Ms Long-Bailey replied: “Yeah, definitely. The general election just gone was the perfect storm for Labour. We had Brexit and many of our communities didn’t trust us on it. Many of my constituency who voted Leave in Salford thought we were trying to overturn the referendum result.  “Then if you were speaking to a Remain supporter, they thought we weren’t going far enough in having that strong relationship with the European Union. So that compromise solution that we tried didn’t satisfy many people at all.  “Then we weren’t trusted on a range of issues – the manifesto was one, because we hadn’t articulated a message and had a real kind of ground war campaign to articulate that message in a way that the Tories did. We weren’t trusted on tackling issues of antisemitism in the party. We weren’t trusted to be united as a party because we were all essentially at war with each other and there were briefings going on in the press, very publicly, between different people”.  According to the most recent Ipsos MORI figures, Ms Long-Bailey has the worst favourability ratings in the leadership contest with a -7 rating. Sir Keir Starmer, widely considered the favourite, has a net positive rating of +42 while Lisa Nandy, the Wigan MP, has a +43 rating. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, who is struggling to attract momentum behind her leadership campaign, has a -5 rating.  Labour leadership hustings in Cardiff on 2 February  Presented with these findings, Ms Long-Bailey said: “I think to my detriment – and this will change in the leadership campaign – is that I’ve always been in the background working rather than being out there on the media all the time. And people’s perceptions do change when you are out there and you can formulate the image you want to be presented to people.”  On the first day of parliament after the Christmas recess when the frontbencher announced her candidacy in an article for the socialist magazine Tribune, one Labour MP on the left said of her performance to the parliamentary party later that day: “It was boring; it was like watching paint dry.”  “You can’t win them all, can you?” Ms Long-Bailey said. “I don’t who that was, but maybe they should go for a drink with me.”  If elected to take the party into its next era in April, Ms Long-Bailey said she would assemble a “broad shadow cabinet”, bringing together talent from across the party. “I don’t want to give away names until I’ve had discussions with people because they might say no – but hopefully they wouldn’t,” she said.  “The role of the shadow chancellor is really, really crucial. It’s got to be someone who is capable because it’s one of the most complex jobs in the entire shadow cabinet and everything we’re able to achieve rests on the ability of that person. So it has to be someone that’s capable, but equally it’s got to be somebody that supports the policy direction that I am trying to push forward with a lot of people. I can’t give that away just yet.”  Asked whether she might consider providing her close friend Angela Rayner with a place in her top team, she added: “She’s going to be deputy leader. She might do – well, we can have a chat about it.”  But if she fails in her bid to succeed Mr Corbyn, Ms Long-Bailey said she will “do whatever it takes to make sure we elect a Labour government” when asked whether she would serve in her rivals’ shadow cabinets.  Rebecca Long-Bailey with Jeremy Corbyn during PMQs  “Whether that’s working on the backbenches, whether that’s helping with policy in the background, that’s my job as a Labour MP and party member to make sure we win,” she added.​  The frontbencher, whose constituency voted Leave by over 60 per cent, admitted she was “depressed” on Friday when Britain formally severed its ties with the EU after a 47-year membership, but didn’t stay up to watch the clock projected onto Downing Street to mark the “end of an era” at 11pm.  “I had to get up early the next day to go to a hustings,” she said. “So I had a Domino’s pizza, was a bit depressed and then went to bed.”  On the prospect of the UK ever rejoining the bloc, Ms Long-Bailey added: “I don’t think now it would be good for us a country to start rehearsing the arguments.

Driving the news: Rep. David McKinley (R-W.Va.) and Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.) want to require utilities to greatly cut carbon emissions by mid-century.  They laid out the broad strokes of their planned bill in a USA Today op-ed Thursday and through information circulated to reporters.  How it works: It would create a \"clean energy standard\" requiring an 80% cut in power sector emissions by 2050 while providing the industry all kinds of leeway to determine how to get there.  The mandate would not begin for up to 10 years, to be preceded by \"public and private investments in clean energy innovation and infrastructure development.\"  It would also inoculate the industry from Clean Air Act carbon emissions regulations during the 10-year ramp-up.  Why it matters: The plan says a lot about the state of climate politics. It signals the GOP shift away from rejecting or at least challenging consensus climate science.  McKinley was in that camp years ago but the new op-ed calls climate change the \"greatest environmental and energy challenge of our time.\"  The big picture: It's far less aggressive than what senior Capitol Hill Democrats and the party's White House hopefuls are promoting.  \"The plan is modest, compared to other Democratic proposals aiming to reach net-zero emissions by midcentury across the entire economy, and many states that have imposed immediate clean electricity standards without delay,\" the Washington Examiner notes.  Between the lines: Ideas for a federal \"clean energy standard\" of some sort have been rattling around for a decade.  I first started noticing them when Republicans floated them as an alternative to Democratic calls for renewables-specific mandates, and then-President Obama floated his own version in 2011.

It is the largest global pandemic in 100 years. Six months after emerging, it has killed over 600,000 people and is having a major impact on the global economy.  \"How much would it cost to prevent this happening again? And what are the principal actions that need to be put in place to achieve this?\" asked Andrew Dobson, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Princeton. He and colleague Stuart Pimm of Duke University assembled a team to seek answers.  Their team has now written a Policy Forum article for the journal Science, a research-based opinion piece. In it, the multidisciplinary group of epidemiologists, wildlife disease biologists, conservation practitioners, ecologists and economists argue that an annual investment of $30 billion would pay for itself quickly.  \"There have been at least four other viral pathogens that have emerged in the human population so far this century. Investment in prevention may well be the best insurance policy for human health and the global economy in the future,\" Pimm said.  Two major factors loom large as drivers of emerging pathogens: destruction of tropical forests and the wildlife trade. Each has contributed two of the four emerging diseases that have appeared in the last 50 years: COVID, Ebola, SARS, HIV.  Both deforestation and the wildlife trade also cause widespread damage to the environment on multiple fronts, so there are diverse benefits associated with reducing them, note the researchers. Increased monitoring and policing of these activities would allow future emerging viruses to be detected at a much earlier stage, when control could prevent further spread.  All the credible genetic evidence points to COVID-19 emerging from a bat species traded as food in China. The wildlife trade is a major component of the global economy, with principal economic products including food, medicine, pets, clothing and furniture. Some of these are traded as luxury goods, which can create an intimate association that enhances the risk of pathogen transmission to the merchant or the buyer. Wildlife markets are invariably poorly regulated and unsanitary.  The organization tasked with monitoring international wildlife trade -- the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) -- has a net global budget of \"a mere $6 million,\" said Dobson. \"Many of the 183 signatories are several years in arrears in their payments.\"  The monitoring of this trade needs to be expanded, the authors argue. In particular, scientists need vital information about the viral pathogens circulating in potential food and pet species. They suggest using regional and national wildlife trade monitoring groups, integrated with international organizations for monitoring animal health.  Monitoring and regulating this trade will not only ensure stronger protection for the many species threatened by the trade, it will also create a widely accessible library of genetic samples that can be used to identify novel pathogens when they emerge, say the authors. It will also generate a genetic library of viruses with two key roles: more speedily identifying the source and location of future emerging pathogens, and developing the tests needed to monitor future outbreaks.  Ultimately, this library will contain the information needed to speed the development of future vaccines.  Although there have been calls to close the \"wet markets\" where wild and domestic animals are sold, to prevent future outbreaks of emerging pathogens, the authors acknowledge that many people are dependent on wild-sourced foods and medicines, and suggest that better health oversight of domestic markets is required.  They suggest that the risk of new viruses emerging can be mitigated if more people are trained in monitoring, early detection and control of pathogens in wildlife trade, and working with local communities to minimize risks of exposure and onward transmission.  \"In China, for example, there are too few wildlife veterinarians, and the majority work in zoos and animal clinics,\" said co-author Binbin Li, an assistant professor of environmental science at Duke Kunshan University in Jiangsu, China.  \"Veterinarians are on the front line of defense against emerging pathogens, and globally we desperately need more people trained with these skills,\" noted Dobson.  The expansion and development of better ways to monitor and regulate the wildlife trade could be done for around $500 million a year, which the authors call \"a trivial cost\" when compared with the current costs of COVID, especially considering the add-on benefits such as curbing wildlife consumption and sustaining biodiversity.  Slowing tropical deforestation would also slow viral emergence, plus it would reduce carbon inputs into the atmosphere from forest fires and protect forest biodiversity. On the other hand, it reduces revenues from timber, grazing and agriculture.  Is it worth foregoing these tangible, but economically focused, benefits? The authors undertake this part of their cost-benefit analysis from two complementary economic perspectives: first ignoring and then including the benefits of carbon stored as a hedge against climate change. They make no attempt to put a value on the loss of biodiversity.  The Policy Forum article sharply focuses on the bottom-line costs needed to prevent the next COVID.  \"Pathogen emergence is essentially as regular an event as national elections: once every 4 to 5 years,\" said co-author Peter Daszak, an epidemiologist with Ecohealth Alliance in New York, pointing to numerous studies. \"New pathogens have appeared at roughly the same rate as new presidents, congressmen, senators and prime ministers!\"  \"We may see the costs of COVID soar to beyond $8 to $15 trillion with many millions of people unemployed and living under lockdown,\" said co-author Amy Ando, a professor of agricultural and consumer economics at the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign.  The annual cost of preventing future outbreaks is roughly comparable to 1 to 2% of annual military spending by the world's 10 wealthiest countries. \"If we view the continuing battle with emerging pathogens such as COVID-19 as a war we all have to win, then the investment in prevention seems like exceptional value,\" Dobson said.   ###  \"Ecology and economics for pandemic prevention,\" by Andrew P.

(Photo: Zach Boyden-Holmes/The Register)Buy Photo  Editor's note: This story by Register reporter Mike Kilen originally ran in March 2017.  KEARNEY, Neb. — Sandhill cranes have been called “the lords of the dance.\" So we wait for the sun to rise in the dark blind in the middle of Nebraska to see it.  But as light softly bathes the river, what we see is more profound than just the joyful leaping that makes these big birds special. Thousands of cranes cover the river as far as one can see to the east and west.  Throughout March, more than half a million sandhill cranes — 85 percent of the world’s population — rest and feed in rural Nebraska, only a five-hour drive west of Des Moines. They attract visitors from around the world to what is called North America’s greatest migration.  These ancient birds once flew above prehistoric creatures, and they are still at it, regardless of humans below them now, driving metal contraptions at 75 miles per hour on nearby Interstate 80 while eating Subway.  The long-legged beauties, standing more than 4 feet tall, with a wingspan of 6 feet, migrate every year through an 80-mile wide bottleneck of Nebraska and stay here to feed in the fields and play on the Platte River.  The cranes have become a growing tourist draw in the last 25 years. The economic impact to the Kearney and Grand Island area is near $10 million, said Kearney Visitors Bureau officials. And Iowans are contributors in busloads on county conservation and tour group excursions or individual road trips.  \"It was a moving and spiritual experience,\" said Don Ohde of Cedar Rapids, of the mid-March day he witnessed thousands of cranes fill the skies.  At just one location, the Audubon’s Rowe Sanctuary, 17,000 people every spring vie for reservations in blinds situated along the river.  “This is a wildlife experience you can’t find anywhere else in the world,” said Kent Skaggs, general manager of the Ian Nicolson Audubon Center at Rowe Sanctuary near Gibbon. “It’s one of those bucket list things for a lot of people.”  Why the cranes vacation in Nebraska  Register photographer Zach Boyden-Holmes and I travel the stretch of I-80 familiar to Iowans, usually enduring Nebraska to go somewhere else, until we get off the interstate past Grand Island, down gravel roads among pastures and prairies. Our destination is a single-story ranch, a lodge for The Nature Conservancy of Nebraska.  Such is the popularity of the crane viewing that Sara McClure, the conservancy’s director of major gifts, is busy putting together a special dinner and viewing blind wine and cheese package for donors. These aren’t just your “bird nerds,” she said, but those taken by the new trend of eco-tourism.  Before taking the short trip down to conservancy land along the Platte for a sunset viewing, McClure tells us why the birds are here. The sandhill cranes likely always migrated from Mexico and southwestern-most U.S. locations in the spring on their way to breeding and nesting grounds as far north as Siberia.  But their path was wider, including Colorado and Iowa. The wide and shallow Platte River, which formed 11,000 years ago, was a crane favorite, especially after habitat decreased elsewhere and the growth of agriculture starting 150 years ago left waste corn for crane carbo-loading during a weeks-long pause in the middle of a lengthy trip.  The area became a concentrated riot of cranes at an extended-stay rest stop.  As the sunset looms, we join McClure and Bill and Katie Stevens, a couple from Moab, Utah, in a weathered wooden shack blind cut with square viewing holes facing the river.  By 6:30 p.m. we see the first cranes flying from the west in small flocks, high above the river, and going past. Each group flies lower as the sun begins its descent behind thick clouds.  Soaring above, we see the straight-necked flight that distinguishes them from herons and hear their famous call, a trill that is loud, yet gentle.  The cranes are attractive to people for other reasons. They are big birds, there are a lot of them, and they're in easy view, McClure said. They mate for life and people tend to like the idea of fidelity.  They roost on the wide river at night, finding the ribbons of sandy shallows that are perfect to settle on, and the large-group water roosting offers protection against night predators such as coyote or fox.  By the dozens they arrive, kicking out their landing gear feet on spindly legs to glide on the river and gather in groups. Their trills create a chorus that crescendos. Wave after wave of them fills the sky for miles.  “It reminds me of the scene with the flying monkeys in the ‘Wizard of Oz,’\" McClure said.  Buy Photo Paula Scherbroeck, of Davenport, shoots photos near near the Rowe Sanctuary in Nebraska Wednesday, March 22, 2017. (Photo: Zach Boyden-Holmes/The Register)  We see the distinct red eye mask and soft gray plumage as they settle. The trill is occasionally interrupted by a higher-pitched call of juveniles bugging their parents.  A group of seven deer walks across the shallows, but caught in the middle of a group of very loud big birds, retreats to the river bank. A large beaver gnaws on a stick in front of the blind.  The wildlife coexist, but the crane can claim superior adaptability. It now gets 90 percent of its diet here from corn, which wasn’t here in centuries before, and climate change hasn’t had measurable effect on their migration. While the whooping crane is endangered, the population of sandhill cranes continues to thrive.  McClure had said this viewing came with no guarantees; they are wildlife, after all. But most of the river in front of us and to our sides is filled now with cranes as it grows dark.  “They are ancient,” said Katie Stevens. “They were here a long time before we were, and they will be here a long time after we are gone.”  A morning dance like no other  We want to see the dance, so the next morning we rise early to arrive at the Rowe Sanctuary by 6, where a group of photographers has paid $60 each for a spot in a blind. The other blinds cost less and are simply for viewing. They sell out quickly, especially during mid-March, and are sold out to month’s end. The week before, the crane population here peaked at 400,000.  Precautions against spooking the cranes create an almost spiritual aura as the group travels silently in the dark though a field to the river-side blind. We are sneaking up on the cranes. Audubon volunteer Steve Martindale had told us that after the blind’s hatches are opened with painstaking care, we are not to move side to side, only forward and back — a movement the cranes can’t detect.  We stand still and silent in the dark and wait, camera lenses pointed to the river. We hear a softer trill than the night before, growing by the minute as the cranes begin to move about, only dark clumps in the river visible now.  Iowans had told us that we would see one of nature’s most impressive shows. Paula Scherbroeck, 63, and her husband, Scott, 62, of the Quad Cities said they have been following migrations in their retirement, and trips to Africa or following the snow geese in the U.S. didn’t match the wonder of these cranes they have seen for the first time.  “You are right in the middle of it, so it’s a totally different experience,” said Paula, whom we caught up with while viewing cranes at their mid-morning corn field-stubble feeding locations nearby. “Everyone talks about bears, but these birds are just as beautiful.”  “Not a lot impresses me anymore,” said Scott, who used to hunt but now finds joy in watching. “This impresses me.”  Buy Photo Sandhill cranes play as they start their day in the Platte River on Rowe Sanctuary near Gibbon, Neb., Wednesday, March 22, 2017. (Photo: Zach Boyden-Holmes/The Register)  We are about to witness it as the darkness starts to subside.  The trill grows as we begin to see their forms awaken with short bursts of movement, like popcorn popping. As it grows lighter, it becomes apparent that as far as the eye can see in each direction, thousands of birds are on the river.  The dancing begins. Many say words cannot describe it. The cranes lower their long necks then unfurl them in a skyward funky-chicken. They spring up, a joyful two-footed leap in the air. Other times, they do a 360-degree spin, or kick their legs forward, or prance side to side, or offer a gentle curtsy.  The experts have told us it is showing off. Sometimes, if they don’t have a partner, it’s a little preening. It’s also play, or burning off energy.  “It looks like fun,” Skaggs said. “And humans can relate to fun.”  Two cranes play with a mucky object washed up on the sandbar, tossing it in the air. Others peck each other and run like kids, probably young males in a bit of competition.  Three moments that can’t be forgotten happen as the morning display nears an end.  Sun breaks through the clouds for just a couple of minutes. Most of the birds face east. The cranes are lit by the sun’s rays and appear to glow, framed by the dark clouds behind them. It’s no wonder that this has become a photographer’s mecca.  Later, the mass of cranes stops its loud chorus of trills to nearly complete silence for a minute before starting again. No one can explain it. It just happens.  The last moment stuns us. Thousands of cranes explode into flight. No one says a word until they are all long gone, leaving the river empty.  Finally, a photographer breaks the silence: “It was like applause.” Like the grand finale at the fireworks display, said another.  Thousands of years of tradition and thoughts of our own short time on the planet joined the rush of flight. It’s understandable why ashes have been tossed here by loved ones left with instructions to \"remember me when the cranes come.\"  WHERE TO VIEW THE CRANES  Ian Nicolson Audubon Center at Rowe Sanctuary, 44450 Elm Island Rd., Gibbon, Neb. Blind reservations are required.  Fort Kearny State Recreation Area, 1020 V Road, Kearney, Nebraska.  The Nature Conservancy in Nebraska offers crane viewing for members of any state at its blinds near Wood River, Nebraska.  Cranes can also be viewed at some bridges and along gravel roads between Kearney and Grand Island where cranes are roosting on the river or feeding in the fields. Viewing blinds are also set up at some locations where cranes rest in grassy field “loafing areas” before returning to the river at night to roost.   IN IOWA  Sandhill crane populations are growing in Iowa, which they largely abandoned in the late 1800s. Migrant populations are not large but since first nesting began here in 1992, there are more reports of sandhill cranes at Chichaqua Bottoms Greenbelt near Des Moines and marshes and wetlands in northeast Iowa. Conservation officials in northeast Iowa say spring migrations in Sweet Marsh near Tripoli have seen groups of 100 cranes at a time at the wetland.

The latest proposal represents another handout to polluters. The proposed changes call for expediting major federal actions like new drilling, mining, and unnecessary development of new fossil fuel infrastructure and directs our agencies to ignore the impacts of climate change and our health.  At present, the NEPA requires completion of a rigorous environmental review that incorporates the concerns of local communities and determines whether a proposed infrastructure project may have a significant environmental impact. NEPA promotes environmental justice by requiring federal agencies to study and disclose a proposed project’s potential environmental, economic, social, and health impacts on low-income, minority, and rural communities. It also provides opportunities for meaningful input from those affected communities.The Trump administration is seeking changes to current NEPA policy that would rollback necessary protective measures of the approval process, making it easier for polluters to acquire approval absent of diligent oversight.  On February 25th, the Sierra Club and partners protested proposed rollback at an organized rally and heard individuals representing impacted communities.  Shortcutting environmental reviews doesn’t just cost taxpayer money, it jeopardizes worker safety as well as the health of our local communities. As sea levels continue to rise and extreme weather events become more frequent, NEPA ensures our roads, bridges, and other infrastructure are engineered to be more resilient to the increasingly severe effects of climate change.  Quotations from participants at the NEPA hearing and rally:  -“We felt great urgency about coming to the NEPA hearing in person. NEPA’s mission to perform in-depth environmental impact and justice reviews of the ecosystems and communities where polluting infrastructure is planned has already been greatly diminished. Now, at stake are very public comment periods where independent scientific experts and impacted peoples bring factual evidence of these impacts and injustices to decision-makers — to directly to counter biased industry sponsored data that erases these harms. These protections need to be strengthened not eliminated,” says Lakshmi Fjord, Heidi Dhivya Berthoud, and Swami Dayananda with Friends of Buckingham.  -Lakshmi Fjord, anthropologist: “We beg you, please reinforce what’s already there. Do not take away any of these protections.”  -Joelle Novey, Director of Interfaith Power and Light, regarding the proposed changes: “it’s wrong and it stinks.”  -Vickie Wheaton, nurse, regarding the impact of proposed changes on disadvantaged communities: “when the needs of a few are valued over the needs of the many, it never goes well.”  -Dr. Mildred McClain of Savannah’s Harambe organization. “We will not be silent…NEPA is our tool, it’s the people’s tool…we are going to fight, fight, fight for our environment.”  A public-facing link to photos from the rally and hearing: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oDFQ7jOHoUJqCvtGorFpC0eCXgTlrEQW?usp=sharing   ###  About the Sierra Club Virginia Chapter: The Virginia Chapter of the Sierra Club is over 20,000 members strong.

Qu also met Khusro Bakhtiar, Pakistan's Federal Minister of National Food Security and Research and together they endorsed a $500,000 Technical Cooperation Programme (TCP) to make FAO’s technical expertise available to national experts in order to strengthen their capacities to combat the Desert Locust infestation and improve locust management.  “Locusts are the oldest migratory pest in the world,” Qu said on Sunday. “They have a high capacity to multiply, form groups and migrate over relatively large distances.”  During his field visit in Punjab province, Qu said he was inspired by the resilience and strength of rural communities in Pakistan.  “Smallholder farmers are using climate-smart approaches & lessons learnt from FAO farmer field schools to find local innovative solutions which contribute to their household food security,” the Director-General said.  He also said he was proud of the excellent work by FAO staff who are bringing their knowledge and resources to the country’s most vulnerable people.  “Our staff are promoting climate resilient agricultural practices in rural communities to support their livelihoods,” he said.

The worst-hit area is the Sakha Republic, where Verkhoyansk is located, with 929,000 hectares (2.295 million acres) burning.  The Sakha Republic’s fire service reported 127 natural fires in the Russian federal sector.  The fires and heat are due to the climate crisis, Weather Channel meteorologist Carl Parker told Newsweek.  “What climate change is doing is moving the distribution of weather events, such that historically low-frequency, extreme events occur more frequently,” said Parker. “Had the climate not changed due to man-made greenhouse gases, the heat we’ve seen in parts of Siberia would have been a 100,000-year event.”  Parker warned that the fires are part of a dangerous feedback loop in the northern region.  “What’s scary about the warming in Siberia is that there are huge quantities of carbon in permafrost, which can be unleashed during periods like this, particularly as fires develop in the region,” said Parker.

Temperatures in Siberia for the first five months of 2020 were an average 14° F over normal.  “That’s much, much warmer than it’s ever been over that region in that period of time,” Zeke Hausfather, a Berkeley Earth climate scientist, told AP.

The policy-heavy, relatively sedate debate stood in stark contrast to last week's chaotic presidential showdown between Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, which was marred by Trump's constant interruptions and personal insults from both men.  Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis, along with his age and that of Biden, added weight to the debate, as both Pence, 61, and Harris, 55, sought to demonstrate they were capable of assuming the office if needed. Either the Republican Trump, 74, or Biden, 77, would be the oldest U.S president to be sworn into office if victorious in November.  But Wednesday's confrontation seemed unlikely to alter the dynamics of a race that opinion polls show Biden is winning with less than four weeks to the Nov. 3 election, as both candidates evaded certain questions, stuck to talking points and avoided major gaffes.  Harris, the California U.S. senator and former state attorney general, immediately went after Trump's record on the pandemic that has claimed 210,000 American lives and devastated the economy.  Watch the full debate below:  \"The American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country,\" Harris said as the debate began at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.  In response, Pence blamed China for the pandemic and touted the U.S. administration's efforts to battle the disease, including Trump's decision in late January to restrict travel from the pandemic's epicenter in China.  \"I want the American people to know that from the very first day, President Donald Trump has put the health of America first,\" he said. \"China is to blame for the coronavirus, and President Trump is not happy about it,\" he added.  The two candidates were separated by 12 feet and plexiglass shields, a reminder of the virus that has led to the largest public health crisis in a century.  Harris, who made her own unsuccessful run for the presidency, faced enormous pressure as she took the biggest political stage of her life. On Wednesday, she largely succeeded at fulfilling the running mate's traditional attack role.  Pence delivered the kind of calm, reasoned points that the combative Trump rarely offers, but the president's propensity for grabbing headlines is likely to overshadow his second-in-command's performance almost immediately.   Masks and social distancing  Pence was questioned about the administration's White House event last month announcing Trump's latest Supreme Court nomination, where masks and social distancing were mostly absent. A number of prominent attendees, including the president himself, have since tested positive for COVID-19.  The vice president noted that the event was outdoors before criticizing Harris and Biden, who have promised to mandate masks on federal property and encourage the practice nationwide, for not respecting people's freedom to make their own choices on health.  \"You respect the American people when you tell them the truth,\" Harris retorted, noting that Trump played down the virus for months.  Harris faulted the Trump administration for trying to invalidate the Affordable Care Act healthcare law in the midst of a pandemic and assailing Trump for reportedly paying $750 a year in federal income taxes as president.  \"When I first heard about it, I literally said, 'You mean $750,000?'\" Harris said, referring to a New York Times investigation. \"And it was like, 'No — $750.' \"  She also warned that the Trump administration's challenge to the ACA would enable insurance companies to deny coverage to patients with pre-existing conditions: \"If you love someone who has a pre-existing condition, they're coming for you.\"  Pence called the ACA, popularly known as Obamacare, a \"disaster.\"  The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments over the law a week after the election. Republicans are working to seat Trump's conservative nominee to the court, Amy Coney Barrett, by month's end over the objections of Democrats.   Tax battle  Pence sought to counter Harris's attacks by turning the focus to the economy and tax policy, saying: \"On Day One, Joe Biden's going to raise your taxes.\" Harris responded by saying that Biden has vowed not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year.  The vice president also asserted that Biden would ban fracking and embrace the Green New Deal, a massive environmental proposal backed by liberal Democrats. Biden, however, has rejected both of those positions.  Asked about a potential vaccine, Harris said she would only trust the word of scientists, rather than that of Trump, who has promoted unproven treatments in the past.  \"If the doctors tell us that we should take it, I'll be the first in line to take it, absolutely,\" she said. \"But if Donald Trump tells us to take it, I'm not taking it.\"  Pence fired back, accusing Harris of undermining public confidence in vaccines. \"I think it is unconscionable,\" he said. \"Stop playing politics with people's lives.\"   Race an issue  Harris, the first Black woman to serve on a major-party presidential ticket, also attacked Pence on race relations, criticizing Trump for turning down an opportunity to denounce white supremacists at last week's debate with Biden.  In response, Pence accused the media of taking Trump's words out of context and said the president had repeatedly disavowed racist groups.  Biden leads Trump in national opinion polls and has an advantage of 12 percentage points in the latest Reuters/Ipsos survey of likely voters. Polls show the race to be closer in some of the election battleground states that could determine the winner, although a Reuters/Ipsos poll on Wednesday showed Biden leading Trump in pivotal Florida.  Harris, who was on the biggest stage of her political career, is the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India and the first person of Asian descent on a major-party presidential ticket, as well as the first Black woman.  Pence, a former conservative radio host, is a former U.S. congressman and Indiana governor who has steadfastly defended Trump during his tumultuous presidency.  In addition to competing for November's election, the two candidates were also jockeying for long-term position in their respective parties. Both are widely seen as future presidential candidates, whatever the outcome of November's contest.  It was the only vice presidential debate of the campaign. Biden and Trump are due for a rematch on Oct. 15 and 22.

Oil producers were literally willing to pay people almost $40 a barrel at one point to take their product. It was the first time in history that had happened.  Trading has recovered since then, but crude oil prices remain crushingly low, and are now a genuine existential threat to the U.S. oil and energy sector. That's inspired demands for a federal bailout of the industry, including from President Trump himself — along with a chorus of opponents saying the industry isn't worth saving. But depending on what we mean by \"bailout,\" this could be a moment of historic opportunity for the climate change movement.  First, though, what in God's name just happened?  The last decade's boom in North American shale oil production was a mixed blessing: It created a bunch of jobs and made America a net exporter of oil, but it also flooded the international market with supply. Meanwhile, demand for oil was being eroded by gains in energy efficiency, green energy, and green tech. Much of the remaining global supply is controlled by state-run oil producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia, who dump supply into the market based on geopolitical strategy as much as market signals. This big ramp up of supply relative to demand led to a price crash several years ago, from which the industry has been slowly recovering.  Then came the coronavirus pandemic. The stay-at-home orders and economy-wide lockdowns, both in the U.S. and around the world, sent that already-soft demand for oil into a nosedive. If massive parts of society are no longer working, commuting, flying, etc, they have no need for fuel. Then Saudi Arabia and Russia got into a price war, and ramped up production in an effort to sabotage both the U.S. industry and each other. President Trump managed to broker a detente, but the agreed-to production cuts were not nearly enough to balance the lower demand, so prices kept plunging.  Of course, if the supply of oil is far outpacing demand, all that excess oil has to go somewhere. And there's a whole market for oil storage that smooths out these price falls. The problem is, the current glut is so extreme that this market has literally run out of physical storage. There's just nowhere to put the oil anymore. So when the oil storage contracts for the month of May settled early this week, oil producers literally found themselves having to pay the storage people to take the oil and figure out what to do with it. Hence the price plunge into negative territory.  We're past the May contracts hump now, and the situation for June looks marginally better, so oil prices have recovered after Monday’s dive. But they're still below $15 a barrel, which is just insanely cheap.  (Graph courtesy of the U.S. Energy Information Agency.)  The other key thing is that the U.S. oil sector is buried in debt. Oil production, and especially shale oil production, is a capital-intensive industry, and it's only becoming more so as all the easy-to-get oil is tapped out. As impressive as the domestic oil boom was this past decade, it had to be fueled by a ton of borrowing. The industry now owes $86 billion that's coming due between now and 2024 — a lot of which is risky, low-quality debt. Pipeline companies owe another $123 billion over the same period.  Even before the coronavirus crisis, the financial industry was not happy about this, and a lot of oil company bankruptcies seemed likely. Now the situation seems genuinely apocalyptic: U.S. producers need almost $50 a barrel to be profitable. Below $40 a barrel, 15 percent of U.S. oil companies wouldn't make it past a year, and another 24 percent likely wouldn't make it past two, according to reporting by CNN. At $20 a barrel, basically everyone is seriously losing money, and over 500 U.S. producers would have to file for bankruptcy by the end of 2021. At $10 a barrel, you're looking at over 1,000 bankruptcies. Just to remind you, we're currently under $15 a barrel.  No one knows how long the coronavirus pandemic and the necessary social distancing will last. But given that most projections put a vaccine at well over a year away, oil prices staying under $20 until the end of 2021 seems entirely possible. In which case, the U.S. oil industry is going to get absolutely decimated.  That brings us to the question of how, or even whether, to save it. Congress has passed big aid programs for both big businesses and small, but the oil industry falls into a weird no man's land in between. As I said, President Trump himself has begun pushing a bailout specifically for that sector. And his critics are pushing back: We need to get global carbon emissions to zero by 2050, the U.S. oil industry is one of the biggest obstacles to that effort, and it’s a dying industry that irresponsibly loaded up on debt anyway. So why squander the money on it?  Here's the thing, though: The problem with the oil industry is that it's run by people who don't want it to die. But what if it was run by people who did recognize the need to ultimately dismantle fossil fuel production? If the federal government just straight-up nationalized the industry in the near future, it would have almost three decades to transition its workers and physical capital into green sectors, wind down oil production to zero, and figure out what to do about plastics and petrochemicals. Among progressive climate activists, there are burgeoning proposals to do just that. And right now, thanks to the coronavirus crisis, the oil industry has never been a cheaper bargain. Haliburton's stock is down by two-thirds. ExxonMobil's is down by 38 percent. Every energy company on the S&P 500 could be bought out for a grand total of about $700 billion — or roughly one-third of what the U.S. government just spent on the CARES Act.  As I said, it seems likely the oil industry's value won't recover much by early next year. Assuming the Democrats retake the government in November, they should absolutely make this gambit part of a larger Green New Deal effort.  In the meantime, an oil industry bailout in the here and now, depending on how it's structured, could also lay the groundwork for that. If the federal government just gives the oil industry straight cash or cheap loans, that's obviously not good. But lawmakers are also discussing a deal whereby the government takes ownership of the surplus oil that's in excess of demand, or it gets oil industry stock in exchange for aid. In that case, the federal government could get to decide when — or if — that excess oil ever gets consumed at all. And if the shares the government gets from the industry are voting shares (a key and critical point), it could begin to wield influence over big oil's corporate governance. Then, assuming Democrats win in November, they can use that power as a stepping stone to grab up the rest of the industry.  In other words, if progressives and Democrats play their cards right, an oil industry \"bailout\" could help save the global climate.

In their acceptance speeches on November 7, President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris included combating climate change on their to-do list for healing the nation. After a campaign filled with climate change-related policies, committees, speeches, and commercials, the Biden administration has what many experts are calling a mandate to act on the climate crisis.  Before the administration can start making large, meaningful strides in this mandate, however, it will first need to play catch-up, repairing the damage done by the Trump administration. Much of this work will include repealing harmful executive orders, reversing regulations that hinder science, and reinstating research policies, budgets, and advisory boards. It will also include the enormous task of rebuilding public trust in science, restoring a culture of scientific integrity, reviving the morale of discouraged federal workers, reconvincing scientists that public service can be a rewarding and honorable career path, and re-staffing agencies with a new generation of diverse talents and expertise. It will take a lot of hard work, and it won’t all be done by January 21.  But the incoming administration can make progress on all this needed restoration and move forward on the goals outlined in Biden’s clean energy and environmental justice proposal right now: by laying out plans for a new, Cabinet-level Department of Climate. In fact, rumblings about the creation of a “White House office for Climate Mobilization,” similar in structure to the National Security Council, started circulating in early October.  The idea of a high-level executive body focused on climate is not radical. Countries around the world — from Austria to Australia, Pakistan to Portugal — have created dedicated departments or ministries specifically to address climate change threats.  Establishing new Cabinet departments in the US isn’t that unusual either. In fact, more than half of the government’s 15 active departments have been formed in just the past 75 years. But among these executive-level departments and in all the hundreds of federal agencies, not one has a mission solely dedicated to the climate crisis. There isn’t even one with the word “climate” in its name.  Related How Joe Biden plans to use executive powers to fight climate change  To meet the threat of climate change, one of the first actions of the Biden administration and the 117th Congress should be to create a Department of Climate. Its mission would be to mitigate global climate change, reduce America’s vulnerability to climate impacts, build resiliency to the impacts that do occur, and strengthen the nation’s infrastructure by forging a sustainable, thriving, and just economy.  Here are three reasons why the US needs this new agency, how to do it, and why now is the time to start building one:  1) Climate change is a threat to our security — and we need a unified structure to fight it  Climate change is a critical national security challenge that will not be resolved over the course of one administration. In a report published earlier this year, the nonpartisan nonprofit Center for Climate and Security identified several major ways in which climate change puts national security at risk. These include: social and political instability due to drought and water stress, damages to military bases and infrastructure from rising seas and increased flooding, and detrimental effects on force readiness and health caused by more frequent heat waves and wildfires.  But perhaps the greatest risk to national security is the fact that climate change threatens our health, social equity, and economy, weakening the nation’s resilience. Current and future climate impacts put our very life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness at risk. It is well past time we defend against such threats.  When the US faced grave security threats in the past, it rose to those challenges by reorganizing the executive branch. For instance, after World War II, Congress enacted the National Security Act of 1947 and it was signed by President Truman. The Act reorganized military and intelligence branches, established the National Security Council and Central Intelligence Agency, and merged the War and Navy department into what became the Department of Defense.  Following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the Department of Homeland Security was established, integrating 22 different federal agencies and offices into one unified Cabinet department. In a message to Congress on June 18, 2002, President George W. Bush wrote: “History teaches us that new challenges require new organizational structures. History also teaches us that critical security challenges require clear lines of responsibility and the unified effort of the US Government.”  Although there is currently no one department or agency focused solely on climate change, there are many people spread across the federal government working on climate-related issues. In fact, one would be hard-pressed to find an agency that does not already work on some element of climate change: from monitoring current environmental conditions to projecting climate impacts, from creating innovative energy solutions to building climate-resilient communities.  But this legion of civil servants, who have devoted their careers to combating climate change, are fragmented and lack that clear line of responsibility President Bush described as necessary to address critical security challenges. These leading experts could be convened under one broad mission, with the potential for producing unified actions and outcomes far greater than the sum of their disaggregated parts.  Just as the Department of Homeland Security promises “relentless resilience” to attacks against the United States, a Department of Climate could deploy this same mindset, ensuring the US has the foundation it needs to take on the threats climate change poses to this nation and to future generations.  2) Climate change is a threat to our health — and we need dedicated resources to respond to it  In the US, Americans are already experiencing more frequent extreme heat days, increases in wildfires that lead to poor air quality (which likely makes people more susceptible to Covid-19), more severe storms with long-term, devastating health impacts, and longer seasons for disease-carrying mosquitoes and ticks. Rising carbon dioxide levels means longer and more severe allergy seasons and less nutritious crops. Not to mention the impact on our mental health.  As the House Select Committee points out in its Climate Crisis Action Plan, “the United States currently lacks a comprehensive national strategy to respond to the health risks and harms of the climate crisis.” Their plan calls for Congress to strengthen such planning, placing much of the burden of action on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Related House Democrats just put out the most detailed climate plan in US political history  However, federal health agencies’ ability to focus on climate-related health impacts is currently inadequate. This is in part due to leadership that is dismissive of climate change — and in part because their attention is, understandably, on the Covid-19 pandemic. And the 2018 hurricane season before that, and Zika before that, and Ebola before that. While the CDC and other health agencies are full of experts working to mitigate climate-related health threats, their priorities will always be driven by the next new global health crisis — and by each new administration’s political whims.  A new department would not be completely immune to the same geopolitical winds that tug on other federal agencies’ attention; but a dedicated budget and clear language in its mission mandating action on climate change would better position it against such winds. Instead of each new administration interpreting whether work on climate falls within the scope of an agency’s mission, there would be no question that addressing climate change is within the purview of a Department of Climate.  While there are many offices or divisions across numerous agencies engaged in work related to energy or transportation, these cross-cutting topics nevertheless have Cabinet-level leadership and congressionally determined budgets to ensure their missions are met regardless of who sits in the White House. As with education, labor, or agriculture, we should have a Department of Climate so that our nation always has the clear dedication of resources it needs to concentrate on crucial issues.  The department could take the lead on addressing climate threats to human health — collaborating with the CDC and other health agencies to strengthen, not further tax our health sector — and obviate the seasonal question of whether the US is making climate change a priority or not.  3) Climate change is a threat to equity — and we need to build the capacity to do better  Climate change threatens our health, but it does not threaten it equally. Certain communities are disproportionately vulnerable to climate change, including children, older adults, people with pre-existing health conditions, low-income communities, certain occupational groups, Indigenous peoples, and many communities of color.  As we see with Covid-19, discrimination leads to disproportionate rates of illnesses and deaths from environmental health hazards among Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous peoples.  Climate change does not just exacerbate the impacts of racism, it is also caused by white supremacy, a snake eating its own tail. As Hop Hopkins wrote for the advocacy group the Sierra Club: “You can’t have climate change without sacrifice zones, and you can’t have sacrifice zones without disposable people, and you can’t have disposable people without racism.”  And people of color — who, as the writer and podcast host Mary Annaïse Heglar points out, have faced their own existential threats for hundreds of years and have unrivaled experience building activist movements — often do not have enough seats at the table when it comes to developing or implementing environmental policy.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) work to enforce health and safety rules and pursue criminal anti-pollution cases, efforts Biden’s environmental justice plan proposes to strengthen. But even providing more resources to these existing government structures won’t be enough to guarantee meaningful involvement of all people to address climate change. We need to build out additional capacity and create more jobs in the environmental justice field.  One way to do this is by building divisions in the Department of Climate that, in addition to helping the EPA and DOJ prosecute violators of environmental protections, work to prioritize those communities made most vulnerable to climate change and ensure diverse voices are part of the climate solution.  By bringing in more people with social movement-building experience and new voices from communities often unheard, we could accomplish so much more — and more quickly. This is important because the world has a lot of lost time to make up for in terms of fighting climate change and systemic inequity. The threads of these two existential threats are intricately and tragically interwoven; the most effective way to unravel them is to solve them together.  A Department of Climate, not just working for the people disproportionately affected, but made of the people with the most expertise in social justice and the most knowledge of their communities’ unique needs and strengths, would give the US its best chance of implementing creative, long-lasting, and just solutions to climate change.  What the future could hold in the Biden administration  The United States has faced crises in the past, as we do today, and will again. We don’t need to look very far back in history for examples of how effective federal restructuring can provide the means to meet such challenges. Try reading these lines from the 2002 Proposal to Create the Department of Homeland Security with the words “climate change” swapped in to see just how easily a Department of Climate could be proposed:  “Today, no single government agency has homeland security climate change as its primary mission. In fact, responsibilities for homeland security climate change are dispersed among more than 100 different government organizations. America needs a single, unified homeland security climate change structure that will improve protection against today’s threats and be flexible enough to help meet the unknown threats of the future.”  And the power of a Climate Department would go beyond even its ability to take meaningful, sustained action. It would also signify a new, permanent prioritization of the climate crisis among the country’s top concerns, a move that has been sorely missing. It would be an immediate acknowledgement to millions of voters that the Biden administration is taking their mandate to act on climate seriously. It would be a clear signal to our country’s youth and to the communities most at-risk that they don’t have to take on the entire burden of addressing climate change themselves. And it would be a loud message to the rest of the world that the United States is finally ready to be a leader among the global community fighting climate change.  We have the urgency of the crisis to drive us, the mandate to move us forward, the precedence to guide us, the blueprint to build it, the experts to unify it, and the leaders to enact it— everything we need to create a response commensurate to the size of this huge task.

Los arenales ocupan más de un tercio de la línea costera mundial: tienen un alto valor socioeconómico y proporcionan protección natural ante las tormentas marinas y los ciclones. Sin embargo, la erosión, el aumento del nivel del mar y los patrones de cambio climático amenazan seriamente su trazado, sus infraestructuras y sus poblaciones.  Tras bucear en bases de datos e imágenes de satélite analizando los cambios en las líneas de costas entre 1984 y el 2015, un equipo de la Universidad de Delf (Holanda), dirigido por Michaleis Vosdoukas, determinó cómo será el escenario futuro teniendo en cuenta factores físicos (geológicos o antropogénicos. También, de qué manera se alterará la erosión debido a las tormentas y cuánto retrocedería el litoral debido al aumento del nivel del mar. Los resultados concluyen que, si los seres humanos no se ponen las pilas, «casi la mitad de las playas del mundo se situarían bajo amenaza de extinción a finales de siglo». Si, en cambio, se hace algo al respecto, esa previsión se podría reducir en un 40 %.  Al desastre ecológico y medioambiental que esto supone, recoge Efe, habría que sumar las pérdidas en términos de valor ecosistémico y los impactos socioeconómicos severos que podrían producirse, especialmente en áreas menos desarrolladas o con una dependencia fuerte del turismo relacionado con la costa. Tampoco se puede pasar por alto que un alto porcentaje de las playas amenazadas se encuentran en zonas densamente pobladas, por lo que es muy importante la necesidad de diseñar y aplicar medidas de adaptación eficaces ante estos posibles cambios.  En cualquier caso, los expertos señalan que aunque el calentamiento global se desacelerara, la sociedad tendría que adaptarse a una considerable pérdida de arenales, por lo que habría que hacer planes de mitigación de daños, más eficaces si se diseñan a nivel regional y local.  Las playas son dinámicas -explican- y tienen mecanismos de adaptación natural por los que retroceden, pero al mismo nivel en que se encuentran. Sin embargo, cuando el litoral está urbanizado y ocupa la zona de migración hacia atrás de la playa, la adaptación natural es más difícil, y si se topa con un obstáculo vertical, un muro o un edificio, la playa pierde altura y se va hundiendo.  El informe indica que si se analiza la longitud total de playa de arena que se puede perder, la zona más afectada sería Australia, con casi 12.000 kilómetros en peligro, mientras países como Canadá, Chile, México, China y Estados Unidos también se verían «muy afectados», dice el estudio. El riesgo por erosión es especialmente alto en Gambia y Guinea-Bissau, donde más del 60 % de la zona costera de arena puede perderse. Los efectos también serán importantes en los pequeños estados isleños, lo que supone además el riesgo de la pérdida de las culturas de esos países, agrega el experto de la Universidad de Cádiz.

(AP) \" It began as a stunning light show on a mid-August weekend \" lightning bolts crackling in the skies over Northern and Central California, touching down in grasslands and vineyards.  The National Weather Service warned that the dry lightning striking a parched landscape 'could lead to new wildfire.'  It turned out to be a huge understatement. Thousands of bolts ignited hundreds of fires in California and at least one in Oregon, setting the stage for some of the most destructive wildfires the West Coast states have seen in modern times.  One month later, firefighters are still battling them, and at least 34 people have died in California, Oregon and Washington.  'What really was jaw dropping for people was the fact that this really changed the paradigm that people have in terms of their sense of security,' said Oregon Department of Forestry spokesman Jim Gersbach. 'These burned so close to populated areas, driven by this wind \" basically unstoppable.'  The massive wildfires renewed a longstanding debate over whether climate change or a lack of aggressive forest management played the bigger role this time around. Numerous studies have found that a warming Earth, which leads to higher temperatures and drier landscape, increases the likelihood of extreme events and contributes to their severity. But many experts have also argued that more needs to be done to thin forests and reduce debris so that flames have less fuel.  Before the cluster of lightning strikes, the West's fire season had been slightly more severe than normal. In Oregon, officials had decided to not let fires grow, ordering that even small blazes be smothered quickly by aircraft, so throngs of firefighters wouldn't be needed and potentially spread the coronavirus, Gersbach said.  But then came the weekend of Aug. 15-16.  'It's been a pretty insane 12 hours across the Bay Area,' the National Weather Service forecasters reported, after the lightning storm during which white-hot bolts licked at the span of San Francisco's landmark Bay Bridge.  But that was just Act I.  Act II came three weeks later, when another freak weather phenomenon occurred.  A vast high-pressure zone stretching from Alaska to the desert in the Southwest gave Denver a summer snowfall while pushing warm, dry winds toward the Pacific coast, said Greg Jones, a professor and research climatologist at Linfield University in McMinnville, Oregon. Normally, the winds that time of year go in the opposite direction.  Those gusts pushed the fires through trees and brush that had been drying out all summer, causing the blazes to explode in size and sending them rushing into towns and rural homes. Many residents barely had time to flee with just the clothes on their back.  Jones called the weather conditions 'likely a once in a generation event.'  For the first time ever, five megafires \" defined as covering at least 100,000 acres (405 square kilometers \" were ablaze simultaneously in Oregon last week.  Smoke covered the West Coast states, creating some of the most hazardous air quality in the world. Seattle's iconic Space Needle was all but hidden in brown haze, topped with an American flag that drooped as if in surrender. The smoke stretched clear across the continent and even blew over parts of Europe.  Armies of firefighters responded. Clad in orange fire-resistant suits and helmets and carrying Pulaski hand tools, they trudged across blackened earth toward the flames. National Guard troops joined the effort. Even local residents tried to save homes by gouging firelines by hand and with excavators and bulldozers.  'You gotta pull together in times like this because it's like a war zone out here,' Kerry Kuenzi, an area resident who with several dozen others fought a monster fire in the community of Scotts Mills, Oregon, told The Oregonian/OregonLive.  The Beachie Creek Fire he faced covered less than a square mile (2 square kilometers) on Sept. 7. Overnight, driven by high winds and extremely dry fuels, it grew to 205 square miles (530 square kilometers), fire managers said.  New fires continued to ignite in California and Oregon. One burned near Interstate 5 in Oregon not far from the California state line, turning most of the towns of Phoenix and Talent into a blackened landscape littered with the twisted remains of mobile homes and other structures.  The flames were so intense that firefighters sometimes had to retreat, including those facing a blaze threatening Portland's southeastern suburbs.  'You can't really stand there with a hose when you've got 30-mile-an-hour winds and dry fuels,' Gersbach said.  Firefighters from across the nation and Canada have descended on the region to help fight the blazes: There are more than 17,000 in California fighting over two dozen major fires, and more than 6,000 facing about a dozen blazes in Oregon.  About 5,300 square miles (13,700 square kilometers) have burned this year in California \" more than ever before, Cal Fire said. In Oregon, the figure is about 1,560 square miles (4,000 square kilometers), nearly double the 10-year average.  Residents are desperately hoping for rain to wash away the choking wildfire smoke. Predicted rains in fire-hit parts of Oregon haven't arrived yet. California remains dry, though calming winds and lower temperatures \" caused in part by the smoke blotting out the sun \" have aided firefighters. Small amounts of rain are in the forecast for far northern California and the Sierra Nevada.  More than 38,000 people are still not able to return home in California, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday. Some 4,000 people remain in shelters in Oregon, according to the American Red Cross.  Some no longer have homes to return to. About 1,600 homes were destroyed in Oregon, the state Office of Emergency Management said, and 4,200 structures burned in California.  For some of those whose homes have survived, it's too dangerous to return.  With the fire season not yet over, residents are praying for a respite before the next batch of large wildfires.   ___  Associated Press writers John Antczak in Los Angeles; Sara Cline in Salem, Oregon; and Gillian Flaccus in Portland contributed.   ___  Follow Andrew Selsky on Twitter: https://twitter.com/andrewselsky  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 10, "positive": 19, "negative": 5, "disgust": 4, "joy": 3, "anger": 16, "fear": 15, "trust": 5}, "metadata": ["lightning", "northern", "fires", "california", "wildfires", "firefighters", "battling", "climate", "aggressive", "studies", "warming", "drier", "flames", "san", "landmark", "pushing", "professor", "university", "causing", "acres", "american", "canada", "forecast", "gavin", "newsom", "___", "john", "los"]}, {"text": "Jacinda Ardern has called for more action on climate change during the first televised debate before the New Zealand election on 17 October.

We have to grasp this opportunity, use it to create jobs, but also invest in the problems we already had. Inequality - let's put food in schools. Housing - let's build more public housing. That's the plan.\"  Ms Collins criticised the Labour leader's words as \"nonsense\".  During the debate, Ms Ardern and Ms Collins faced off over a range of other issues including tax cuts, borders, inequality and farmers.  The centre-right National party is promising a temporary tax cut worth around $AU2770 to average full-time wage earners.  Ms Ardern, promising a mild tax raise to the top two per cent of Kiwi income earners, said she \"shouldn't get a tax cut right now\".  \"Now is not the time to have huge uncertainty around tax policy,\" she said.  Ms Ardern closed the debate with her central pledge for stability during the pandemic.  \"It's been a really tough time for New Zealand.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) Andrew Harnik  Joe Biden accepted the Democratic presidential nomination with a vow to be a unifying “ally of the light” who would move an America in crisis past the chaos of President Donald Trump’s tenure.  In his strongest remarks of the campaign, Biden spoke Thursday night both of returning the United States to its traditional leadership role in the world and of the deeply personal challenges that shaped his life. Virtually every sentence of his 22-minute speech was designed to present a sharp, yet hopeful, contrast with the Republican incumbent.  “Here and now I give you my word: If you entrust me with the presidency, I will draw on the best of us, not the worst. l’ll be an ally of the light, not the darkness,” Biden said. “Make no mistake, united we can and will overcome this season of darkness in America.”  For the 77-year-old Biden, the final night of the Democratic National Convention was bittersweet. He accepted a nomination that had eluded him for over three decades because of personal tragedy, political stumbles and rivals who proved more dynamic.  But the coronavirus denied him the typical celebration, complete with the customary balloon drop that both parties often use to fete their new nominees. Instead, Biden spoke to a largely empty arena near his Delaware home.  Afterward, fireworks lit the sky outside the arena, where supporters waited in a parking lot, honking horns and flashing headlights in a moment that finally lent a jovial feel to the event.  The keynote address was the speech of a lifetime for Biden, who would be the oldest president ever elected if he defeats Trump in November. Trump, who is 74, publicly doubts Biden’s mental capacity and calls him “Slow Joe,” but with the nation watching, Biden was firm and clear.  Still, the convention leaned on a younger generation earlier in the night to help energize his sprawling coalition.  Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois senator who lost her legs in Iraq and is raising two young children, said Biden has “common decency.”  Cory Booker, only the ninth African American senator in U.S. history, said Biden believes in the dignity of all working Americans.  And Pete Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former South Bend, Indiana, mayor and a gay military veteran, noted that Biden came out in favor of same-sex marriage as vice president even before President Barack Obama.  “Joe Biden is right, this is a contest for the soul of the nation. And to me that contest is not between good Americans and evil Americans,” Buttigieg said. “It’s the struggle to call out what is good for every American.”  Above all, Biden focused on uniting the nation as Americans grapple with the long and fearful health crisis, the related economic devastation, a national awakening on racial justice — and Trump, who stirs heated emotions from all sides.  Biden’s positive focus Thursday night marked a break from the dire warnings offered by Obama and others the night before. The 44th president of the United States warned that American democracy itself could falter if Trump is reelected, while Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris, the 55-year-old California senator and daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, warned that Americans’ lives and livelihoods were at risk.  Biden’s Democratic Party has sought this week to put forward a cohesive vision of values and policy priorities, highlighting efforts to combat climate change, tighten gun laws and embrace a humane immigration policy. They have drawn a sharp contrast with Trump’s policies and personality, portraying him as cruel, self-centered and woefully unprepared to manage virtually any of the nation’s mounting crises and policy challenges.  Vice President Mike Pence, interviewed Friday on several morning talk shows, criticized Democrats as presenting “a very grim picture of the United States” and said the Republican National Convention next week will focus on what Trump has accomplished, including on the economy and with his coronavirus response.  Voting was another prime focus of the convention on Thursday as it has been all week. Democrats fear that the pandemic – and Trump administration changes at the U.S. Postal Service – may make it difficult for voters to cast ballots in person or by mail.  Comedian Sarah Cooper, a favorite of many Democrats for her videos lip syncing Trump’s speeches, put it bluntly: “Donald Trump doesn’t want any of us to vote because he knows he can’t win fair and square.”  Biden’s call for unity comes as some strategists worry that Democrats cannot retake the White House simply by tearing Trump down, that Biden needs to give his sprawling coalition something to vote for. That’s easier said than done in a modern Democratic Party made up of disparate factions that span generation, race and ideology.  Though he has been in the public spotlight for decades as a Delaware senator, much of the electorate knows little about Biden’s background before he began serving as Obama’s vice president in 2008.  Thursday’s convention served as a national reintroduction of sorts that drew on some of the most painful moments of his life.  “I know how mean and cruel and unfair life can be sometimes,” Biden said. He added: “I found the best way through pain and loss and grief is to find purpose.”  As a schoolboy, Biden was mocked by classmates and a nun for a severe stutter. He became a widower at just 30 after losing his wife and infant daughter to a car accident. And just five years ago, he buried his eldest son, who was stricken by cancer.  From such hardship, Biden developed a deep sense of empathy that has defined much of his political career. And throughout the convention, Biden’s allies testified that such empathy, backed by decades of governing experience, makes him the perfect candidate to guide the nation back from mounting health and economic crises.  His allies Thursday included Brayden Harrington, a 13-year-old boy from Concord, New Hampshire. The boy said he and Biden were “members of the same club,” each with a stutter they’re working to overcome.  He noted that Biden told him about a book of poems he liked to read aloud to practice his speech and showed the boy how he marks his speeches so they’re easier to read aloud.  “I’m just a regular kid, and in a short amount of time, Joe Biden made me more confident about a thing that’s bothered me my whole life,” Harrington said.  The end of the carefully scripted convention now gives way to a far less-predictable period for Biden and his Democratic Party as the 2020 election season speeds to its uncertain conclusion. While Election Day isn’t until Nov. 3, early voting gets underway in several battleground states in just one month.  Biden has maintained a polling advantage over Trump for much of the year, but it remains to be seen whether the Democratic nominee’s approach to politics and policy will genuinely excite the coalition he’s courting in an era of uncompromising partisanship.  Biden summed up his view of the campaign: “We choose a path of becoming angry, less hopeful and more divided, a path of shadow and suspicion, or we can choose a different path and together take this chance to heal.”   ___  Peoples reported from New York.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wanted President Barack Obama to sweat.  As Obama geared up for a difficult 2012 reelection bid, the democratic socialist senator encouraged a progressive Democrat to step forward to challenge Obama in the primaries and push the Democratic debate to the left, though Sanders was adamant he would not be that candidate.  \"I'm not a Democrat. I'm an independent. But if a progressive Democrat wants to run, I think it would enliven the debate, raise some issues and people have a right to do that,\" Sanders told WNYC in March 2011. \"I've been asked whether I am going to do that. I'm not. I don't know who is, but in a democracy, it's not a bad idea to have different voices out there.\"  By late 2011, it was clear that no such challenger would mount a campaign, but Sanders had yet to formally lend his support to Obama's reelection bid. \"I certainly hope and expect to be supporting the president, but it's a little bit early in the process,\" Sanders told Politico in November of that year.  Explaining his reticence toward Obama, Sanders voiced concerns that the president would impose cuts to programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and called on Obama to hike taxes on the wealthy and \"stop reaching negotiated agreements with Republicans that are extremely weak and disadvantageous to ordinary people.\"  But that was then. Four years later, the senator who cited his independent affiliation as a reason he wouldn't seek the Democratic nomination has undergone an about-face on the merits of working within the party. (Though Sanders has always caucused with the Democrats in the Senate, he no longer touts his independent status, telling ABC News last fall, \"I am a Democrat now.\") As Sanders closes the gap with Hillary Clinton in national and early-state polls, he's also sounding a strikingly different tune about the president he's vying to succeed.   Getty Images  A newfound appreciation: While Sanders is running a campaign that taps into dissatisfaction with Obama's America — decrying persistent wealth inequality, slamming administration-backed free trade agreements and pointing to stubbornly high unemployment levels among demographic groups like African-Americans and Hispanics — Sanders is now far more laudatory in assessing the Obama record than he was four years ago. (Since then, Obama has signed tax increases on wealthy Americans and adopted an increasingly confrontational posture toward Republicans, as Sanders had hoped.)  After Obama delivered his final State of the Union address on Tuesday night, Sanders had nary a word of criticism for the president.  \"President Obama raised some enormously important points regarding the long-term future of our country — much I agreed with. Not only can we effectively combat climate change, we can create good-paying jobs. Yes, we have to destroy ISIS, but we must do so through a coalition, and we cannot get bogged down in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East,\" Sanders said in a statement. \"I also appreciated the president's point that we need more civil politics, that we need to get big money out of politics and that at a time of tremendous wealth and income inequality we must revitalize American democracy.\"  Implicitly linking his call for a \"political revolution\" to Obama's address, Sanders tweeted Tuesday night that the speech also served as a reminder \"not to be afraid of change\":  Sanders' warm words for the president's speech followed several months of concerted efforts to make clear to Democratic voters that despite often-sharp differences in both style and substance, the senator sees the Obama legacy as, on balance, a commendable one.  In his \"I am a Democrat\" interview with ABC this fall, Sanders pushed back against the suggestion that he'd been disloyal to the president, who campaigned for Sanders during his 2006 Senate election.  \"The idea that I've worked against Barack Obama is categorically false,\" Sanders said. He added, \"I think under incredible Republican obstructionism, Obama and Joe Biden have moved this country forward in a way that leaves us a hell of a lot better than when [President George W.] Bush was in office.\"  Why the shift? If Sanders hopes to become the Democratic standard-bearer in the fall, he must walk a fine line between trumpeting the anti-establishment message that's won him legions of progressive fans and paying homage to an establishment president who remains overwhelmingly popular with the Democratic electorate.  A New York Times/CBS News poll released this week found that Obama boasts an 81% approval rating among Democrats, with just 13% disapproving. Beset with a looming financial crash and lingering discontent over the Iraq War, President George W. Bush entered his final State of the Union address in 2008 in a weaker position among Republicans: While 62% of GOPers told the Pew Research Center that Bush would be remembered for his accomplishments, no fewer than 27% of his fellow partisans thought he'd go down in history for his failures.  Obama remains especially popular with nonwhites, a key segment of the Democratic coalition with whom Sanders is looking to make inroads. A CNN/ORC International poll last month found that while 47% of Americans overall approved of Obama's job performance, 70% of nonwhites did.  African-Americans and Hispanics have been among the biggest beneficiaries of Obama's landmark health care reform law, an Enroll America analysis featured in the New York Times found. Pew also found that blacks and Hispanics are the strongest supporters of new gun control measures.  How it plays: As Sanders nips at Clinton's heels in the latest polling, her campaign is slamming Sanders on both issues, saying his single-payer health care plan would dismantle Obama's Affordable Care Act (Sanders voted for the law, but as his plan attests, wants to go further) and hotly disputing the Sanders campaign's claim that there's \"no daylight\" between Sanders and Obama on guns. (While Sanders strongly backs Obama's recent executive action on background checks, he voted to give gun manufacturers immunity from lawsuits, a policy Obama opposes.)  While the administration's recent focus on gun violence has posed an awkward problem for Sanders and provided ammunition for Clinton, don't look for Obama to put his thumb on the scale in the Democratic primary. The White House announced this week that there will be no endorsement from the president until Democrats pick their nominee.  In a major boost to Sanders' campaign, the senator received an eyebrow-raising assist this week from Vice President Joe Biden, who opted this fall not to mount a White House campaign of his own. Praising Sanders' career-long advocacy for greater income equality, Biden pointedly called Clinton a newcomer to that fight in a CNN interview, while also disputing the notion that Sanders is weak on gun safety issues.  \"What Bernie Sanders has to do is say that the Second Amendment says — which he has, of late — the Second Amendment says you can limit who can own a gun, that people who are criminals shouldn't have guns,\" Biden said. \"People who are schizophrenic and have mental illnesses shouldn't own guns. And he has said that.\"  Much as they created a headache for the Clinton camp, Biden's comments weren't quite an endorsement of Sanders. But as the progressive insurgent looks to draw Obama voters into his campaign, Biden provided a healthy dose of much-needed adrenaline.

Three of them make immediate sense against the backdrop of our current emergency: stockpile masks and respirators; have testing infrastructure ready; and ban the global wildlife trade, including the open animal markets where COVID-19 may have first infected people.  His fourth recommendation is both the most grandiose and the least sensible to talk about in the midst of a once-in-a-century crisis: “Take care of nature.”  The assault on ecosystems that allowed COVID-19 to jump from animals to humans went far beyond merchants hunting and selling rare wildlife. Biodiversity — that is, the health of the entire ecosystem — can restrain pathogens before they ever leave the wild. “We need to tell people right now that there is a series of things we need to do once we’re out of this mess to make sure it never happens again,” Hannah says.  The role of biodiversity in disease prevention has received increased attention of late. In a 2015 “state of knowledge review” of biodiversity and human health by the United Nations, scientists wrote that “an ecological approach to disease, rather than a simplistic ‘one germ, one disease’ approach, will provide a richer understanding of disease-related outcomes.” Recent research has given more support to the idea that biodiversity protection in one part of the world can prevent novel diseases from emerging and leaping into another.  It’s a numbers game, in part. Not all species in a community are equally susceptible to a given disease, nor are they all equally efficient transmitters. In diverse ecosystems well separated from human habitations, viruses ebb and flow without ever having a chance to make it to the big time.  But as people move in, those protections begin to break down. Disrupted ecosystems tend to lose their biggest predators first, and what they leave behind are smaller critters that live fast, reproduce in large numbers, and have immune systems more capable of carrying disease without succumbing to it. When there are only a few species left, they’re good at carrying disease, and they thrive near people, there may be nothing between a deadly pathogen and all of humanity.  “Virus spillover risk” from wildlife to people rises as contact increases between them, according to research published Tuesday by a team of researchers led by Christine Kreuder Johnson of the One Health Institute at University of California, Davis. Almost half of the new diseases that jumped from animals to humans (called zoonotic pathogens) after 1940 can be traced to changes in land use, agriculture, or wildlife hunting. SARS, Ebola, West Nile, Lyme, MERS, and others all fit the profile. There may be 10,000 mammalian viruses potentially dangerous to people.  “We are messing with natural systems in certain ways that can make them much more dangerous than they would otherwise be,” says Richard Ostfeld, a disease ecologist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies. “And biodiversity loss is one of those. Climate change is another.”  A longer-term strategy can help nations see the benefits of rethinking resource use. “The revenue from clearing new forest is extremely high — briefly,” says William Karesh, executive vice president at EcoHealth Alliance, a research non-profit. “But the cost to the public-health system also goes up because you get very common diseases like malaria.” And as we’re now seeing, new zoonotic pathogens can be even more expensive to deal with.  Despite years of creative and resource-intensive work by governments and non-profits, companies’ actions to mitigate habitat loss aren’t adding up. Many large companies have pledged to halt deforestation, the largest driver of biodiversity loss, through initiatives like the Consumer Goods Forum, the Banking Environment Initiative and their Soft Commodities Compact. “All have missed the mark,” according to a new report by the Rainforest Action Network.  Hannah, of Conservation International, is working to make sure that the reasons to promote biodiversity, including its pathogen-dulling potential, align with the other endangered elephant in the room: climate change.  In February, Hannah and colleagues announced findings on what the effects of achieving climate and conservation targets might be. Using data on 290,000 species, they were able to squint into the future and see where ecosystems might be saved from mass extinction if nations preserve 30 per cent of natural habitats and meet UN limits for global warming. All told, meeting the goals would cut biodiversity losses in half.  The international community is positioned to make some progress. The Convention on Biological Diversity is a 196-nation effort to protect the richness of living things, tap natural resources sustainably, and share the benefits of the environment’s naturally occurring genetic innovations. (The U.S. and the Vatican are non-members.) The next phase of the biodiversity treaty, currently in draft form, proposes that at least 30 per cent of land and ocean be conserved, up from 17 per cent in the previous round. If governments agree to that goal, then nations and conservation scientists must take on the complicated step of figuring out which 30 per cent is most important to protect and how to do it.  Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...  The way those areas are drawn today rarely reflects the scientific ideal of how to guard biodiversity. Looking at the existing protected lands, a paper in Nature last month found that 90 per cent of conservation space fails to give bird, amphibian and mammal species the full range of environmental conditions across their existing habitats.  “We could be doing a much better job of getting things in the right places,” says Hannah. “There’s going to be right places for disease control and they may largely overlap the right places for biodiversity.”   Read more about:  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 13, "positive": 36, "negative": 7, "disgust": 1, "joy": 3, "anger": 11, "surprise": 2, "fear": 7, "trust": 6}, "metadata": ["pandemic", "infrastructure", "ban", "global", "assault", "ecosystems", "humans", "united", "scientists", "ecological", "diseases", "immune", "deadly", "researchers", "christine", "johnson", "university", "climate", "nations", "mitigate", "habitat", "initiatives", "rainforest", "targets", "extinction", "convention", "diversity", "proposes", "scientific", "environmental"]}, {"text": "WASHINGTON — Competent, a fighter, good. Old, out of touch, disingenuous. And, of course: who's that?  As the 2020 campaign intensifies, a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research asked Americans to say what word or phrase comes to mind when they think of the top candidates, including incumbent President Donald Trump.  Each received both positive and negative responses; In some cases, a sizable share didn't know enough about the candidate to give a description.  Here's a look at how Americans characterized the contenders:   BIDEN  Many Americans think of the former vice president's job when asked about Joe Biden, but one response ranked above all others: He's \"old.\" Sixteen percent of those thinking of a phrase to describe Biden mention his age, including comparable shares of Democrats and Republicans.  One 34-year-old Democrat said he is \"living in the past,\" and others called him \"past his prime.\"  About 1 in 10 either identify him as former vice president or think of former President Barack Obama. Biden has spent much of the campaign drawing on his connection to the first African American president.  Another 5% criticize his intellect or speaking skills, like calling him \"bumbling,\" as one 78-year-old did, or mentioning gaffes.  Still, about 2 in 10 speak fondly of Biden, including many saying he is experienced or \"good.\"  \"Kind heart. Good man,\" said one 41-year-old man.   BLOOMBERG  The billionaire is known for just that: About 3 in 10 of those describing former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg mentioned his wealth, or suggested he was buying the election. Many simply said \"money\" or \"rich.\" A 62-year-old Democrat described him as \"buying votes.\"  Some others described Bloomberg as dishonest, calling him names like \"liar.\"  Still, close to 2 in 10 Democrats included positive words on Bloomberg, including \"action oriented,\" and \"intelligent.\"   BUTTIGIEG  Pete Buttigieg sees more variation in the types of words people use to describe him. About 1 in 10 call out his age, saying he's \"young.\" Roughly another 1 in 10 mention that he's smart and a similar share call him inexperienced. The 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, entered the contest distinguishing himself from his septuagenarian rivals, and advocating for Democrats to turn the page.  \"Capable but inexperienced,\" said one 73-year-old Democrat.  Another Democrat considered his age a benefit, not a flaw: \"Young and new ideas,\" the 40-year-old said.  Also distinguishing Buttigieg: He would be the first openly gay U.S. president. About 1 in 10 mention his sexual orientation.  Overall, about 4 in 10 Americans don't have something to say about Buttigieg.   KLOBUCHAR  Amy Klobuchar is a moderate, a midwesterner and among those running to be the first woman president of the United States. While those who describe her think of these and more, none stands above the others.  No single response is used by more than 6% of those describing the Minnesota senator. About half of Americans, including about 4 in 10 Democrats, don't give a description.  Among Democrats, 1 in 10 think of her intellect, calling her \"smart,\" and 6% mention her centrist ideology and \"pragmatism.\" Some give negative reactions, including a few saying she is \"mean to her staff\" — a widely reported news story early in the campaign. Others just called her \"ok.\"  But more are generally positive, using words like \"reasonable,\" \"strong\" and \"sincere.\"  \"Rational and experienced,\" said one Democrat, 67.   SANDERS  About a quarter name liberalism, socialism or communism when asked to think about Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator has forcefully pushed the Democratic Party left with grassroots campaigns in both 2016 and 2020, calling for overhauls to health care, Wall Street and higher education. While Republicans are especially likely to mention ideology, nearly 1 in 10 Democrats do, too.  Some call him \"crazy.\" Like Biden, Sanders also gets knocked for his age, with roughly 1 in 10 calling him \"old.\"  \"Too extreme and too old\" said one Democrat, 55.  But among Democrats, many describe Sanders as \"smart,\" \"great\" or \"honest,\" or make references to health care policy.  \"Leader of the future,\" offered a 28-year-old Democrat. Another Democrat, 62, called him a \"warrior for the people.\"   STEYER  Like Bloomberg, Tom Steyer is known for being \"rich,\" with wealth mentioned by 14% of those who volunteer a word to describe him.  One 30-year-old Democrat says he is \"trying to buy the election.\"  About 1 in 10 point out the businessman's first foray into politics, such as saying he is \"inexperienced\" or \"unknown.\" Overall, about half of Americans don't know enough to give a reaction to Steyer.  Another Democrat, 72, focused not on his wealth but on his chances: \"Down to earth but not up to challenge.\"  Five percent of Democrats mention climate change, an issue he has championed.   WARREN  Americans don't coalesce around one way of describing Elizabeth Warren. A sizeable share think of \"dishonest\" and \"lies\" — descriptions that are concentrated heavily among Republicans. Five percent of those describing her mention her left-leaning politics. Similar percentages call her \"smart\" or \"strong.\"  Among Democrats, descriptions focus on strength, a willingness to fight and competence.  \"Intelligent and well-seasoned,\" says one Democrat, 45.  \"She has a plan!\" says another, 60, referencing the early-adopted mantra of the Massachusetts senator's campaign.   TRUMP  As is the case for most measures of the president, the words offered to describe him are deeply partisan.  Close to 2 in 10 Republicans describe Trump's leadership or his presidency. Others called him \"good\" or \"honest.\" Trump faces almost no challenge for the Republican nomination, and responses suggest that's just fine with his supporters.  \"Greatest president ever,\" said one Republican, 63. Many volunteered Trump's 2016 campaign slogan: MAGA. A 68-year-old woman called him a \"great leader.\"  Still, some Republicans went negative, including calling him \"arrogant\" or a \"liar.\"  Meanwhile, Democrats volunteered those and many other negative words in reaction to the president. Many labeled him \"evil,\" \"racist,\" \"corrupt\" and a \"bully.\"  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 7, "positive": 26, "negative": 4, "disgust": 1, "joy": 2, "anger": 10, "surprise": 2, "fear": 1, "trust": 3}, "metadata": ["washington", "campaign", "poll", "donald", "biden", "joe", "american", "calling", "bloomberg", "billionaire", "mayor", "buttigieg", "united", "sanders", "bernie", "vermont", "democratic", "republicans", "steyer", "wealth", "focused", "climate", "warren", "elizabeth", "willingness", "massachusetts", "trump"]}, {"text": "WAUKESHA, Wis. (AP) \" President Donald Trump assured supporters packed shoulder to shoulder at a trio of rallies Saturday that 'we're rounding the turn' on the coronavirus and mocked challenger Joe Biden for raising alarms about the pandemic, despite surging cases around the country and more positive infections at the White House.  Trump's remarks came hours before the White House announced that a top aide to Vice President Mike Pence had tested positive for the virus. Pence has been in close contact with the adviser, the White House said, but still planned to keep traveling and holding rallies around the country.  The revelation of another high-ranking administration official testing positive for the virus coupled with the administration's decision to continue business as usual punctuated a day that was marked the starkly different approaches that Trump and Biden are taking to campaigning in the age of the novel coronavirus.  Pence's office confirmed late Saturday that his chief of staff, Marc Short, had tested positive \" the public announcement coming just as Trump was wrapping up a day of big rallies in North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin, three battleground states that will have enormous impact on deciding the Nov. 3 election.  Pence is considered a 'close contact' under Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, but will continue to campaign, his spokesman said. 'In consultation with the White House Medical Unit, the Vice President will maintain his schedule in accordance with the CDC guidelines for essential personnel,\" Pence spokesman Devin O'Malley said.  O'Malley added that Pence and his wife, Karen Pence, both tested negative for the virus on Saturday 'and remain in good health.' Pence, who held campaign events in Florida on Saturday, is set to campaign in North Carolina on Sunday.  The revelation bookended a day in which Biden and Trump demonstrated remarkably different attitudes about what they saw as safe behavior in the homestretch of a campaign that, as with all aspects of American life, has been upended by the pandemic.  \"We don't want to become superspreaders,' Biden told supporters at a 'drive-in\" rally Saturday in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, picking up a term that has been used to describe the Rose Garden event in late September in which Trump announced his latest Supreme Court nominee. More than two dozen people linked to the White House have contracted COVID-19 since that gathering, as have campaign aides. Trump spent more than three days hospitalized at Walter Reed Military Medical Center after becoming stricken.  Biden pressed his case that Trump was showing dangerous indifference to the surging virus on a day he looked to boost his candidacy with the star power of rock legend Jon Bon Jovi, who performed before Biden took the stage at a second drive-in rally in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.  Meanwhile, in Lumberton, North Carolina, his tongue firmly in cheek, Trump called Biden 'an inspiring guy\" for raising alarm about the pandemic. The president said that he watched Biden's Bucks County rally as he flew to North Carolina and sarcastically observed that it appeared attendees, who were in their cars, weren't properly socially distancing.  Trump at his rallies repeatedly criticized the news media for focusing on the virus, which has killed about 224,000 people in the United States and more than 1 million across the globe.  'It's always cases, cases, cases. They don't talk about deaths,' Trump complained to a crowd of several thousand at an outdoor rally in Circleville Ohio, where few wore masks even as they stood and sat shoulder to shoulder. 'They're trying to scare everybody,' he said.  Earlier, at a rally in North Carolina, Trump questioned the value of testing, taking a stance in opposition to public health experts across the globe.  'You know why we have cases?' Trump asked. ''Cause we test so much. And in many ways, it's good. And in many ways, it's foolish. In many ways, OK? In many ways it's very foolish.'  The rise in coronavirus cases is an ominous sign the disease still has a firm grip on the nation that has more confirmed virus-related deaths and infections than any other in the world. Many states say hospitals are running out of space in areas where the pandemic seemed remote only months ago. And in addition to the spike in cases, in many parts of the country, the percentage of people who are testing positive for COVID-19 is up as well.  Trump went further, pushing a conspiracy theory that hospitals are over-classifying coronavirus deaths because 'doctors get more money and hospitals get more money' \" even though there is no evidence of that and experts say the count is likely under-reported.  The U.S. and its reporting systems, 'are really not doing it right,' he claimed. 'They have things a little bit backwards.\"  As he dug in on his defense on the panic, Trump also criticized Biden for saying that the country was headed for a 'dark winter' because of the pandemic \" the scenario of a surge in infections that health experts have warned about for months.  'I thought Sleepy Joe was very dark,\" he told his biggest crowd of the day at a night-time rally in Waukesha, Wisconsin. 'How dark was that? How horrible was that?' he asked.  A record of more than 83,000 infections were reported on Friday alone.  Biden in his stop in Luzerne reminded supporters that Trump had suggested the COVID-19 mortality rate was lower outside predominantly Democratic states.  'Where does this guy come from?\" Biden said.  The president has repeatedly accused Biden and other Democrats of pushing measures that are worse than the coronavirus itself by advocating for social distancing and limits on gatherings that Trump says wreak havoc on the economy.  Biden, in an interview with Pod Save America aired Saturday, said his first priority was to 'get control of the virus\" because the economy can't move forward without stemming the disease.  \"As I said before, I will shut down the virus, not the economy,\" Biden said in Bucks County. 'We can walk and chew gum at the same time, and build back better than before.\"  Trump, who spent Friday night at his private Mar-a-Lago club after campaigning in Florida, visited an early voting polling site set up at a local public library to cast his own ballot Saturday morning. The president last year switched his official residence from New York to Florida, complaining that New York politicians had treated him badly.  Greeted at the polling site by a crowd of cheering supporters, Trump opted to vote in person rather than by mail. He wore a mask inside, following local rules to mitigate the spread of the virus. He later said that he voted for 'a guy named Trump\" and that a poll worker asked him identification. The president said he used his passport.  Biden hasn't voted but is likely do so in person on Election Day, Nov. 3, as Delaware doesn't offer early voting. Trump, who has made unsubstantiated claims of massive fraud about mail-in voting, gave another plug to in-person voting.  'When you send in your ballot it could never be like that. It could never be secure like that,\" Trump said.   ___  Weissert reported from Dallas, Pennsylvania, and Madhani from Washington.

In a way, it’s as though we’ve been preparing for this eventuality for decades. Pop culture is America’s subconscious, and ours has been dreaming apocalyptic dreams.  The latest fictional dystopia is also an old one. This week sees the publication of Suzanne Collins’s The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, a prequel to her wildly successful Hunger Games trilogy about a dystopian world in which children are forced to battle to the death on reality TV. The new book is billed as an origin story for Coriolanus Snow, the future president of Panem and the chief villain of the original trilogy. And it fulfills that function capably enough, although it fails to ever quite reach the adrenaline-pumping urgency of the first trilogy.  But more pressingly, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is an origin story for the Hunger Games themselves. It tells us how and why they came to be in the first place.  The Hunger Games are all about bread and circuses. The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes reveals the origin of the circus part.  The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes begins with the 10th Hunger Games, 64 years before Katniss Everdeen will volunteer for the Games that kick off the central trilogy. And at this point, the Games are comparatively minimalist.  Rating: 3.5 out of 5 vox-mark vox-mark vox-mark vox-mark vox-mark  The Games still, at this early stage, feature 24 children, a.k.a. tributes — two from each of the 12 impoverished districts that rebelled against the wealthy Capitol of Panem — who are thrown into an arena with a handful of weapons and forced to fight to their televised deaths. But as we enter the story, the arena isn’t the vast and ever-shifting outdoor landscape that Collins put to such memorable use in the first trilogy. (Collins has never been strong on prose, but she’s fantastic at setting. I’ll never forget the choking wilderness of the forest from The Hunger Games, or the eerie clock-shaped arena of Catching Fire.)  In The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, the arena is a literal arena. It’s a sports stadium, and the luckless tributes try to hide from each other in the stands.  The cameras haven’t yet begun to follow the tributes from place to place to pick up every juicy minute of the Games. There aren’t even many microphones, so that when one tribute happens to fall and break his leg next to a mic, the watching audience is startled by crack of his bones. They haven’t heard any of the previous carnage.  But not that many people enjoy watching the Games yet, even within the Capitol. They don’t doubt their necessity — the war between districts and Capitol is only 10 years gone, and everyone remembers the deprivation and the horror of the violence and is eager for it to be avenged on their enemies — but they find the Games dull. They don’t particularly care for the tributes or whether they live or die. For Capitol citizens, there’s really nothing that interesting about watching a bunch of impoverished children hack each other to bits and/or starve to death.  To pep up the proceedings in this 10th year, 24 students from the Academy — a high school for the children of the Capitol elite — will be guiding the tributes as mentors. The idea is that they can help inject some fresh interest, under the symbolic guise of unity between the Capitol and districts. And among those 24 elite students is 18-year-old Coriolanus Snow, future villain.  At 18, however, Coriolanus is nothing but a striver, networking and brown-nosing with abandon. The Snows lost everything in the war except for their old family name and reputation, and Coriolanus plans to redeem it with the splendor of his achievements. The mentorship program will be the first step in a series of professional glories for him: He’ll guide his tribute to victory, be awarded a scholarship to study at the university, and then embark on a career in politics that will culminate in his presidency. He’ll restore honor to his family name. His aging grandmother and his beloved cousin Tigris (old fans will remember her from Mockingjay) will be able to lead lives of comfort and ease.  So it puts a major hitch in Coriolanus’s plans to find himself saddled with the girl from District Twelve as his tribute, Lucy Gray. She’s from the poorest district, and undernourished, which makes her unlikely to win. That means trouble for Coriolanus.  But after all, Coriolanus reasons, pulling an unlikely win out of a dark horse contestant will just make him a more attractive figure to all the career politicians who care about the Games. And even if Lucy Gray isn’t particularly strong or deadly, she has personality. She’s a performer who wows the crowd at her reaping by singing a folk song to the watching audience. People find her charming. Even Coriolanus does.  Gently, Coriolanus begins to pitch ideas to the Gamemakers that work to Lucy Gray’s advantage. What if the audience got to know the tributes better through interviews, so that they’d have a reason to care about the fights? What if viewers could bet on tributes, to give them a rooting interest? What if they could sponsor their tribute of choice?  And so we watch the Games become a spectacle, because it suits Coriolanus’s purposes, and because his bosses agree that it’s an effective way of getting the Capitol citizens more invested in the fights. But it takes much longer to understand why the Games exist in the first place.  The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is less interested in political allegory than it is in political philosophy  The original Hunger Games trilogy was part action series, part political allegory. In those books, the government forced children to kill each other with spectacle because that is what we do in real life to our children, under our present government. Collins came up with the idea for the series while flipping back and forth between Iraq War footage and episodes of a reality TV talent show. The series became a motif during the Ferguson protests against the police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown. American culture is full of the spectacular and televised killing of teenagers, and all Collins really did in her dystopia was dial the ages down a couple of years.  The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes digs a little deeper. It’s interested not just in the fact of the murder of children, but in the why of it, and it primes the readers to begin to consider the question with epigraphs from the philosophers Hobbes and Locke and Rousseau. “Something is significantly wrong with a creature that sacrifices its children’s lives to settle its differences,” Katniss says at the end of Mockingjay. In The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, Coriolanus begins to investigate what that something is.  He’s guided in his investigation by Dr. Gaul, the menacing Head Gamemaker who keeps popping up out of nowhere to torture an animal, say something sinister, and disappear again. Gaul believes the Games are necessary to keep order in place and to prevent human beings from devolving into an animalistic state of nature. She takes a special interest in teaching Coriolanus exactly why that control is necessary, and why she believes the Games are essential to it.  This book is President Snow’s origin story. That doesn’t mean he comes off as sympathetic.  When the announcement first came that The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes would be Snow’s origin story, fans reacted with outrage. Were they really going to be asked to sympathize with a fictional fascist? Would Collins try to justify all the atrocities we knew he was going to commit by giving him a tragic past, Anakin Skywalker style?  But nothing of the sort happens in this book. Collins doesn’t even grant Coriolanus the intimacy of narrating the book in the first person, the way Katniss does in the original trilogy. Instead, we stay in Coriolanus’s head but at the slight remove of a close third person, the better to watch a stone-cold snake at work.  Coriolanus is a player from the beginning, analyzing every person he meets for their value to his prospects and then either abandoning them or relentlessly buttering them up. His tribute Lucy Gray thinks he’s a good person because he treats her like a human being, but we readers know he does so only because he thinks he’ll have a better chance of engaging the audience if he convinces them that Lucy Gray is closer to a real human being than the other district kids are. The rest of them he considers to be little better than animals.  And as Coriolanus begins to grow gradually more and more fond of Lucy Gray, Collins leaves us little space to imagine that his interest in her is in any way based on a belief in her inherent human worth.  All of this calculation and coldness makes Coriolanus a tricky protagonist. Collins has no interest in making him sympathetic or a figure to root for, but she does have to maintain the reader’s interest in him all the same. Mostly, she does that by giving Coriolanus a sense of humor. The kid’s a slimeball, but he knows tacky when he sees it, and one of the deep pleasures of this book is watching his unimpressed reactions to the sparse pageantry the Capitol has built around this early version of the Games: At one point the presenter brings in his pet parrot and, when it refuses to talk, mimes talking for it. Coriolanus, gamely thumbs-upping the camera, thinks dark thoughts.  But while Coriolanus can be compelling, he never resolves into the kind of iconic survive-at-all-costs protagonist that Katniss was. And in general, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes lacks the relentless urgency of the original trilogy.  In part, that’s because we’re not in the arena ourselves this time. We’re in the studio with the 24 Capitol kids who run the mentorship program, watching the Games with them. Thematically, that’s a strong choice that hammers home both Coriolanus’s complicity with the system and our own: If you’re reading this book, there’s a solid chance that you’re much closer to being part of the corrupt and decadent Capitol than you are to being one with the impoverished districts.  But on a storytelling level, it means we never feel the adrenaline jolt of our narrator battling for her life against insurmountable odds. We just follow our snake-like protagonist as he watches other people battle for their lives, across the slight and chilly remove of a third-person narration.  So in the end, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes isn’t quite the moment-defining achievement the original trilogy was. It’s more of a curiosity, a cold-blooded philosophical inquiry that adds depth to the original three books but is not essential reading. It’s a nightmare from which it is all too easy to wake up.

In the face of growing worldwide concern about ocean plastic pollution, the report concludes that companies are far too slow in adopting responsive actions and promoting reusability, recyclability, or compostability in their packaging, and failing to shift away from wasteful packaging, toward circular models that prioritize absolute reduction.  Out of the 50 companies in the beverage, quick-service restaurant, consumer packaged goods, and retail sectors, the highest grade was a B- for Unilever. Twelve companies received C grades, 22 received D grades, and 15 received F grades. The six lowest ranked companies by size of revenue were Walmart, Kroger, PepsiCo, Tyson Foods, Kraft Heinz, and Mondelēz International. The high number of poor and failing grades reflects a lack of basic goal setting, strategy, and planning which must be developed to effectively address the plastic pollution crisis.  Plastic production is set to quadruple by 2050, yet only 14 percent of plastic packaging is recycled globally, and just 13 percent is recycled in the U.S. Single-use packaging is a major component of the up to 12 million pounds of plastic trash swept into waterways annually, threatening marine life. Plastics greatly contribute to climate change. By 2050, greenhouse gas emissions from plastic could reach 56 gigatons, or up to 13 percent of Earth’s entire remaining carbon budget.  “Companies have an absolute responsibility to reduce plastic pollution,” said Conrad MacKerron, As You Sow’s Senior Vice President and lead author of the report. “This report shows that the consumer goods industry is failing to address single-use plastics and take financial responsibility to improve recycling. We were unable to identify leadership companies, but rather found scattered leadership actions.”  Company actions were analyzed and graded on six pillars businesses must implement to address the plastics crisis: packaging design, reusable packaging, recycled content, data disclosure, voluntary support for improving recycling systems, and mandated financial responsibility to improve those systems.

The most progress was evident in pledges to redesign packaging to be reusable, recyclable, or compostable, followed by commitments to increase recycled content and actions to support recycling. There was notably less leadership in the areas of reusable packaging innovation, data transparency, and producer responsibility. These results indicate that companies have a long way to go to transition from single-use plastics to reusable alternatives, take financial responsibility to fix the U.S. recycling system to dramatically increase recycling yields, and deliver a more circular plastics economy.  “There’s a massive amount of work to be done,” said MacKerron. “This report provides a blueprint for what companies need to do to take responsibility for their plastic waste and move us to a circular economy for consumer packaging.”   Key recommendations:  Prioritize setting goals for reducing overall plastic use and using high levels of recycled content  Match packaging design to available recycling systems so more packaging can be recycled and not landfilled  Refrain from packaging more products in flexible plastic until these materials can be recycled  Contribute up to 1 percent of annual revenue to help finance the $12 billion in infrastructure upgrade and market development needed to dramatically increase recycling yields  Prioritize long-term contracts with recycling processors to signal serious commitment to use of recycled plastic feedstock and create a circular economy for plastic packaging  To learn more about As You Sow’s work on plastic pollution, click here.

The Turnbull government had such a plan – the national energy guarantee – but its minority of climate-change deniers refused to accept it. The plan was abandoned and, pretty soon, so was Malcolm Turnbull. Of the three key objectives – security, reliability and affordability – the report rates the status of the first two as “critical” (bureaucratspeak for “a real worry”) and only the last as “moderate-critical” (“not as bad as it was”). Australians are installing solar panels at an increasing rate. Credit: To be fair, coal-fired power and renewable energy are so different in their nature that moving the power system from one to the other – and don’t doubt that this is what’s already happening – was always going to be a tricky business. That, of course, is why decent politicians would be doing all they could to minimise the uncertainty. “Security” is now “the issue of most concern” to the board. It means maintaining a consistent flow of power at the right frequency and voltage. Failure to do so can seriously damage the system and cause significant interruptions to power supply – that is, days or months, not hours.  The problem is caused by the increasing role of “variable renewable energy resources” (aka wind farms and solar farms) and “distributed energy resources” (aka rooftop solar panels and maybe batteries). Loading “Reliability” – that is, the avoidance of much shorter blackouts – is now a bigger worry than it was. It has improved since last year, but the balance between demand and supply is still very tight during the summer peak demand in Victoria, NSW and South Australia. “The increased severity of weather events, especially over summer, coincides with an ageing, and hence less dependable, coal generator fleet,” the report says. When we come to affordability, it has “improved slightly over the year for retail customers”. Considering that retail prices leapt by 80 per cent between June 2004 and June last year, I suppose you have to regard that as progress.  Why did prices go so high? Well, not for the reason Scott Morrison keeps diverting our attention to: Labor’s evil tax on carbon, which Tony Abbott soon abolished. No, the report explains that the years of soaring prices were “largely driven by overbuilt [transmission] networks in Queensland and NSW, rising wholesale fuel costs, retail market [profit-motivated] inefficiencies and the cost of a range of renewables subsidies”. Why did affordability (that is, not price per unit of power, but the size of people’s bills) improve slightly last financial year? Mainly because the average amount of energy from the grid fell as people moved to rooftop solar and also used electricity more efficiently – say, by buying appliances with better ratings. Now the good news: over the three years to 2021-22, prices are expected to fall by 7 per cent, mainly because wholesale prices will fall as more power comes from renewables generation, which is very cheap. Really? That much, eh? So don’t imagine retail prices will ever fall back to anything like what they were. And even as more and more of our power comes from renewables, there’ll be a lot of new cost coming from the rejig of the transmission network needed to connect to the different locations of the renewables’ generators. By June last year, the proportion of the national market’s electricity generated by wind and solar had reached 16 per cent. It’s expected to reach 27 per cent by 2022, and be above 40 per cent in 2030.  There is huge variance between the states on their rate of transition. With its hydro and wind, Tasmania is close to 100 per cent renewables. South Australia is up at 53 per cent, leaving the rest of us between 10 and 20 per cent. Loading Contrary to Morrison’s claim that we’re a “world leader” in renewables investment, the report says we’re in the same class as Ireland, California, Germany, Spain and Portugal. All that’s before you take account of rooftop solar. The report says it’s our high prevalence of rooftop that’s uniquely Australian. It’s now equivalent to 5 per cent on top of the national market’s total generation, and expected to be 10 per cent by 2030. So don’t let anyone tell you we’re not getting on with the shift to renewables. But, by the same token, don’t imagine we’re doing anything like enough. We need to get to carbon-free electricity long before 2050, not just to do our bit in limiting global warming but because, as the report confirms, Australia has a “global comparative advantage in renewable energy”. We’d be mugs not to exploit it.

Your knees dangle into open air.  For 15 years, the contraption, called a motorized paraglider, has taken photographer George Steinmetz across 25 different countries. From airport to airport, Steinmetz carried his personal aircraft, which could be disassembled and stashed in three bags, each weighing about 50 pounds, that he would proceed to check in.  Launching himself over remote swaths of desert, stark Arctic terrains and cheek-by-jowl shorelines, Steinmetz has documented, from the sky, the way human activity has shaped Earth. The result is The Human Planet: Earth at the Dawn of the Anthropocene, a photographic record of our planet in the anthropocene age — a word that refers to the mark humans have made on the global landscape (\"anthropos\" is Greek for human). The accompanying text is by science writer Andrew Revkin.  NPR spoke to Steinmetz about what it was like to glide over some of the most isolated regions in the world — and about the overwhelming signs he saw of humanity's footprint.  This interview has been edited for length and clarity.  What inspired you to begin working on The Human Planet?  The book came out of a project I did for the New York Times Magazine. They asked me to go and photograph climate change on all seven continents from the air. And it made me think more globally than I tend to do, and it filled in a lot of gaps I had in my coverage of the planet. After that was done, I decided it would be interesting to go back through my archive and kind of reinterpret what I've been seeing for the past 30 years, looking at our fragile planet in a different way.  You'd been taking aerial photos for National Geographic as well.  I've been working for National Geographic for over 30 years, and [aerial photos] were always the most fun and exciting part of the story. I started doing that more and more, until finally, I wanted to do a story in the Sahara and realized I had to bring my own aircraft because there were no helicopters or planes to hire in these [areas of] Niger and Chad where I wanted to go. I had to learn how to fly my own thing.  Could you tell us a bit about what it was like taking pictures aerially?  It's kind of personal because your body is the aircraft. It is some physical risk to go and see the world. You have to have to be fairly committed to taking the picture. And that made it a much richer experience. Now, I used drones a lot and drones are wonderful, but you don't have the same physical commitment.  A lot of the work was done with a motorized paraglider, which is the world's lightest and slowest motorized aircraft. You run to take off and land. It's a very personal kind of aerial photography, [because] there's no barrier between you and the outside.  You have to watch out for your knees getting in the picture.  I had a lot of unusual experiences flying in very rare places — like getting caught in sandstorms, some bad crashes. You have a lot of really epic moments where you see things that no one's ever seen before.  What were some of those epic moments?  In the empty quarter of Saudi Arabia, [I flew over] the world's largest sand sea. It's about the size of France, Belgium and Holland combined without a single permanent point of water or habitation, and it's [practically] just an endless field of orange sand dunes. You feel like you're hallucinating out there. I also had a really amazing experience flying in the High Andes in the Altiplano of Bolivia. There's a salt lake there called the Salar de Uyuni, the world's largest salt flat. It's very surreal, especially in the spring when the fringes of it are covered in water. You feel like it's like something out of a dream. It's really beautiful.  You took these images before the coronavirus crisis, but I wonder if the pandemic has added any new layers of meaning to these photos?  We are in a time when humans have become the dominant force in the land. I think it's time to reflect on what we're all doing with our lives and maybe our place in the world.

As sea-level rise and coastal storms continue to threaten thousands of coastal communities and economies, investing in living shorelines can help reduce risk from floods and storms and increase the resiliency of Oregon's coast.  “Coastal communities bear a disproportionate burden when it comes to the severe impacts of climate chaos —? from limited fishing seasons to increased ocean acidity that caused a die-off of baby oysters to erosion and flood concerns along our shores,” Merkley said. “Creating living shorelines that use natural materials and offer an ecological benefit will help Oregon's coastal communities and economies be more resilient in the face of climate chaos. We need to help them make that investment.”  “Climate change is here, it’s happening now, and communities in Oregon and across America are already feeling its impacts,” Wyden said. “For states like Oregon where our coasts are treasured not only for their beauty, but also the economic value they provide, making investments to protect our coasts is just commonsense. We can’t afford inaction.”  Living shorelines are a type of green infrastructure that protect and stabilize coastal edges by using natural materials such as plants, sand, shell, or rock. Unlike a concrete seawall or other artificial structure, which impedes the growth of plants and animals, living shorelines can grow over time, allowing them to adapt to changing conditions. Using green and natural infrastructure, communities can create a buffer that mitigates the impacts of shoreline flooding by reducing wave energy and decreasing erosion. Green infrastructure is cost-effective and can also provide benefits such as improved local water quality and ecology.  The Living Shorelines Act will:  Establish a grant program to help states, towns, and NGOs implement climate resilient living shoreline projects and encourage the use of natural materials in the protection of coastal communities;  Direct NOAA to develop criteria to select grantees based on the potential of the project to protect the community, and the ecological benefits of the project, among other things;  Prioritize areas that have received a Stafford Act disaster declaration or areas that have a documented history of coastal inundation or erosion; and  Authorize $50 million a year for these grants.  Supporters of the Living Shorelines Act include The National Wildlife Federation, the Nature Conservancy, and the American Society of Landscape Architects.  Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ) has introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives. In addition to Merkley and Wyden, the Living Shorelines Act is co-sponsored by Senators Harris (D-CA), Murphy (D-CT), Feinstein (D-CA), Blumenthal (D-CT), Menendez (D-NJ), and Booker (D-NJ).

At a General Assembly held almost entirely virtually due to Covid-19, Trump delivered a speech in full election campaign mode, even using his loaded term \"China virus.\"  \"We must hold accountable the nations which unleashed this plague onto the world -- China,\" Trump said in a previous recorded address to the General Assembly, where each nation was represented by a single, masked delegate.  \"Those who attack America's exceptional environmental record while ignoring China's rampant pollution are not interested in the environment. They only want to punish America. And I will not stand for it,\" he said.  Trump renewed his criticism of China's role in the respiratory disease, news of which was suppressed when cases first emerged late last year in Wuhan.  \"The Chinese government, and the World Health Organization –- which is virtually controlled by China –- falsely declared that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission,\" Trump said, referring to initial statements by the UN health body that it later revised.  Trump has given notice that the United States is pulling out of the World Health Organization.  Washington has been the greatest contributor to the health body, which has tackled polio, malaria and other illnesses around the world  Critics say Trump is trying to shift blame for his handling of Covid-19 in the United States -- where nearly 200,000 people have died, more than in any other country.  His Democratic rival in November 3 elections, Joe Biden, has vowed to keep the United States in the WHO if he wins.   - 'Great Fracture' -  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, opening the General Assembly, warned of the risks of rising tensions between the United States and China.  \"We must do everything to avoid a new Cold War,\" Guterres said.  \"We are moving in a very dangerous direction. Our world cannot afford a future where the two largest economies split the globe in a Great Fracture -- each with its own trade and financial rules and internet and artificial intelligence capacities.\"  The Trump administration has launched a global campaign against the influence of China, pushing back on its claims in the South China Sea and warning nations of the risks of accepting its lavish infrastructure spending.  China has been increasingly assertive, with some experts saying that it sees an opportunity at a time that the world is preoccupied with Covid-19.  Guterres also criticized the nationalist approach to the coronavirus, without naming Trump or other world leaders.  \"Populism and nationalism have failed.

In a six-page letter to Robin Silvester, CEO of the port authority, Wilkinson flagged “gaps in information” on the project’s risks to vital salmon habitat, critically endangered southern resident killer whales, migratory birds, human health and First Nations’ use of the area for traditional practices — as well as the port authority’s plans to minimize those harms.  Wilkinson’s Aug. 24 order came days before the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency flagged concerns about the project’s impacts on Indigenous communities south of the border, as well as effects on orcas and migratory birds.  The minister’s request, welcomed by some opponents of the port expansion, is expected to delay a decision on whether the project should be allowed to proceed until next year.  “I’m really encouraged that he is asking very pertinent questions and requesting specific, detailed information about mitigation … and the implications of the project,” said Misty MacDuffee, a biologist and wild salmon program director with Raincoast Conservation Foundation.  Her concern is that the port may not be able to collect all the information Wilkinson requested — including on potential impacts on southern resident killer whales — within a reasonable timeframe.  If that’s the case, there will continue to be uncertainty about how effective proposed mitigation measures will be, MacDuffee said.  “Things cannot get worse for these whales if we have any hope of recovering them,” she said. “And this project … is going to make it worse for whales.”  In a statement to The Narwhal, Duncan Wilson, the port authority’s vice-president of environment, community and government affairs, said: “We believe much of the information we have been asked to provide will, on top of our existing proposed mitigation measures, demonstrate how we will further reduce project-related effects.”  Expansion would impact 177 hectares of the Fraser River estuary  The Roberts Bank expansion involves building a new three-berth container terminal and expanding the existing causeway and tug basin across 177 hectares of the Fraser River estuary, which serves as critical habitat for salmon, orcas and migratory birds.  The project, which would double the size of the existing terminal, would be immediately next to Tsawwassen First Nation’s lands and would add to existing industrial pressures in the area, further impacting the nation’s food security and access to the land and water.  According to Wilson, Terminal 2, which would see a jump from 329 vessels last year to 468 by 2035 if the project proceeds, “is needed to facilitate Canada’s growing trade with Asian markets beyond the mid- to late-2030s.”  Wilkinson asks for more details on threats to salmon, orcas before deciding project’s fate  Citing the findings of a federally appointed review panel, Wilkinson said the expansion would likely have “significant adverse effects,” even with the port authority’s existing mitigation measures. The minister said he needs more details to determine whether those mitigation measures are feasible.  Wilkinson asked how the project would affect the abundance and accessibility of crabs and how that, in turn, could impact First Nations food security.  He also requested a description of planned offsets to replace fish habitat that would be destroyed by the expansion and asked the port authority to summarize the effectiveness of its past offsetting projects.  Wilkinson said he wants a plan that times construction work for periods when southern resident killer whales aren’t in the area, as well as an exclusion zone, ways to detect the orcas’ presence in the exclusion zone and a plan to stop activities when they enter the area to minimize the impact of noise on the endangered population.  He asked for updated estimates of the sound levels orcas would be exposed to from port operations and increased marine shipping as well as confirmation of projected vessel traffic, including traffic levels beyond 2035.  As well, Wilkinson asked the port authority to reassess how much the southern residents’ echolocation would be masked by noise associated with the project and to provide a plan to mitigate underwater noise from operations and, where possible, marine shipping.  A key issue Wilkinson raised concerns about was the southern residents’ behavioural response to continuous noise.  But addressing the scientific uncertainty around that question will be a “big job,” MacDuffee said.  “What we assume now is that these effects of noise can only be mitigated by lowering the number of vessels and the sound of these vessels — that slowing them down is potentially just a trade-off for longer exposure,” she said.  Along with noise, the project has the potential to cause further harm to chinook salmon, a key food source for the southern residents.  “We cannot say that we are going to try and save and recover salmon populations in the Fraser and go ahead with this project,” MacDuffee said.  Questions remain on risks to migratory birds  James Casey, the Fraser River estuary specialist with Birds Canada, said he was disappointed with the lack of additional information Wilkinson requested on impacts to migratory birds.  The Fraser River estuary is globally significant habitat for migratory birds, including western sandpipers, a small shorebird that stops to refuel in the Fraser delta on its 10,000-kilometre migration from Peru to Alaska. These birds rely on biofilm, a layer of diatoms and bacteria, on the mudflats at Roberts Bank for vital fatty acids, and there is concern the port expansion could affect biofilm production.  Given that the federal review panel was unable to determine whether the port expansion would impact the population levels of western sandpipers, the request for additional information was an opportunity to address that uncertainty, Casey said.  “But the minister decided not to take that approach,” he said.  Wilkinson asked the port for additional modelling related to potential impacts on shorebirds in the event that different on-site design options were being considered.  Casey said he believes the federal government should reject the project given the risks to a broad suite of species, including migratory birds, and launch an estuary planning process.  “We have responsibilities, yes to the birds and the biodiversity of the region, but also to the people along the flyways from countries such as Peru and Mexico and the U.S. to make sure that we do our part to protect these bird species, and I think that’s an obligation that we are dropping the ball on right now,” he said.  U.S. EPA weighs in, urging adoption of mitigation measures  Organizations on the other side of the border have also raised concerns about the terminal expansion. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency wrote to the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada on Aug. 27 in support of concerns that had already been raised by the Suquamish Tribe, the Lummi Nation, the National Audubon Society and the Washington State Department of Ecology.  “Consistent with this input, EPA recognizes that salmon, shellfish and other marine life are the foundation of many of the Pacific Northwest tribes’ subsistence, economy, culture, spiritual life and day-to-day existence,” the agency wrote.  “EPA encourages decisions — and, where appropriate, measures and practices — that ensure that the significance and integrity of way-of-life activities will be maintained during the proposed activities,” the letter continued.  The agency called for measures to reduce harms to the southern residents and urged the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority to “firmly commit to developing biofilm habitat in the Fraser River estuary to offset the potential impacts” to migratory birds, including the western sandpiper.  Roberts Bank Terminal 2 decision likely delayed to next year  The port authority has requested an extension of the timeline for a federal decision on the project, given the additional information sought by the minister and requests from some Indigenous groups for further consultation.  In his statement, Wilson noted the report from the federal review panel was released in the midst of a global pandemic, which posed challenges for in-person consultation.  “During our remote consultation with Indigenous groups over the last few months, groups have asked for more time to support their participation and their own internal community process, and we want to support and respect these requests,” he said.  “We believe that meaningful consultation and engagement with Indigenous groups is key to building this project in the right way,” he said.  In its letter requesting the extension, the port authority noted that while “a delay could have some implications for the project commencement date should all approvals be obtained, we believe that such implications would be manageable, and it is preferable to take the time necessary to support the above noted activities.”  Wilson said the port authority is aiming to provide the requested information by early next year and hopes a final decision on the project will be made before the summer of 2021.  — With files from Stephanie Wood  The proposed expansion of the Deltaport terminal at Roberts Bank would double its size.

The global mean MOHT is within the uncertainty of the observational estimates. However, a correct simulation of the MOHT for individual ocean basins is more challenging, and the Atlantic MOHT south of 30°N is underestimated. The partitioning of the MOHT into the overturning and gyre components is generally consistent with such partitioning in an observationally optimized ocean model. At low latitudes, the time-mean MOHT is dominated by its overturning component, whereas in the Southern Ocean and, especially, in the subpolar North Atlantic, it is the gyre component that plays a more important role. In the projected warmer climates, CanESM2 simulates a weakening of the poleward MOHT essentially in both hemispheres. The projected MOHT changes are largely determined by the overturning component, except in the subpolar Atlantic where it is dominated by the gyre component. Consistent with (the limited number of) previous studies, the seasonal variability of the MOHT is large and is mostly driven by the seasonal variability of the meridional Ekman transport. In the simulated warmer climates, the seasonal cycle of the MOHT is projected to change, mostly in the tropics and also in the Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes. The eddy contribution to the MOHT is broadly consistent with that in the observationally optimized eddy-permitting model. However, in the tropics a significant fraction of the eddy energy is converted back to the mean circulation, and the heat transports due to the parameterized and permitted eddies differ.  In a warmer climate, the thermal structure of the ocean and its circulation (including the seasonal component) could change. Hence, our third goal is to evaluate the changes in the time-mean and seasonal MOHTs under some of the scenarios developed for IPCC AR5 (due for publication in 2013/14).  The observational estimates of MOHT provide valuable information for evaluating climate system models. Our focus here is on the MOHT simulated by one such model—the second generation Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM2.) This is a much improved version of the coupled model described in Flato et al. (2000) (see section 2 ), which has been employed recently to conduct climate change simulations in support of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5). The first goal is to compare the CanESM2 MOHT with some existing observational estimates. However, the data from hydrographic sections are often too sparse to evaluate the eddy component of the MOHT. While CanESM2 does not resolve mesoscale variability in the ocean, it has the effect of mesoscale eddies (on the large-scale ocean transport) parameterized. As such, we will also compare the MOHT simulated by CanESM2 with the MOHT derived from an observationally optimized eddy-permitting simulation (see section 2 ).  Time-mean (1992–96) meridional ocean heat transport (MOHT, positive northward) from (a) the CanESM2 historical simulations (global ocean), (b) the ECCO2 simulation (global ocean), (c) the CanESM2 historical simulations (Atlantic–Arctic basin), and (d) the CanESM2 historical simulations (Indo-Pacific basin).

In the case of CanESM2, υ includes the eddy-induced component via the Gent and McWilliams (1990) parameterization. In addition, we will decompose the MOHT into overturning and gyre components following the approach of Bryan (1982a) . The overturning heat transport is calculated as the integral of the product ρ 0 c p 〈θ〉〈υ〉, whereas the gyre component is calculated as the integral of the product ρ 0 c p θ*υ* (where θ* = θ − 〈θ〉 and υ* = υ − 〈υ〉). In the case of CanESM2, monthly mean υ and θ are utilized (the use of more frequent datasets was found to be nonessential at the relatively coarse resolution employed in CanESM2). For the corresponding calculations at the eddy-permitting resolution (i.e., in the case of ECCO2) 3-day averages of υ and θ are used. The heat transports are calculated for the Atlantic–Arctic and Indo-Pacific basins, as well as for the global ocean.  As part of the CanESM2 evaluation, we also employ ocean model data from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean project, phase II (ECCO2), which are available from 1992 onward. The ECCO2 data are obtained from a freely running and optimized high-resolution simulation based on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model ( Marshall et al. 1997 ). The model parameters have been optimized using the Green function approach ( Menemenlis et al. 2005 ), with the baseline integration derived from a globally optimized simulation ( Menemenlis et al. 2008 ). The surface forcing was derived from the Japanese 25-year Reanalysis Project ( Onogi et al. 2007 ) and converted to wind stress and buoyancy forcing using a bulk formula. The ECCO2 model employs a cube-sphere grid projection with mean horizontal grid spacing ~18 km. The model data used here have been optimally interpolated (and, for vectors, rotated) onto a 0.25 × 0.25 latitude × longitude grid. To ensure mass conservation, we have also applied a uniform adjustment to the interpolated ECCO2 velocity; the computed MOHT was found to be insensitive to such an adjustment. ECCO2 has 50 vertical levels with spacings ranging from 10 m near the surface to 456 m near the bottom. The variables of interest (ocean meridional velocity and potential temperature) are available online (see http://ecco2.jpl.nasa.gov/products/ ).  The CanESM2 historical simulations (1850–2005) serve as our base experiments. The five ensemble members are spawned from a long (>1000 yr) preindustrial control run at an interval of 50 years. Two groups of climate projections (2006–2100) were initiated from the end of each historical run. These are based on the newly developed representative concentration pathways (RCPs) of radiatively important greenhouse gases ( http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~mmalte/rcps/index.htm ), forced with specified concentrations following the medium mitigation scenario (RCP4.5) and the high emission scenario (RCP8.5). The design of the climate change experiments is part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (details of which can be found online at http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/ ). The analyses for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 are based upon the last 10 years of the corresponding CanESM2 simulations (2091–2100), whereas the CanESM2 historical simulations are analyzed for the period of 1992–96. The former period ensures that the results, while being statistically robust, are close to the targeted radiative forcing at year 2100. The 1992–96 period, in turn, is to accommodate the observations that are based primarily upon the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) ( GW2003 ). It should be noted that the main conclusions remain essentially the same when 20-yr periods (1981–2000, 2081–2100) are chosen for the analysis of the CanESM2 simulations.  The time-mean MOHT simulated by CanESM2 for the global ocean is shown in Fig. 1a. It agrees with the MOHT estimated by GW2003 within the error bars. The peak values of the global northward heat transport in the CanESM2 ocean range from −1.1 PW around 12°S to 1.6 PW around 21°N (Fig. 1a). Hence, the corresponding maximum heat divergence from the low-latitude ocean, which ultimately must balance the heat gained by the tropical ocean at the surface, is 2.7 PW. Apparently, the corresponding value is lower in ECCO2 (Fig. 1b) during the period of interest here. This could be due to the constraint imposed on the surface heat flux in ECCO2. It could also result from the stronger heat convergence associated with the gyre component in the tropical ECCO2 as discussed in the next paragraph. In addition, it may be related to the strong eddy contribution to the MOHT in ECCO2, particularly at low latitudes where it tends to oppose the poleward heat transport by the mean currents. The eddy heat transport will be discussed in section 5.  In both CanESM2 and ECCO2, most of the surface heat gain by the low-latitude ocean is diverged poleward by the overturning component of the MOHT (Figs. 1a,b). The gyre component opposes this process between about 12°S and 20°N in CanESM2 and between about 20°S and 20°N in ECCO2 (Figs. 1a,b), mostly carrying heat toward the tropics. This means, according to the gyre heat transport definition, that the equatorward (poleward) circulation anomaly (relative to the zonal mean velocity) typically carries positive (negative) temperature anomaly in the tropics. The maximum heat convergence into the tropical ocean by the gyre component (i.e., the corresponding peak-to-peak difference) is somewhat larger in ECCO2 compared to that in CanESM2. It is also interesting to note that in both models the gyre component dominates the net poleward MOHT in the Southern Ocean and, especially, around 50°N. We shall touch on the latter below when addressing the heat transport components in the Atlantic.  While the global ocean MOHT simulated by CanESM2 is generally within the GW2003 error bars, it is of interest to partition it into the contributions from the Atlantic–Arctic and Indo-Pacific basins. The corresponding MOHTs are compared in Figs. 1c,d with the MOHT estimates based on the WOCE and some pre-WOCE hydrography; the estimates from the recent continuous observations derived from the Rapid Climate Change (RAPID) array (Johns et al. 2011), and the Argo data (Hobbs and Willis 2012) are also presented. We note that GW2003 have documented the data consistency between pre-WOCE and the WOCE periods. It should also be pointed out that over the last one to two decades, there seem to have been only weak statistically significant trends in the large-scale ocean circulation and heat transport (e.g., Wunsch and Heimbach 2006, 2009).  In agreement with the observations, the Atlantic–Arctic heat transport in CanESM2 is directed northward at all latitudes (Fig. 1c). This appears to be due to the circulation associated with the formation of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) (e.g., Bryden and Imawaki 2001; TC2001). However, our analysis indicates that, while the global ocean heat transport can be simulated reasonably well, a correct simulation of the MOHT for individual ocean basins may present a challenge (Figs. 1c,d). Essentially, CanESM2 underestimates the observed northward heat transport through most of the Atlantic–Arctic basin, particularly south of about 30°N (Fig. 1c). This seems to be related to the simulated NADW being somewhat too weak and too shallow (Fig. 2a), as compared to observational estimates (e.g., see Fig. 2b in Talley et al. 2003). The associated meridional overturning circulation operates on the weaker than observed temperature contrast in the upper 2 km of the ocean (Figs. 2a,b). In addition, in the Atlantic abyss (below about 2 km) the recirculation of Antarctic Bottom Water operates on the stronger than observed temperature contrast (Figs. 2a,b). This also contributes to the bias in the CanESM2 Atlantic heat transport. In the Indo-Pacific, the model tends to underestimate the southward heat transport around 20°S (Fig. 1d) (although the corresponding estimate is still within the error bars). Thus, the correspondence between the simulated and observed global ocean MOHT in the Southern Hemisphere (Fig. 1a) may, in part, be a result of the biases in the MOHTs simulated for the individual ocean basins that tend to cancel each other in the global mean (Figs. 1c,d). However, it should be noted that the uncertainties in the observational estimates are large, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere.  In the Northern Hemisphere, the situation is somewhat more encouraging. In particular, at 24°N in the Atlantic, which has perhaps the most abundant observations, the CanESM2 MOHT is in good agreement with the observational estimates of Macdonald (1998) and Bryden (1993). It is, however, somewhat weaker than the MOHT estimated for this latitude by GW2003 and Lavin et al. (1998). Around 50°N in the Atlantic–Arctic basin (and also in the global mean) there is suddenly an increase in the CanESM2 MOHT (mainly due to the gyre). This is consistent with GW2003, whereas the indirect estimates of TC2001 do not show this increase. In the North Pacific, the simulated MOHT is in good agreement with the available observational estimates (Fig. 1d), although the density of observations is low compared to the North Atlantic.  Much as for the global ocean, it is of interest to partition the MOHT into the overturning and gyre components for the individual basins. In the Atlantic the overturning component transports about 80% of the heat between the equator and 40°N, reaching a maximum of 1.0 PW at 14°N. While this is somewhat larger than the modeled value in Gulev et al. (2003), our Atlantic overturning-to-gyre heat transport ratio in CanESM2 appears to be lower than that estimated by Johns et al. (2011). In particular, using continuous array data, Johns et al. report that about 90% of the MOHT (1.33 ± 0.14 PW) across 26.5°N in the Atlantic could be due to the overturning component. In the South Atlantic the gyre component becomes important around 10°S, whereas at 30°S it is the overturning component that dominates the northward MOHT (cf. GW2003, their Fig. 8).  However, in the subpolar Atlantic–Arctic, it is the gyre component that takes the leading role and contributes more than 85% to the net northward heat transport in CanESM2 (Fig. 1c). This is in general agreement with the corresponding model-based estimates of Gulev et al. (2003, see their Fig. 2b). One reason for the dominance of the gyre component over the overturning component in the subpolar Atlantic is that the North Atlantic Current carries relatively warm waters northeastward. Upon giving their heat to the atmosphere, some of these waters return southward along the western boundary, thereby contributing to the gyrelike heat transport in the subpolar Atlantic.

Early Life and Education  Jagmeet Singh Jimmy Dhaliwal, leader of the New Democratic Party of Canada 2017–present, MPP, lawyer (born 2 January 1979 in Scarborough, ON). Singh is the first racialized leader of a major national political party in Canada. He was also the first turban-wearing Sikh elected to the Ontario legislature.  Jagmeet Singh was born on 2 January 1979 in Scarborough, Ontario. He was the eldest of three children born to his mother, Harmeet Kaur, and his father, Jagtaran Singh, a psychiatrist. When he was one year old, Singh was sent to his family’s native Punjab, India, to live with his grandparents. At the time, his mother and father were struggling to make ends meet and look after the baby. Harmeet was working in a bank, while Jagtaran was working as a security guard and studying for his medical recertification (he had trained as a physician in India but had to qualify to practise in Canada). However, it wasn’t long before Singh was reunited with his parents and moved with them to St. John’s, Newfoundland, so that his father could attend Memorial University. His sister, Manjot, and brother, Gurratan, were born in Newfoundland. Singh learned English in Newfoundland, where he was known as “Jimmy.”  When Singh was seven, his family moved to Windsor, Ontario, where he grew up. There, he used his given name, Jagmeet. Concerned about bullying, his father sent him to the private Detroit Country Day School in the United States, across the river from Windsor, where he excelled in academics and athletics. As is the egalitarian Sikh custom — to diminish the influence of the caste system of social class distinction — he uses the last name Singh rather than Dhaliwal.  After completing high school, he attended Western University, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in biology before going to Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto.   Early Career  While Jagmeet Singh spent most of his youth in the New Democratic Party (NDP) hotbed of Windsor, he said he did not become interested in partisan politics until he worked as a criminal defence lawyer in Brampton, ON. “I haven’t been a long-time party activist, I’ve been a long-time sympathizer, you could say. Criminal defence is a bit more liberal, more left wing because of the…social justice aspect of it. We’re advocates of the Canadian Charter [of Rights and Freedoms],” he told the Toronto Star.  Singh did volunteer legal work for social justice groups fighting poverty, helped immigrants and refugees with rights claims, and visited university campuses to give free legal seminars to students.   2011 Federal Election  Moved by the injustices he saw, Jagmeet Singh decided to enter electoral politics. He ran for the federal NDP in the May 2011 federal election in the riding of Bramalea-Gore-Malton. While the party’s then-leader Jack Layton guided the New Democrats to their best ever showing — finishing second to Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s Conservatives — Singh did not ride the NDP’s “orange wave” to victory. Losing by just 539 votes, he was a close runner-up to Conservative Bal Gosal. However, Singh finished ahead of long-time Liberal incumbent Gurbax Malhi, himself a pioneer in 1993 as the first turbaned member of Parliament elected outside India.  While Singh was bitterly disappointed at his loss, his strong showing excited New Democrats. “After that first one I wanted to take a break. Losing is tough, especially when it’s so close. It was really the party that gave me a lot of encouragement — and the community. I got maybe 200 to 300 phone calls of people saying, ‘Don’t give up.’”   Provincial Politics  Jagmeet Singh was convinced to run for Ontario NDP Leader Andrea Horwath’s party in the same riding (Bramalea-Gore-Malton) in the October 2011 provincial election. Attracting youthful volunteers, who treated his campaign office as an after-school community centre, and using social media effectively, Singh won the riding with 38.16 per cent of the vote compared with 32.93 per cent for Liberal incumbent Kuldip Kular. He was the first NDP member of Ontario’s Provincial Parliament (MPP) ever elected in Peel Region.  At the legislature at Queen’s Park, the affable and charismatic newcomer made a stylish entrance. With his red BMW Z4 M coupe, Brompton folding bike, bespoke suits, and colourful turbans, he quickly became one of the most recognizable MPPs. With tens of thousands of Twitter and Instagram followers, he emerged as a rare Canadian celebrity politician, frequently photographed at swish receptions for the society pages.  The Toronto Star anointed Singh as one of its 12 people to watch in 2012, extolling his skills at Brazilian jiu-jitsu and noting he was the first turban-wearing Sikh to sit in the Ontario legislature.   First Term, MPP  At Queen’s Park, Jagmeet Singh championed auto insurance reform and introduced a motion in 2013 to force Premier Kathleen Wynne’s fledgling minority Liberal government to gradually reduce private passenger premiums by 15 per cent. Cutting rates was a key demand of Horwath’s New Democrats in exchange for propping up Wynne’s administration.  In December 2013, Singh was refused a visa to enter India, over comments he had made on that country’s record on human rights. He had been trying to fly to Amritsar, India, to receive the SEWA Sikh of the Year award. Instead, he had to accept the honour in a video presentation and dedicated it to Indian human rights activist Bhai Gurbakhsh Singh Khalsa. Singh said the Indian consulate in Toronto told him he was refused a visa because he was an “outspoken critic” of India’s treatment of minorities, including Sikhs, Muslims, and Christians.  On 2 May 2014, Horwath announced that the New Democrats, along with Tim Hudak’s Progressive Conservatives (PC), would not support the Liberal government budget, plunging Ontario into an election campaign. While the NDP had triggered the snap vote, the party’s lacklustre campaign was disorganized and plagued by internal sniping. Ever the team player, Singh was one of the only MPPs to attend the launch of the party’s campaign manifesto at the University of Toronto.  NDP politicians Olivia Chow and Jagmeet Singh at a Labour Day parade in Toronto, 1 September 2014.   Second Term, MPP  In the 12 June 2014 election, Singh retained his seat but the NDP lost ground, becoming the third party in the legislature dominated by a majority Liberal government. Still, Singh’s profile remained high.  He was an outspoken advocate of ending the police practice of random spot checks — known as “carding” — that unfairly target visible minorities. He spoke movingly about experiencing the humiliation of being carded in both Toronto and Windsor, telling the Toronto Star, “it made me feel intimidated. It made me feel unsafe … like I just didn’t belong.”  When Wynne’s government decided it would not grant turban-wearing Sikhs an exemption to Ontario’s motorcycle helmet law, Singh noted there was support in the Liberal, PC, and NDP caucuses for a legal exemption — something already in place in Britain, and in British Columbia and Manitoba.  On 20 April 2015, Horwath announced Singh would be the NDP’s deputy leader. Her surprise move came after Singh had turned down weeks of overtures from national NDP leader Thomas Mulcair to run as a candidate in that year’s federal election. “I would never have thought that a little kid from Windsor would end up being a deputy leader of a provincial party one day, so it’s a great honour,” he said.  In 2016, Singh and four other provincial New Democrats opposed a joint Liberal and PC motion to formally denounce the BDS movement — boycott, divest, sanctions — that targets Israel. Singh warned the motion was contrary to “the right to dissent,” but it passed easily in the legislature.   NDP Leadership Campaign  After the federal NDP’s disappointing result in the 2015 election, the party ousted leader Thomas Mulcair at a convention in 2016, clearing the way for a leadership contest. Singh remained coy about whether he might seek the leadership, enjoying instead his celebrity as an Ontario MPP. In February 2017, he was featured in the American men’s style magazine GQ — in an article headlined “A Chat with Jagmeet Singh, the Incredibly Well-Dressed Rising Star in Canadian Politics” — where he said he was “honoured” to be considered a potential federal leader.  Finally, on 15 May 2017, Singh launched his campaign at a Brampton banquet hall beneath a slogan reading “With Love & Courage.” His platform included a plan to decriminalize all illegal drugs — treating addiction as a public health crisis rather than a law enforcement issue — and to ban racial profiling by federal entities like the RCMP. It also included a pledge to reform Canada’s electoral system.  In the all-candidates’ debates, Singh, the only candidate on the stage from the provincial arena, was repeatedly asked if he would run for a federal seat even if he lost the leadership. “I will be winning, and once I win, I will run federally,” he said at a debate in Vancouver. That drew a response from candidate and Manitoba MP Niki Ashton that underscored how much the NDP establishment viewed Singh as an interloper. “I want to acknowledge that it’s up to the members to decide who is going to win this race,” said Ashton.  The most sensational moment of an otherwise sleepy NDP leadership contest came at a campaign rally in Brampton on 6 September 2017. As he stood at the front of the room, Singh was accosted by a heckler named Jennifer Bush, a supporter of an anti-Islamic fringe group. As cameras rolled, an agitated Bush chided Singh for being “in bed with the Muslim brotherhood.” Singh remained calm. Displaying grace under pressure, he encouraged his supporters in a chant of “love and courage” to drown out the hysterical protester. Video of the encounter was viewed more than 35 million times online after it went viral on Twitter and Facebook. He also won praise for not responding to Bush’s claim he was a Muslim. “I didn’t answer the question because my response to Islamophobia has never been: ‘I’m not Muslim.’ It has always been, and will be, that hate is wrong. Once allowed to grow, hate doesn’t pick and choose,” he said.  The encounter electrified New Democrats. Even though it was known that Singh had already sold more party memberships than his rivals, his position as the front-runner was solidified.  NDP members began voting by mail and online on 18 September, with the results of the first ballot announced on 1 October. Singh won a first-ballot victory with 53.8 per cent of the vote. His closest rival, Ontario MP Charlie Angus, received 19.4 per cent. Three weeks after winning the federal leadership, Singh resigned his Bramalea-Gore-Malton seat in the Ontario legislature. He was greeted with a standing ovation by MPPs from all three parties when he made a farewell appearance at Queen’s Park.   Federal NDP Leader  With no seat in the House of Commons, Singh named another leadership candidate, Québec MP Guy Caron, as the party’s leader in Parliament — an appointment seen as a concession to Québecers, who had been instrumental in Jack Layton’s success in 2011 yet were leery of the new leader. Singh said he was “confident … we will be able to grow in Québec” in the 2019 election. However, he also took a strong stance against that province’s controversial Bill 62, which would ban Muslim women from giving or receiving public services while wearing a face covering.  Singh made headlines early in his tenure during an interview with CBC Television. Asked if he condemned Sikhs who revere and display posters of Talwinder Singh Parmar — the reputed mastermind of the 1985 Air India bombing that killed 329 people — Singh called the bombing a “heinous massacre.” However, he pointedly did not denounce those Sikhs who still pay homage to Parmar. (Parmar was tortured and killed by Indian police in 1992.) “I don’t know who’s responsible [for the Air India tragedy] but I think we need to find out who’s responsible, we need to make sure that the investigation results in a conviction of someone who is actually responsible,” the NDP leader said.  One of the most serious challenges facing Singh and the federal NDP was the proposed expansion of the Trans Mountain Pipeline. Rachel Notley, the NDP premier of Alberta, supported the project. However, John Horgan, the NDP premier of British Columbia, opposed the pipeline. Horgan’s minority government depended on the support of the BC Green Party and was fully committed to halting the pipeline expansion. This conflict put Singh and the federal NDP in a difficult position. For months, Singh tried to remain neutral, calling for a more thorough environmental assessment of the project. However, in May 2018, he announced his opposition, leading Notley to call his position “naive.”  By this point, Singh still did not have a seat in the House of Commons. In August 2018, Singh announced that he would run in the Burnaby South by-election in British Columbia. The Vancouver-area riding had been vacant since June, when NDP MP Kennedy Stewart resigned to run for election as mayor of Vancouver (Stewart won the election and became mayor in October 2018). On 25 February 2019, Singh was elected MP for Burnaby South, winning 39 per cent of the vote and defeating his main rivals in the by-election, Liberal candidate Richard Lee and Conservative candidate Jay Shin.   2019 Federal Election  On 16 June 2019, Singh and the NDP announced A New Deal for People, the party’s campaign platform for the October federal election. One of its key policies was a national pharmacare program. The platform also addressed climate change, vowing to end subsidies to gas and oil companies and increase emissions targets. The party also promised to expand cell coverage and broadband Internet and set caps on Internet and cell phone bills. In addition, the NDP platform emphasized affordable housing and confirmed its commitment to reconciliation and Indigenous rights. It also promised better housing, clean water and education for First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities. To help pay for these plans, the NDP proposed increasing the corporate tax rate and highest income tax rate, as well as imposing a new one per cent wealth tax on fortunes worth over $20 million.  During the 2019 campaign, Singh announced several new policies aimed at shoring up and enhancing support in Quebec, where polls indicated that Quebecers are largely abandoning the party. Those included a promise for more money for immigrant integration, recognition of the importance of Quebec’s cultural autonomy, and an effective veto over infrastructure projects that have an environmental impact, such as pipelines. Singh also suggested that he could make Quebec — the lone province that has not signed the Canadian Constitution — a signatory, though he did not specify how he would achieve that.  Singh was also criticized — including by some in his own party — for declaring before the election campaign that he would not work with the Conservative government if it won a minority in the election and wanted to look to the party for support for some measures. Critics suggested that he was effectively conceding that the NDP could not win the election itself and said he was also forsaking a potentially valuable bargaining chip in such an event.  At the beginning of the election campaign, Singh and the NDP were virtually tied with Elizabeth May’s Green Party in public opinion polls. However, the New Democrats pulled ahead of the Greens as the election neared, due in large part to Singh’s performance in televised leader debates. He was also praised for his reaction when photos and video surfaced showing Liberal leader Justin Trudeau in blackface on three separate occasions. Rather than dwell on Trudeau’s behaviour or motivations, Singh focused on those who had been hurt by racism:  The kids that see this image, the people that see this image, are going to think of all the times that they were made fun of, that they were hurt, that they were hit, that they were insulted, that they were made to feel less because of who they are … I want you to know that you have value, you have worth and you are loved. And I don’t want you to give up on Canada, and please don’t give up on yourselves.  By the end of the election campaign, Singh and the NDP had reason to be optimistic, despite earlier predictions that it might lose party status. However, the federal election on 21 October 2019 was a disappointment in many ways. While Singh kept his seat in Burnaby South, the NDP was reduced to 24 seats in the House of Commons, dropping to fourth place overall. The party lost all but one of its seats in Quebec, where the Bloc Québécois enjoyed a resurgence. The NDP was also shut out of the Greater Toronto Area, which the Liberals dominated.

Surrounded by his rustic cabin walls laden with trophies from previous hunts and clad in his waxed jacket over top his KUIU quarter-zip, he sits at his large wood table reminiscing about his life as an outdoorsman.  “I’ve been hunting for a while,” said Bartley, a 35-year-old business owner from Mineral Wells. “I used to fish all the time, but my dad died in 2012 and my grandad died in 2015, so I couldn’t trout fish anymore. That’s when I started bird hunting.  “We started beating the bush without dogs for about two years. And I said, ‘Man this has got to be easier with a bird dog,’ so I got a pup and trained [it], and I’m not sure if it is any easier. If anything it’s harder because you have to have more   self-control.”  After a non-traditional startup in ruffed grouse hunting, Bartley and his bird dog — a Llewellin Setter named Jack — began scouring the Monongahela National Forest between Snowshoe and Canaan Valley, but it didn’t take long for him to realize that something was wrong. Bartley noted he sees roughly one bird per mile, on track with the 0.6-1.2 estimated flush rate per hour recently published by the 2018 North Carolina and 2014 Pennsylvania natural resources commission studies. As one of Bartley’s buddies would put it, “You’re 20 years too late.”  “Some guys say they see 20 birds in a day, but it’s hard to believe that,” Bartley said.  Tyler Bartley poses with a ruffed grouse he harvested in the Monongahela National Forest. (Submitted Photo)  Sometimes Bartley sees more birds on certain hunts than others, such as an outing in mid-January where he saw five birds, three in one pod together. This lack of birds put into play extensive logistics, mapping and moving quickly through thick mature forests.  Although Bartley travels across the state to hunt grouse, Parkersburg and Mineral Wells residents who visited his store report they’ve begun to see birds again this past summer.  “We’ve been here for 30 years and I’ve talked to old farmers that would say they hadn’t seen a bird in 10-15 years. So that’s kinda neat. Makes you wonder if they’re coming back and got over that West Nile deal,” Bartley said.  Understanding West Nile Virus is critical when discussing the disappearance of ruffed grouse — most bird species, really — as the virus has been destructive to populations in the lower-48 United States since its introduction in 1999. WNV is more prevalent in lower elevations where mosquitoes can breed unimpeded by colder climates, but with the recent changes in climate, fluctuations can occur in habitat that was once unsuitable to the insect. It’s because of this that states like Pennsylvania are looking for new methods of maintaining habitat so infected birds can survive the virus.  Although Bartley’s hometown has some of the lowest elevations in the state, the Monongahela National Forest has some of the highest, ranging between 1,500-4,862 feet.  Even with one problem solved with higher elevations, another exposes itself: Loss of habitat.  Bartley’s Llewellin Setter Jack rests during a hunt in the Mon National Forest. (Submitted Photo)  What’s West Virginia doing anyway?  When Bartley tried to contact a local biologist in his area, the DNR biologist was indifferent in his responses, simply telling Bartley that if he wanted to help he should clear cut his land. Then Bartley had the chance to talk to Gov. Jim Justice, a self-proclaimed avid outdoorsman, and even that conversation was off-putting.  “I talked to Gov. Jim Justice who’s a big bird hunter and he said, ‘I heard you’re a grouse hunter, how’s the hunting for you?’ I told him it was horrible and, ‘Cut some trees won’t ya?’ But he just laughed it off. They’re starting to see a decline in hunters, license sales and people visiting the forest and now they’re [figuring out] how to help the habitat,” Bartley said.  While all of this may irritate Mountain State outdoorsmen, the West Virginia DNR has been developing early successional habitat with the Ruffed Grouse Society for 5 years. The DNR also has a longstanding, 50-year cooperative agreement with the Monongahela National Forest, assigning up to 10 agents to cover areas within the forest.  In March 2016, the DNR released information about the RGS providing the agency with forestry mulching equipment that was implemented in sections of the Monongahela National Forest as part of the “West Virginia Early Successional Habitat Partnership.”  Early results in Kumbrabrow State Forest in Randolph County were positive, and, as of December 2019, after expanding to other areas, there have been 3,525.3 acres affected by mulcher and excavator activity and 770.7 acres affected by dozer work.  “We did some work at Coopers Rock, but it was more maintenance work — clearing power lines and roads — it’s sort of habitat but it wasn’t the focus, just more infrastructure,” Division of Natural Resources Wildlife Manager Robert Tallman said. “Kumbrabrow State Forest and the Greenbrier Range of the National Forest is where the bulk of the work has been happening.”  A hunting trip to the Monongahela National Forest in mid-January put Bartley and his hunting partners in the midst of a fresh snowfall. The National Forest is the prime habitat for ruffed grouse in the state due to lack of mosquitoes and the threat of West Nile Virus. (Submitted photo)  Tallman can essentially be summed up as the top dog in the Division of Natural Resources’ early successional habitat project. A 19-year veteran of the agency, Tallman started as an ornithologist and saw first-hand the effects of West Nile Virus on songbird populations. In 2015, he was tasked with the job to begin forest restoration in Kumbrabrow. Shortly after, the first report was released.  Still, Tallman’s main task isn’t dealing with WNV’s impact on bird populations. It simply isn’t a problem in the mountains, but even that can change with the ever-evolving climate.  “I don’t think anyone knows [what elevation is the cut off],” Tallman said. “Climate change, whether you believe in it or not, [is changing] things here. We’re seeing ticks and poison ivy at higher elevations we’ve never seen before.”  And even with climate science showing climate change is a real and present danger, the National Forest is what the DNR logically needs to restore first, because that’s where, according to Tallman, the core population is.  Luckily, it’s not just the DNR working on this project. With help from the Ruffed Grouse Society, West Virginia Division of Forestry, National Forest, National Wild Turkey Federation and, in some cases, the West Virginia State Parks, the project that was initially set to end in Spring 2021 could extend another four years, ending in 2025.  “The financial aspect of it was the limiting factor,” Tallman said, noting the project’s timeline. “There are partners [involved in our project] that are bringing in additional funding to continue the project for several more years. We just got word additional funding has been acquired. We haven’t worked it out yet, but [we may] be doing this through 2025.”  According to Tallman, another limiting factor can be the National Forest’s National Environmental Policy Act process. The NEPA process listed by the Monongahela National Forest notes that the act, “Ensures that environmental information is disclosed to public officials and citizens before federal decisions are made and actions are taken. … The Act also requires environmental analysis and disclosure for site-specific management actions that may be implemented under the Plan’s direction and guidance.”  Outside of that, however, he doesn’t receive grief from environmental groups — although other hunters will tell you they’re a major roadblock. Tallman notes the DNR’s transparency about the partnership and education on the matter is what’s keeping those groups at bay and has brought one local group on the agency’s side.  “Kumbrabrow is considered our proving grounds,” he said. “We do a lot of the projects here to work out the bugs if you will, and then replicate that on the National Forest. We’ve had little push back from the environmental groups, and I think that’s because we show them what we do. The Brooks Bird Club has been out on multiple occasions and is one of our biggest supporters, [but] here’s still people that don’t necessarily like what we’re doing — let’s just leave it at that.”  Now, with West Virginia’s ruffed grouse season coming to an end on Feb. 29, the cooperative will begin its hard work to get the grouse ready for the opening of the 2020-21 season.

People are no longer driving much or flying at all. Factories are silent. The supply hasn’t changed radically in the past month. It’s the demand that’s crumbled.   Environmentalists, hold that thought.  Friends on the environmental left are not always swift at gauging how the laws of economics should play into policy on climate change. Case in point, there’s talk that rich climate activists might buy some of the oil reserves for close to nothing and make sure that the fossil fuel never gets burned, according to Bloomberg.  Here’s the problem with that — actually, several problems: In response to plunging oil prices, Saudi Arabia, Russia and 21 other oil-producing nations recently agreed to restrict output to buoy it. That obviously hasn’t worked. Why would environmentalists try to help them by cutting the availability of oil? Not that they have a fraction of the resources to make a difference.  But even if they wanted to do this and it would make a difference, they’d be helping weak or deeply indebted players in the fossil fuel industry stay afloat. Even before the coronavirus hit, energy prices were swooning because of falling demand.  Power companies had been replacing natural gas (and certainly coal) with wind and solar energy, causing it to tumble in price. As a result, demand for natural gas was expected to fall 13% in the next decade, Morgan Stanley said in December. The global economic shutdown will undoubtedly greatly inflate that number.  And there’s the question of whether the continuing threat of this and other viruses will have changed work, commuting and shopping patterns well after the immediate crisis. Some plans for reopening businesses already envision fewer workers at the office and more operating from home. And with teleconferencing no longer a novelty, there’s a likelihood of people working together from different locales.  So what would have been the point of a ban on oil and gas fracking, as former presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren advocated? It would have amounted to the government getting blamed for job losses in the fossil fuel energy sector at a time when market forces were already closing down rigs.  There are valid environmental concerns that dirt-cheap oil and gas will make clean energy less competitive on price. That and scary times have eaten into sales of home solar installations. Who is doing home improvements these days? Research firm Wood Mackenzie, which had predicted a 10% increase in national residential solar sales this year over last year, now says that they could fall as much as 34%.  (One bright little aside: Skies cleared of smog have helped Germany’s solar panels generate record amounts of electricity.)  Wood Mackenzie thinks worldwide electric vehicle sales will drop 43% this year. However, Brad Berman, who covers electric sales at Electrek, told Barron’s that “the EV market is more resilient than the overall market.” For one thing, these buyers tend to have higher incomes and can power through a tough economy. For another, global auto emissions standards provide a tailwind for electric vehicle sales.  Of course, a tax on carbon would help. Many conservatives as well as many liberals have supported the idea. All the Democratic presidential candidates backed it except for Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard. Republican leaders oppose carbon taxes because they’re largely owned by the fossil fuel industry.  What’s been good for the environment is not crashing oil prices but the reason they’re crashing. The world is awash in oil that no one’s buying. It’s demand that we need to dry up — and that happens when technology enables the development of more clean energy at competitive prices.

Or that’s the apparent thesis of the Trump administration’s EPA, anyway, in its newly proposed spin on benefit-cost analysis.  Here, now, the agency with its mission to protect human health and the environment is attempting to shovel tens of thousands of pollution-caused deaths off the main page and into the margins to make regulatory inaction pencil out.  Truly, truly, this administration is challenging the public to accept that if a big number, a really big number, a tens-of-thousands-of-people-dying-prematurely-each-year number, is suddenly put into the fine print, it is no longer big, and no longer relevant. Truly.  Has this administration ever once considered that there’s another way to make the bodies go away? To pause their digging, to stop their lies, to step away from whatever newest outrage they’re about to perpetuate, and for once, see evidence of harm and have it be a call for good?   No.  Not ever. And not this day.  Once again, this day, they see the harm, and they focus on new ways to make the evidence of that harm go away. And for what? All to pad the profits of a select polluting few.   The air pollution problem  Air pollution threatens the lives and livelihoods of every single person in this country. Often invisibly, often unevenly and unjustly, all too costly. From the looming threat of climate change to the crushing immediacy of increased risk of COVID-19 mortality, it is indisputable that harmful levels of air pollution still exist; that through numerous pathways, air pollution still sickens, harms, and kills.  Which means that the EPA still has work to do. Here’s the agency, in its own words, on that front:  Despite dramatic progress cleaning the air since 1970, air pollution in the United States continues to harm people’s health and the environment. Under the Clean Air Act, EPA continues to work with state, local and tribal governments, other federal agencies, and stakeholders to reduce air pollution and the damage that it causes.  The catch is what comes next: how the agency makes that identified pollution—and all its attendant harms—go away.  Specifically, continuing to achieve public health gains by continuing to reduce pollution, such that there is less harmful pollution in the air, or instead pivoting to achieving public health gains by gaming the evidence to lower the appearance of pollution’s harms, despite there being no actual change to the amount of pollution in the air.  We know which way this one goes.  Enter the Trump EPA’s proposed changes to Clean Air Act benefit-cost analysis, the administration’s most brazen attempt yet at manipulating facts to circumvent unwanted responsibilities otherwise required by the truth.  The more we learn about air pollution, the worse it gets  The Clean Air Act is the most powerful tool we have in fighting air pollution. Not only has the landmark legislation cost-effectively facilitated the achievement of five decades of significant reductions in air pollution; it has also provided a ready framework for adding, updating, and strengthening pollution protections over time to reflect advances in scientific understanding and public health.  Advances in understanding like how persistent exposure to even very low levels of some pollutants can cause lasting harm. Advances in understanding like how unevenly distributed have been the benefits of pollution reductions to date. Advances in understanding like human-caused climate change.  Advances in understanding that make unavoidably clear just how much air pollution progress still remains to be made.  Which means having mechanisms in place for reflecting those advances in understanding is incredibly valuable, a benefit to public health, the environment, and the many companies who continue to innovate to find new ways to operate and grow their businesses without burdening their neighbors with harmful pollution.  Indeed, this framework is good news for just about every stakeholder except one: the polluters who put their personal earnings above the well-being of others, embracing a profit maximization scheme that turns on continuing to shove the costs of pollution onto society at large—costs that we can name, like heart attacks, asthma, developmemental delays, death, missed work days, ER visits, climate impacts of every shape and size. Costs that we can name, but they don’t want to count.  These polluters are so indebted to the status quo that they devote mind-bending amounts of energy, labor, and capital not to innovate, not to improve, but instead to do everything they can to stall change.  And that’s what brings this latest benefit-cost data manipulation to bear: a polluter-friendly administration desperate to bury the mounting evidence of all the progress still clearly needed to be made.  The promise and limitations of benefit-cost analysis  Benefit-cost analysis is intended to help provide context for the potential impacts of an action, such as strengthening a standard, by tallying up and comparing the anticipated benefits and costs, both direct and indirect. Its relevance to Clean Air Act rulemakings varies: in some sections of the Clean Air Act, the practice can help inform decisions, though not be itself solely determinative; in other parts of the Clean Air Act, such as in setting standards for toxics, the decision must instead be primarily health based.  Benefit-cost analysis is conceptually alluring specifically because it suggests certainty in the face of complex questions, affording a clear-cut tabulation of the benefits and the costs. In practice, however, such certainty is often a veneer, with analyses quickly complicated by the challenges of anticipating impacts, as well as in the challenges of quantifying and monetizing them—especially when it comes to impacts to human health and the environment.  The ultimate irony of the current cost-benefit fight is that in part due to the above uncertainties, intransigent polluters first advanced cost-benefit analysis as a tool to stymy regulation under the Reagan administration. Now, they assert it overcorrects.   What’s changed?  Our steadily growing understanding of the towering benefits of reducing pollution further.  Suddenly, it’s not just polluter projections of regulatory burdens that are inked in the ledger—now, ever more of those benefits from pollution reductions can be tallied up, too. And the benefits are clearly outweighing the costs.  Time to tip the scales; time to make the bodies go away.  The administration’s solution to pollution is delusion  Despite its challenges and limitations, when conducted well, benefit-cost analysis can provide important and useful insights. Therefore, a large amount of guidance has been developed over the years to help achieve as rigorous and robust an outcome as possible—including leading and long-standing guidance from the government in the form of the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) Circular A-4, as well as the EPA’s own long-standing expert guidance addressing such analyses, too.  Changes by the Trump administration’s EPA fly in the face of all that.  Specifically, to justify regulatory inaction and ensure that polluters can always come out on top, the agency has been advancing a permanent tipping of scales by:  Sidelining the science that illuminates the costs of pollution on public health and the environment; Slashing the value of included benefits; and Marginalizing the consideration of any additional benefits that remain.  The first of these is advancing under separate cover at the EPA with potentially devastating public health consequences, attempting to knock out of consideration the very public health studies that have revealed the magnitude of pollution’s harm on human health.  The second has been a repeated attack throughout the administration, with particular concern surrounding the agency’s mistreatment and devaluing of particulate matter and the social cost of carbon.  And the third is the primary focus here: marginalizing what counts as a benefit. Here the EPA is focused on sidelining the use of “co-benefits,” or benefits that occur as a result of a rule but were not the focused intention of the rule, such as particulate matter reductions occurring due to coal plants installing mercury pollution controls.  Co-benefits are a win-win, with multiple pollutants reduced on account of just one pollutant controlled. Or at least, they should be considered a win-win—unless you don’t want pollution reductions to look beneficial. Then, co-benefits become polluter enemy number one.  As a result, the Trump administration is attempting to take those co-benefits and kick them into the margins. And for this administration’s purposes, once those benefits are buried in the fine print, they are as good as gone.  The net result of all this whittling away?  A manipulation of facts so great such that without changing air quality at all, the clear and compelling motivation to act can simply, suddenly, on paper no longer be there. Not because the air is cleaner, but because under the Trump administration, the EPA has found a way to no longer value clean air.   What lies ahead  In 2018, the Trump administration’s EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking suggesting that “inconsistencies” in application of benefit-cost analysis were disrupting EPA rulemakings.  The action was widely panned and forcefully rebuked.  Now, they are putting forward a narrower proposal focused on just the Clean Air Act.  In the time between, the Trump administration’s EPA has applied its own data manipulation tactics inconsistently, selectively touting benefits when it helps its case or axing benefits otherwise. What does stay consistent is that each time, polluter interests are elevated over those of the public.  To attempt to advance what otherwise defies logic and technical expertise, this effort must be riddled with bad-faith arguments and legally dubious claims. But even error-pocked, the potential significance of the consequences, coupled with the parallel effort to sideline scientific studies, create far too great a threat to public health to ignore.  After three and a half long years of the Trump administration’s attack after senseless attack on specific health and environmental protections, we cannot let the craven greed of a select polluting few undercut the whole of the mission of the EPA, to protect public health and the environment.  We will keep fighting back. And we will not be alone.  The people, and the fight, will not be confined to the margins.

Over the past 10 years, Health in Harmony has helped lift communities in Indonesian Borneo from poverty by providing sustainable, local livelihoods that have dramatically reduced their reliance on logging.  Webb says she and her colleagues were able to accomplish this by listening to what communities really needed and to their ideas about possible solutions; she says Health in Harmony’s model could be applied to other communities around the world, even those in developed countries.  On a larger scale, Webb says governments need to stop prioritizing economic growth; she says the COVID-19 crisis highlights the danger of reliance on global supply chains, and that working together and moving toward a “regenerative economy” would help humanity weather future pandemics — as well as prevent them from happening in the first place.  Dr. Kinari Webb believes this because she has witnessed it — up close: Amid this global pandemic, the health of the planet is intricately connected to public health around the world.  In an op-ed she co-authored in The Hill in connection with Earth Day, she wrote: “The coronavirus is perhaps the biggest wakeup call we have ever had to the fact that failing to take nature into account puts our own health in danger.”  More than a decade ago, Webb, a medical doctor and founder of the nonprofit Health in Harmony, plunged into a remote jungle community of 60,000 mostly impoverished people in Indonesian Borneo near Gunung Palung National Park. She had gone there first to study orangutans. Logging was rampant. Local agriculture was anemic. The health of the population was often dire.  Through some 400 initial hours of community discussions — “radical listening,” Webb calls it — she and her team learned that many were logging, and thus destroying precious ecosystems, in order to pay for health care. They worked to change that dynamic. By training locals in sustainable agriculture and offering health care at deep discounts if logging ceased, they saw significant results. Improved infant mortality and public health. Drastically reduced deforestation. Recovering ecosystems along with the biodiversity living within the rainforests.  Can radical listening and community-based solutions focusing heavily on environmental protection and public health point the way toward preventing the next pandemic? In an exclusive interview with Mongabay, Webb tackles that question and others on the way toward suppressing laughter while imagining what she’d say if President Trump invited her to speak at a COVID-19 press conference at the White House.  Mongabay: As this virus started in China and slowly spread to other parts of the world, at what point did you start thinking about the connection between what we are seeing in this public health crisis and our concurrent environmental crisis involving climate change?  Kinari Webb: Instantaneously. I have spent the last 15 years trying to help the world understand these intimate interconnections. How if we destroy ecosystems and invade into them, and if we continue to trade wild animals around the world, then pandemics from viruses coming out of tropical ecosystems will happen over and over again.  And, because of the work that we do, I am constantly thinking about how human health, if it’s threatened, can lead to the further destruction of ecosystems. That destruction is harmful locally as well as globally. If there is any shift in the global perspective that can come out of this pandemic, I hope it is to reach a much greater understanding of how we are intimately interconnected with the natural world. It is impossible to separate us.  Environmentalists and health professionals like yourself have been preaching this for a long time. But deforestation is accelerating. Species extinctions are rising. Poaching and trading in wild animals are still flourishing. Why isn’t this message getting through?  I think people don’t realize the level of change that humanity is capable of. I think when people looked at climate change, they said, “How are we supposed to deal with this? Can we stop international flights? Can we stop burning coal? Can we stop deforesting for more agriculture and mining?” For many, the answer is no. Many people who look at our world and conclude we are so dependent on growth for all of our economic systems that we don’t have a choice but to keep going like this.  Indonesia, with its vast rainforests, just announced under its Paris Agreement pledge that it would prioritize growth over more ambitious emissions reductions.  I honestly think one of the things the pandemic is teaching us is that that kind of reaction is a false choice. We are seeing what we are capable of when we realize something is serious. So what would happen if we rebuilt our world economy around sustainability and ecological balance? In the “donut model” of economic theory, there needs to be a floor; everyone in the world needs their basic needs met. But there also needs to be a ceiling. There is a capacity at which the Earth can handle, but not beyond that. Carbon emissions are making climate change worse. Destruction of our ecosystems is messing with the local and global balance of the planet. But there is a large space between the floor and the ceiling. And humanity can thrive within that space. And so can the natural world. If they both don’t thrive, we’re not going to survive. Climate change could be the end of the road. The COVID-19 crisis is a speedbump, admittedly a big speedbump. But if we don’t figure out an economic system not built around growth, we won’t survive.  You are now channeling Pope Francis, among others. This is essentially what he wrote in his 2015 papal encyclical, Laudato si’: we have this consumer-based global economy, this throwaway society and this sense that the resources of the planet are inexhaustible, which they are not.  For the majority of people in the developing world, this connection is extremely clear. In communities where I work in Borneo, they will point up to the hill. If there is forest there, there is water running down from the hills, which is feeding my rice field, which is feeding my family. There is a very clear connection for them. But many of the people in the developed world, particularly in the United States, they are very disconnected from that. They don’t feel the impact — in our bodies. And now, here we are experiencing it.  One of the things that’s so powerful is seeing what collective action all together means. I used to think, “What I do is so small compared to the scale of the problems.” But now, I believe, if we all act together — on a global scale — look what can happen. This is a profound learning moment for the planet. We can actually change our behavior if we decided to.  You are referring to this global shutdown of the economy and the emission reductions we’re seeing as a result. But are we really learning this lesson? And if we are, will we follow these lessons as we move to reopen the world economy?  It depends on what happens from here, right? I am, and many people I know, are working so hard to help people see a new vision. That we don’t want to go back to the way things were. That is the path to more pain and destruction.  How do you define the way things were?  I suppose like Pope Francis. A complete consumer-based economy. A throwaway society. An attitude about economics that says that we don’t have to take the planet into consideration. And a belief in growth as the only economic model. Even the Green New Deal places a heavy emphasis on growth in a green economy. Actually, our politicians have to be brave enough to say what we know is true: we can’t keep growing as we have. We must have a regenerative economy where things are not wasted, where we know the entire life cycle of everything produced, and where we have more localized economic systems. This pandemic has also really shown us that. We can’t be so dependent on supply chains that are global. Right now, we’re seeing how dangerous that is.  Help me with an example of what you’re thinking about.  I’ve been working for many years in these small communities around Gunung Pulung National Park [in Indonesian Borneo]. These are traditional communities, but when we first came, they were not growing all of the food that they needed to eat. They were growing almost enough rice, mostly through slash-and-burn, but they were not growing enough vegetables. They were importing those. It was quite crazy. But they didn’t know how to grow vegetables because their ancestral history was getting food from the forests. Yet they had destroyed the forests while adding many more people. They were telling us, slash-and-burn is not working for us. We want to learn how to farm in one place without expensive chemical fertilizers because we don’t have the money for that.  In fact, they were logging to afford the expensive fertilizers in order to plant a crop. They knew this was crazy. They asked us: please train us in sustainable agriculture techniques, and, we also need access to affordable health care so we can stop logging. We listened. We trusted them. We helped them in the ways they asked. Now, they are growing all their own vegetables. In the first 10 years of the program, we saw a 90% drop in logging households. We stabilized the loss of primary forests. We had 52,000 acres [21,000 hectares] of logged forests grow back. The locals now say, the forested hills now bring more water. They are making money. It became a regenerative economy that honored the natural world and honored human well-being. So I know that double thriving is possible.  That’s what Health in Harmony has achieved in the jungles of Borneo. But most of us work in offices, factories and warehouses. Can a model resembling that be achieved in, say, urban cities in the U.S.?  I’ll give you an example that is metaphorically similar to other contexts. We got down to 10% of previous loggers [in Borneo]. These were a different category of people. They didn’t own land. They owned their chainsaws. And they didn’t have skills to do something else. Logging is all they knew. We wanted to help them shift. But we knew it wouldn’t be easy. So we started a chainsaw buyback program and established an angel investing network. We helped them start small, sustainable businesses. If they failed, we lost money; it was our risk. The businesses they started were service-oriented and regenerative. They have been wildly successful. And we helped them with training in managing money. We have only had two businesses fail out of 190 we invested in. Imagine inner-city Chicago. Imagine investing there in regenerative businesses. Help them with training and create a different kind of life.   You believe that.  Yes. But I am not the one to say how that should work. Our whole principle is built around what I call radical listening. We listen to the local community about what the solutions are. We don’t dictate what they should do. Our experience is local communities know exactly what the solutions are. They are just missing resources or opportunities or knowledge. If they have it, they can start a positive spiral of doing better. And do that by honoring the natural world.  We already have a lot of entrepreneurial support programs across the country. You envision the need for more.  I do. And I think we need to localize a lot of what we create in the world. Depending on so much from China for so many of our parts and products is not a great idea.  All of this takes leadership, especially at the federal level. But the U.S. has ceded that leadership role when it comes to environmental protection, climate mitigation and the need to transition to a carbon-free economy.  I believe if we rely on our federal governments and we believe that they are the ones who will get us out of this crisis, we won’t make it. I believe we will have to mobilize as humans on this planet to work together, regardless of what our governments do. There is a fundamental problem with a government. Its mandate is to protect its own country. Humans don’t have that mandate. Humans understand that we’re all in this together, and that we’re going to have to work together if we’re going to make it. And that’s what we at Health in Harmony are trying to create — basically a technological system for connecting people around the planet so that resources can flow to rainforest communities regardless of what governments are doing. We may not be able to make it without governments. But a belief that that is the only way to survive is a recipe for failure.  You would still need some kind of global, organizing body, wouldn’t you?  Or a nonprofit system that is more democratized. That’s probably the route we need to go. We also have to prioritize. If you had a system where radical listening was done all over the world, we would need to triage, prioritizing rainforests communities. If we lose our rainforests, its game over for the planet. They absorb 30% of the pollution we emit every year. They harbor half of the world’s species. They are critical for weather production. So we start our radical listening there, asking them what they need from the world community as “thanks yous” in return for protecting these rainforests. Then you get those “thank yous” to them, whether from companies, individuals, governments. I don’t care where they come from. But it would have to be under the careful control of local communities. They get to decide what they need, and then they give a gift back to the world in the form of ecosystem services from the rainforests on which we all depend.  Coming back to COVID-19 — we have birds and mammals, scientists tell us, harboring 1.5 million viruses, half of which would be infectious to humans. As we encroach on their habitats, we come closer and closer to triggering the next virus transfer and epidemic or pandemic.  The risk is enormous. But please remember, if an ecosystem is healthy and in balance, it is likely that those viruses are going to be controlled within their ecosystems, so it’s not an issue. With malaria, we know that when you log the rainforest, malaria goes way up. Mosquitoes thrive. Less frogs to eat the mosquitos. The balance is out of whack. If we have balanced ecosystems, the risk is much lower. And then, it’s an enormous problem when you are taking animals from one ecosystem — like pangolins, collected from all over Southeast Asia, throughout Indonesia and shipped to places like China. These animals are incredibly stressed. Any viruses they have are likely to be blooming as their immune systems are going crazy. And then, they get put in markets with all kinds of other animals without natural immunity. Whether or not that’s how COVID-19 came into the world, that is a ticking time bomb if we allow that to keep happening.  How do you deal with a country like China that wants these exotic animals for medicinal use? You’re a doctor; what do you make of this?  One of the problems in China is that the government really promotes Chinese medicine. Some really good stuff has come from Chinese medicine. But there’s a nationalistic pride in this. China recently banned these outdoor markets, which is good, but it gave an exemption for medicine, which isn’t really helpful. China is very good at science. They should be doing high-quality trials on whether the use of pangolin scales, for example, is actually therapeutic. And if they are, let’s create that molecule in the lab and leave the pangolins go free.  We can go dark here. If you look at the metrics, environmental protection is going in the wrong direction. Leadership is going in the wrong direction. You know all that. And yet — where do you derive your hope?  That’s easy. From communities in Borneo. You have to swim in the right direction, even when the storm is coming directly at you. It may feel hopeless. But you have to do your part. I really thought the work we were starting in Borneo was hopeless. But today? Those communities tell me: “We are the pathfinders for the way the world needs to go. And we’re ready to teach the world.” They give me hope.  OK, bear with me here. A miracle happens. You get invited to a COVID-19 White House press briefing with the president. In some crazy fantasy, he decides to give Dr. Webb time to address the nation. What do you say?  [Laughing as the question unspools, then stops.] What I would say is this pandemic is teaching us that we are not separate from the natural world. And that we cannot be healthy and thrive without healthy, natural ecosystems. That is even more true of our climate and our planet. And if we do not prioritize that kind of health and well-being, what we are seeing now will be nothing — nothing — compared to the destruction we will experience.  But — if we all work together, if we recognize the priorities of our joint health and well-being, we can all thrive. If we protect our natural ecosystems, it is much less likely that another virus like this will come for us and damage the whole planet. If we work together to regenerate our economy in a way that gives us health and well-being for the long-term future, we can all thrive. That’s what I would say.

There is nothing more connected than the health of our planet and our own human health. I hope we may be starting to realize this, at last, with COVID-19.  I think we are seeing this more clearly, now that COVID-19 has been with us for several weeks. “Seeing clearly” literally, as it happens, in some parts of the world, where it seems a veil of pollution has been lifted. This is particularly noticeable in smog-ridden cities such as Delhi and Los Angeles. Of course – there are no vehicles on the road.  But why and how might COVID-19 be connected to air pollution? It has been a public health issue globally for a long while – including in Jamaica. Air pollution is a hidden killer of several million people around the world each year. Sometimes it is obvious – as when we see a hillside burning in a bush fire, or the dump at Riverton City smoking. In the past we have often spoken about something called “particulate matter” – extremely tiny particles (soot, dust, droplets etc) that we take into our lungs when we inhale. We cannot see these of course, but they impact our health – not only our lungs but our heart and other organs. Research is starting to suggest that these particles may actually carry the coronavirus. We shall see.  Although no direct link between air pollution and a high number of deaths from the virus has been proved (a recent Harvard University study suggests there is a link) we must pay attention to the fact that we may have created the toxic environment for it to thrive. Northern Italy, where the highest number of cases and deaths have been, is the most heavily industrialized part of the country. COVID-19 is especially dangerous for those with underlying health problems – including chronic issues such as asthma and heart disease. Air pollution exacerbates these conditions. Many of these could be our vulnerable senior citizens.  Air pollution in Jamaica exceeds the World Health Organization’s (WHO) guidelines – this we already know. In poorer neighborhoods, air quality tends to be worse. Ironically, several years ago the community of Portmore was found to be suffering in particular (and now it has COVID-19). It may seem hopeless – climate change, industrial pollution and other factors that are way beyond our own control.  But we can do more to help ourselves.  As we have been saying repeatedly during the COVID-19 pandemic, as individuals we can do more to protect our health and the health of others. One of them is to stop open burning. This is harmful to everyone’s health. A friend in western Jamaica tells me her neighbors think nothing of setting light to a pile of garbage or garden waste. Visibly large pieces of soot land in her yard:  However, this regular practice seems to be overlooked by the police and local authorities. Enforcement is weak. In fact, workers employed by local authorities themselves, when asked to clean up or “bush” an area, often build bonfires as they go along. Even natural materials from the yard, if burned, do release harmful particles into the air. Sometimes, plastics get burned too, adding to the poisonous mix in the air we breathe. There is also the risk of fires getting out of control, especially in the hot and windy weather we are having now.  We have time to think on these matters – we are staying “a yaad” much more than previously, of course. So, why don’t we drop some of our lazy, bad habits, and find alternatives?  Composting is an obvious (and easy) solution to the garden waste, which does not need to be burned. Nuh Dutty Up Jamaica last year launched a video tutorial – take a look at it here. Composting is not rocket science!  What of all the plastics you are collecting and cannot currently dispose of? Well, Recycling Partners of Jamaica is asking recyclers to store clean plastics until depots reopen – hopefully in mid-May. And, as should always be the case, try to cut down on plastic consumption in the home and buy products that are compostable.  COVID-19 makes us realize how precious every breath we take is to our health and wellbeing. It’s a lesson that we need to keep re-learning – and do something about it. While taking action ourselves, let us put real pressure on our leaders to take air pollution seriously and put in place all the proper monitoring and enforcement systems.  We really don’t want to choke to death.

In recent awards ceremony history, only a few brave souls have done so. In 2018, the practice had a moment: Tiffany Haddish’s $4,000 Alexander McQueen gown became her punchline during the awards cycle, Cate Blanchett was praised for recycling her 2014 Armani gown that same year, and Rita Moreno wore her 1962 Oscars dress for the Academy Awards.  In January, Joaquin Phoenix announced that he would wear only one Stella McCartney tuxedo on the 2020 awards red carpet to promote sustainable fashion. For the Joker star — an awards favorite — this move fits in with other aspects of his moral philosophy; he’s an outspoken environmentalist and animal rights supporter.  This man is a winner… wearing custom Stella because he chooses to make choices for the future of the planet. He has also chosen to wear this same Tux for the entire award season to reduce waste. I am proud to join forces with you... x Stella#JoaquinPhoenix #GoldenGlobes pic.twitter.com/Ymbkl78ecN — Stella McCartney (@StellaMcCartney) January 6, 2020  The red carpet has increasingly become the place for celebrities to make bold political (if not performative) statements in favor of causes like climate change and Me Too. Because it’s 2020, the urgency of the impending climate crisis hasn’t escaped Hollywood. Celebrities have spearheaded fundraisers and founded charities for the cause (looking at you, Leonardo DiCaprio), but relatively few have cut back on new awards attire.  Phoenix’s decision makes a statement about waste in the fashion world and on the awards season’s many red carpets, but it also highlights an awkward reality about expectations for male and female stars in Hollywood; namely, do most people even realize that these men were picking up new tuxes for every show? And if not, does that undercut his message?  The replies to Stella McCartney’s tweet about Phoenix’s choice are not what one might call supportive: her claim that he’s a “winner” is met with responses ranging from a sarcastic “how brave!” to an equally flip reminder that firefighters and charity workers exist.  As a regular person who enjoys awards shows, it’s surprising to me that male actors don’t have just one or two tuxes they rotate throughout the season. It’s a widely shared opinion that — other than Billy Porter — men’s red carpet attire stylistically pales in comparison to women’s. Phoenix’s 2020 re-wearable ’fit is a simple and classic well-tailored black tux topped up with a bow tie. Fashion-wise, it isn’t a red carpet highlight, but it fits with his history of red carpet looks (mostly: more black tuxes).  That’s a strange thing about red carpet fashion: These outfits are intended to be worn once by celebrities, whether they’re very expensive or time-consuming to make or even totally forgettable. Within this system, Phoenix really is bucking the status quo.  However, it might be more difficult for an actress to repeat a gown, according to Moya Luckett, a media historian at New York University. With modern red carpet attire, most high-profile celebrities are at the whims of their stylists, management companies, and the fashion houses they’re contracted under.  “With the end of the studio system in the 1960s, actors and actresses became free agents, signing with talent agencies who then partnered them with stylists and designers to help with publicity,” Luckett told me. Prominent actresses could be restricted from repeating an outfit due to promotional contracts with designers, she added. They’re also likely to be subjected to harsher fashion scrutiny than their male peers.  “The red carpet revolves around fashion so much more than the film,” Luckett said. “Even with very popular male stars like Phoenix, Timothee Chalamet, or Jared Leto, they’re given far less attention [by the press] than their female counterparts.”  Television and, lately, social media has turned the red carpet into a spectacle, where the celebrities’ appearances are sometimes more important than the films themselves, Luckett said. “The idea of wearing the same dress multiple times is difficult, especially if a star is contracted with a designer to promote their work throughout that year,” she added. Actors and their styling teams need publicity, and the red carpet is often the easiest way to get that attention.  “The red carpet revolves around fashion so much more than the film”  Phoenix, however, has garnered attention by promoting the causes he cares about this awards cycle. The actor’s acceptance speech for best actor in a motion picture drama at this year’s Golden Globes put his fellow celebrities and their private jets in the spotlight, and he recently participated — and even got arrested — at a climate change protest. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Phoenix is responsible for the plant-based menus debuting at several award shows. Similarly, McCartney, the actor’s partnered designer, has a history of working with sustainable design choices — not using animal skins, recycling textiles, and being somewhat transparent with her company’s sustainability efforts. As Luckett explains, “the decision fits in perfectly with both of their brands.”  The concept of sustainability on the red carpet isn’t new. Some celebrities at the Met Gala in years past have participated in the Green Carpet Challenge by wearing sustainably sourced goods or rewearing a certain accessory. The practice is still niche among most celebrities, although Hollywood stylists are becoming more aware of the public’s eco-friendly sentiments, Cate Blanchett’s stylist told the Hollywood Reporter in 2018. “We need to get the word out to get rid of this ridiculous notion that dresses cannot be worn twice,” she said.  For now, Joaquin Phoenix appears to be the only popular outfit-repeater on the 2020 red carpet. Unless, that is, you count the red carpet itself at the Golden Globes, which the Hollywood Foreign Press Association wants to use again.  Sign up for The Goods’ newsletter.

Reaction from foot soldiers of the progressive movement ranged from outright disenchantment that Biden didn’t pick one of their own to cautious optimism that she could be pressured to advance their causes.  “The fact that the Wall Street wing of the Democratic Party praised Biden's VP choice is probably not a very good sign for progressives,” said Max Berger, an activist for liberal causes and a former aide to Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign.  Berger said a Biden-Harris administration would be “responsive” to progressives. But he doubted that Harris would become a force for the movement as Warren would have, and fretted that as vice president she would become the favorite in the next presidential contest against more left-leaning figures.  “From an electoral perspective, it's a great pick,” said Berger, who argued that Harris could excite women as well as Black and brown Americans. “From a governing perspective, it's a wash. From a long-term perspective, it's a disaster.”  Briahna Joy Gray, the press secretary for Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign, was more blunt, accusing Biden of displaying “contempt for the base” by picking a “top cop” in Harris, referring to her past actions as a California prosecutor that have drawn fire from some criminal justice advocates.  Other liberals said Harris recognizes the power of the movement.  “She may not be the first or even second choice for many people, but there’s no question that she’s someone the progressive movement can work with,” said Charles Chamberlain, the chair of the Democracy For America, an advocacy group that backed Sanders.  Chamberlain said he would have preferred to see Warren or former Georgia lawmaker Stacey Abrams, who have closer ties to the progressive movement, claim the VP nomination. Still, he said, “Kamala Harris is a smart leader who is capable of understanding the winds of change.”  Underlying the hesitation with Harris are her relatively thin record on the national stage and her shifting stances in the Democratic primary. She endorsed the Sanders-led Medicare for All Act in 2017, just months after first becoming a senator, but waffled on the elimination of private insurance under pressure in the 2020 presidential race and eventually backtracked from it.  As a presidential candidate she was quick to embrace transformative causes on the left, but took steps to be viewed as moderate and pragmatic. Sometimes, her actions were difficult to square: She embraced the idea of a Green New Deal to abolish fossil fuels even as she insisted she was not trying to “restructure society.”  The effort to appeal to competing wings of the party at once faltered, and led to Harris’ undoing in the primary. But the attendant difficulty in defining her has now worked to Biden’s benefit, with the Trump campaign's confusing and self-contradictory initial attacks on Harris as both a determined “radical” and “phony” who was merely pretending to hold those positions.  Chamberlain said that for progressives, it would be “absolutely critical” to exert pressure from the outside to force Biden and Harris to deliver on movement priorities like health care, climate change and more, while adding that “Joe Biden could have done a lot worse” in his running mate selection.  Alexandra Rojas, executive director of the left-wing group Justice Democrats, also cited the importance of \"pressure from outside\" to push Biden and Harris. She noted that the party's current platform is more progressive than it was under President Barack Obama or 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton.  \"With a growing Squad, the Democrats in Congress in 2021 are much more progressive than who Obama had to deal with in 2009,\" said Rojas, whose group supported Sanders in the Democratic primary. “The Biden-Harris team is running on a more progressive platform than Obama and Hillary, so I'm hopeful we can continue to create the pressure to deliver solutions as big as the problems we face.”  Still, while progressive activists said they believed they might be able to achieve some victories in a Biden-Harris administration, some expressed concern that the decision could block the movement from elevating one of their own figures into the presidency for the remainder of the decade.  “The left would have been in a prime position to actually win the nomination in 2024 or 2028. And Kamala Harris will now represent the moderate wing of the party as a Black woman who has served as vice president, and that will be tremendously difficult to dislodge,” Berger said. “There's an argument to be made that the moderate wing of the party has just secured control for maybe the ’20s.”  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 11, "joy": 6, "negative": 10, "disgust": 1, "positive": 33, "anger": 11, "surprise": 1, "fear": 5, "trust": 3}, "metadata": ["washington", "harris", "american", "progressive", "activists", "joe", "biden", "democratic", "elizabeth", "presidential", "warren", "bernie", "referring", "california", "criminal", "liberals", "advocacy", "ties", "leader", "endorsed", "medicare", "elimination", "fossil", "trump", "priorities", "climate", "party's", "obama", "nominee", "sanders", "solutions"]}, {"text": "Editor’s note: The Economist is making some of its most important coverage of the covid-19 pandemic freely available to readers of The Economist Today, our daily newsletter.

It was a route for escaped slaves, heading for Pennsylvania. It carried Abraham Lincoln to Gettysburg in 1863, and bore his body, 17 months later, on a leg of its journey home to Illinois. It is a hiking trail now, shaded by sycamore and willow. But for the pen-and-brush duo behind this column, the old railroad remains auspicious, as the access-point to a deep pool of the Gunpowder river, where trout lie.  It is not the best fishing spot on the Gunpowder. That is a couple of miles upstream, near the reservoir which, thanks to a decades-old agreement between the local anglers and city of Baltimore, releases a steady flow of water into the river. But any fish caught in that stretch must be put back. And the dispensation for angling in Maryland’s coronavirus lockdown rules applies only to fishing for food. So that is what Lexington, his nine-year-old son, and “Kal”, this newspaper’s cartoonist-in-chief, were set upon, one glorious recent afternoon, with an eagerness whetted by days cooped up.  They kept 12 feet apart, mind, while chatting and scrambling down the riverbank. This seemed not only sensible but representative of what fly-fishing is. It is a solo activity. Yet the technical demands of casting a long line to deliver a feathered hook to the water with, ideally, the delicacy of an insect alighting make its practitioners prone to lively exchanges of information: on rods, water, flies and so forth. An American master angler, Lee Wulff, called fly-fishing “the most social of all the solitary sports”. Pondering this, your columnist took his place on a sandbar dotted with beaver tracks, and began casting across the bottom of the pool, to where a jumble of rocks rose promisingly from its gravelly depths.  Maryland’s dispensation reflects the exalted place angling occupies in America. Around 50m Americans go fishing each year; not far off as many as voted for Donald Trump. A minority of them fly-fish. Yet the sport’s elite reputation, which came with it from 18th-century Britain, and the commitment of its devotees, have made it especially influential and revealing. Presidents from Grover Cleveland to George H.W. Bush have been devoted to it. Three have written books on fly-fishing: including Herbert Hoover and Jimmy Carter, who spent the day after his crushing electoral defeat in 1980 building an ingenious contraption to dry his fly-lines.  Fly-fishing’s success in America reflects above all the country’s natural bounty. Within a few decades of the technique being mainly practised by British officers, homesick for their own chalk streams, Americans were fly-fishing in diverse conditions for bass and many species of salmon and trout. This led them to innovate; some American fly patterns were based on native American lures. Yet the fly-fishing establishment remained concentrated on the Anglocentric east coast. This encouraged an unwarranted inferiority complex, which was compounded by the fact that early American fishing scribblers and fly-tiers tended to be British. The first great writer, Theodore Gordon, initially wrote for a British journal.  But even then America was showing its genius for popularising elite culture. This was partly a reaction to the snooty Anglos. “Our fish are too Republican, or too shrewd, or too stupid, to understand the science of English trout fishing,” wrote a peeved angler in 1830. A similar urge drove baseball to supplant American cricket around this time. Yet the growth of a New World fly-fishing tradition, more capacious than the British one, reflected above all America’s vast socioeconomic, as well as piscatorial, possibilities.  An exploding rail network opened up new angling paradises to thousands of first-generation fishers. The connection between infrastructure and wilderness was sometimes overt; the owners of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad offered a $20 gold piece to anyone who caught a 10lb trout alongside its tracks. Other entrepreneurs also seized the opportunity fly-fishing presented. Wisconsin’s fly-tying industry would soon produce over 10m lures a year. While the east-coast elite maintained an exclusive idea of fly-fishing, it had become a mass hobby.  The inevitable downside of this growth, overfishing and pollution, led to a pushback in the late 19th century. In the name of conservation, private fishing clubs grabbed areas that had previously been open to the public. Such enclosures at least led to better management—which was then applied nationally in the emerging conservation movement that fly-fishers had thereby helped launch. America’s angling lobby has sometimes erred from its strong environmental record. To maintain bipartisanship, it has said little about the ominous threat of climate change to America’s rivers. And rainbow and brown trout—which the Lexington team was after—are two of America’s most invasive species. But as the Gunpowder, once a stagnant trickle, goes to show, the billion-dollar angling industry remains a powerful force for conservation.   An angle on fishing  American fly-fishing is still evolving. Recent decades have seen a big expansion in saltwater fly-fishing, pioneered by Lefty Kreh, a Marylander who helped broker the Gunpowder agreement. It has also become fashionable, due to interest from Hollywood and social media. Apparently, it does well on Instagram. Fly-fishing has been America’s fastest-growing category of fishing in recent years.  Anchored in local topography, hydrology and culture, it has meanwhile retained local differences amid such national trends. According to Walter Wiese, a fishing guide in Montana, east-coast anglers, being accustomed to small rivers and trees, tend to be nimble but not big casters; west-coasters tend to be the opposite. Fly-fishing is a story of oscillating tensions between the masses and elite; tradition and innovation; regional against national concerns: it is an American parable.  It can be frustrating, too. After several hours flogging the river, Lexington had caught nothing. His son had meanwhile landed a plump brown trout. Fishing always sorts the men from the boys.■   Dig deeper:  For our latest coverage of the covid-19 pandemic, register for The Economist Today, our daily newsletter, or visit our coronavirus tracker and story hub  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 21, "positive": 16, "negative": 14, "disgust": 2, "joy": 2, "anger": 5, "surprise": 1, "fear": 6, "trust": 2}, "metadata": ["pandemic", "coronavirus", "northern", "agreement", "applies", "american", "donald", "commitment", "influential", "george", "america", "infrastructure", "wilderness", "entrepreneurs", "overfishing", "environmental", "climate", "dig"]}, {"text": "The union representing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) workers began negotiating a new contract with the agency Tuesday. But the workers are not just fighting for a fair contract or better working conditions. They are also fighting for the ability to do their jobs in an administration hostile to science and environmental regulations.  \"EPA employees have committed our careers to protecting human health and the environment, working day-in and day-out to keep our air clean, ensure our water is safe to drink, and clean up our land so that we may live and work on it,\" AFGE Local 1236 President Bethany Dreyfus said in a statement reported by The Hill . \"Yet time and time again, the Administration has attempted to silence research and gut our labor rights. That's why we're not just standing up for a fair contract, we're fighting to be able to do our jobs and protect public health — and we'll keep fighting until our voices are truly heard.\"  The EPA workers, represented by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), have put forward a Bill of Rights that includes the right to scientific integrity, the right to enforce environmental laws and the right to help solve, research and discuss the climate crisis .  The Bill of Rights comes in response to the Trump administration's sidelining of science and commitment to environmental rollbacks. The AFGE pointed to a December 2019 New York Times article that detailed how the administration was cutting funding for research projects, pressuring some researchers not to speak publicly and relying less on science when making regulations. It has gotten so bad that even the EPA Science Advisory Board stuffed with Trump appointees said three major Trump-era policies ran counter to sound science. In particular, the board called out rollbacks of Obama-era water protections and emissions standards for cars and light trucks, as well as a rule limiting the kinds of studies that can be used to draft public health regulations.  All of this sidelining and deregulation has impacted morale at the EPA and even caused some people to leave. The New York Times cited the case of Matthew Davis, a biologist who left the EPA after 10 years. Davis' research on how mercury impacts children's health had been used to bolster rules limiting mercury pollution from coal fired plants, but he was then asked to help justify the rollback of those same regulations.  \"I am now part of defending this darker, dirtier future,\" he told The New York Times.  Marie Owens Powell, who works for the EPA in Philadelphia as an underground storage tank enforcement officer, told HuffPost she planned to deliver the Bill of Rights to the agency with other staffers so that workers would not feel so disempowered and demoralized.  \"We needed some kind of vehicle ... so these employees would feel like they had a voice,\" Powell told HuffPost. \"As an employee for the past 27 years, I've never seen staffing levels cut this much, research stalled and morale at an all-time low.\"  The union, which represents 7,500 EPA workers, is also demanding more conventional labor rights. The negotiations come after the agency unilaterally imposed a contract in the summer that decreased employees' chances to work remotely and kicked union officials out of their offices.  AFGE District 7 President Nicole Cantello told reporters that the administration \"declared war\" on the EPA's staff by imposing the contract, The Chicago Sun-Times reported.  The Federal Labor Relations Authority eventually agreed with the union that the government had bargained in bad faith by imposing the contract, according to HuffPost.  \"… Donald Trump took away many of those rights guaranteed under our collectively bargained contract and imposed … a unilateral anti-employee directive,\" EPA scientist Loreen Targos said, according to The Chicago Sun-Times. \"We fought for six months for a seat at the table to win back our rights that were taken away.\"  ", "emotions": {"anticipation": 13, "positive": 22, "negative": 3, "disgust": 2, "joy": 3, "anger": 9, "surprise": 3, "fear": 4}, "metadata": ["environmental", "protecting", "ensure", "labor", "american", "scientific", "climate", "crisis", "trump", "administration's", "commitment", "funding", "researchers", "relying", "emissions", "studies", "matthew", "impacts", "pollution", "coal", "donald"]}]}
